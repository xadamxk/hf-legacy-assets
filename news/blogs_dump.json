You may be very curious to explore interests or hobbies that channel the passionate and competitive side of your nature.\r\n\r\nPlus, with a delightful sun-Venus connection on Tuesday, this is a perfect chance to break the ice and ask that special person on a date. It could be a heartwarming experience. In general, this is not the time to hide away but to get out and enjoy the experience of living and loving.\r\n\r\nFriday may need a little bit of care as an impulsive Mercury-Uranus tie could see you purchasing something on the spur of the moment. Later, though, you could regret it and feel you’ve wasted your money. A pause for thought would be helpful.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, feisty Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of lifestyle and wellness, inspiring you to get organized and jettison activities that you’ve lost interest in.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Once again, your home and family sector is the main focus, with plenty of action in this area. This could be the week you’re planning to hold a major celebration, reunion, or other get-together, in which case it could all go very well.\r\n\r\nTuesday could be particularly lovely for having family and friends around or perhaps doing something to beautify your place. This can be a lovely time for wandering around vintage shops or interior design offices and picking up some ideas and interesting pieces as well.\r\n\r\nThere may be a clash of opinions on Friday that could be difficult to resolve if both of you are being particularly stubborn. One of you will need to give way and find a compromise in order to move on.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, there’s a change of focus as warrior Mars moves into Virgo and your leisure sector. Whether you enjoy sports or you’re looking to date, you could be quite competitive.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Do you have something to say? It’s seems no one will be able to get a word in edgewise. With a powerful focus on your sector of communication, your conversation and desire to interact could ramp up several notches. If you work in sales, media, or tech, you could have a busy and productive week ahead of you. And with the sun merging with luscious Venus, it might be possible to sign a lucrative deal or bond with someone who can be of great benefit to you in the future.\r\n\r\nMercury angles toward restless Uranus on Friday, which could make it difficult to communicate. You may talk at cross purposes and end up completely misunderstanding each other. Not the best outcome if you’re going on a first date.\r\n\r\nAs fiery Mars moves into Virgo and your home zone over the weekend, this active influence could see you making short of work of tasks that have been on your domestic to-do list for a long time.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=3]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3399ff]Cancer ♋[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You might be on a mission to get your finances sorted out, but at the same time you might also have shopping on your mind. You may need to find a balance between the two if you’re going to keep money matters on an even keel.\r\n\r\nHowever, the focus on your sector of values could also be a call to consider your level of self-worth. Learning to love yourself could be one factor that helps increase your income.\r\n\r\nThe way you want to spend your Friday evening may be different than that of your friends. Go your own way and do your own thing, because you really can have more fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, as dynamic Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of communication on Saturday, you may be more proactive about promoting your work, getting organized, and networking with all the right people. It would help to avoid being too critical, though, of both yourself and others.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"With some empowering influences in your sign this week, you may feel as though you can accomplish anything. Your confidence looks high, and you’ll find it easy to express yourself, get help and support for your various plans and projects, and be the leader you naturally are.\r\n\r\nThis week can be excellent for a makeover, and a lovely transit involving sweet Venus might inspire you to reinvent yourself. This can be very self-affirming if you’ve recently been through a period of change and wish to embrace this more fully.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to connecting with your boss or someone in authority on Friday, there’s a chance you may not see eye to eye. While this won’t last too long, it’s best not to hold any important conversations at this time because they may not turn out the way you want.\r\n\r\nYour psyche may be more stirred up than usual from this weekend and for around six weeks.

Tuesday may bring possibilities if you’re going to a tai chi class or other group. Connecting with those who share your ideas and ideals could assist you in meeting someone very special.\r\n\r\nThis is very much a time to think about hiring the services of a life coach who can help you live to your full potential.\r\n\r\nHowever, your beliefs and those of another could clash on Friday. While it might drive you apart, it can also draw you together. You might really appreciate someone who thinks very differently than you.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, dynamic Mars moves into your sign for a six-week stay, enhancing your energy and courage.

This is one of the peak times of the year for enjoying life and setting in motion the process of connecting with others. You have more chances now to meet that special person, and encounters can be lively and stimulating. You’re very likely to stand out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut as feisty Mars moves into Virgo and a subtler sector of your chart, this is the time to do a little emotional housecleaning. Are you looking for closure on key issues? Use this opportunity to break free.\r\n\r\nYou may also feel moved to learn a spiritual practice, such as meditation or tai chi, so you can learn how to get out of your own way and flow with life.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"With a lively house party going on in Leo and your sector of goals and ambitions, this is no time to stay behind the scenes. The cosmos is encouraging you to promote your work in a big way and not hold back from letting others know what you can do. You’ll have a magnetic attraction about you that others may not be able to resist. If you’re eager to make a big splash, this is very much the time to do so.\r\n\r\nPlus, with the sun and lively Venus linking up on Tuesday, you can harness the benefit of this transit by doing a presentation or appearing in public. Don’t be surprised if good things come from this.\r\n\r\nTravel and adventure may beckon from Saturday when warrior Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of far horizons.

In fact, anything that can stretch your abilities and shift you out of your comfort zone has to be very good for you. The willingness to take a leap of faith could see you enjoying a steep learning curve.\r\n\r\nLater in the week, dynamic Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of goals, career, and ambitions. The coming six weeks are an opportunity to be more proactive regarding your plans. If you’ve faced obstacles, you’ll be ready to blast them out of the way.

However, it can be easier to do so if you have a counselor, therapist, or trusted friend to talk to. Sharing your feelings can melt away those blocks over time and lead to a healthier and wealthier you.\r\n\r\nRomantic partnerships could sizzle at this time because there are some very fiery energies kindling the flame of passion and encouraging you to spend more time together.\r\n\r\nFrom the weekend, thoughts of travel, exploring far horizons, and embracing the bigger picture could tempt you to be more adventurous.

It helps to be selective when choosing which events to attend because some may show more promise than others. Still, these lively influences can see you connecting with all kinds of people who may become part of a vibrant network.\r\n\r\nDon’t jump to conclusions on Friday, though, as an edgy angle between chatty Mercury and electric Uranus could see arguments brewing if you don’t take the time to listen.\r\n\r\nFinally, potent Mars moves into Virgo and a more intense sector of your chart on Saturday, which could stir up your psyche.

Whatever it is, finding ways to include these activities in your daily schedule can energize you and give you a bit of a buzz.\r\n\r\nThere is also the potential for romance at work or at the gym, and a first-time encounter could be fairly dramatic. It could even be love at first sight.\r\n\r\nWhen dynamic Mars moves into Virgo over the weekend, its six-week stay in this sector could encourage you to clear the air.

Even with these worries in mind, and with 30-year yields falling below short term yields, the market is confident that this is not something to be concerned about especially seeing that there is an increase in U.S consumer spending. U.S retail sales were up 0.7% in July 2019, far surpassing the 0.3% predicted rate. The day after the inversion happened and long-term yields fell below 2%, the only positive news was that the market is holding steady, anchored by U.S consumer sales numbers.[\/align]\r\n[font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium][i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-bonds\/u-s-30-year-yields-drop-to-fresh-record-low-below-2-idUSKCN1V51PN]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]As Recession Concerns Mount, Dozens of Central Banks Are Cutting Rates[\/color][\/b][\/size][\/font]\r\n[align=justify]Concerns about Brexit, trade wars and slowing global economic growth have driven banks to cut back on their interest rates to help stimulate borrowing and therefore prop up economies likely to be affected. Some of the surprises include New Zealand, India and Thailand, which lowered their interest rates. Even in the United States, Trump is urging the Federal Reserve to keep dropping its benchmark interest rates. All of this is being done to protect economies from the risk of a recession. Even if these interventions can help reduce the risks associated with a recession, they pose another problem: they could lead to a race to the bottom. In cutting interest rates and stimulating borrowing at home, governments weaken their currency to encourage the exportation of goods and services and discourage the importation of the same. The effect of this could be runaway currency depreciation around the world, unleashing the exact effects the interest rate cuts were supposed to prevent.[\/align]\r\n[font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium][i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/08\/15\/business\/economy\/central-bank-rate-cuts.html]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Alibaba earnings show Chinese consumers are still shopping despite trade war[\/color][\/b][\/size][\/font]\r\n[align=justify]Even with the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, Chinese consumers are still spending. Alibaba reports that it saw a 40% growth in sales in its latest quarter. Even if growth was expected, the reported 40% was much better than had been predicted by analysts. Mobile users and improved sales in their Taobao and Tmall platforms are thought to be behind this growth. With this announcement, Alibaba shares rose about 3%. This rise was short-lived as the share price fell the following day amid fears of a U.S recession. Another core part of Alibaba’s business, Alibaba computing unit also saw a 66% growth in sales over last year’s sales.[\/align]\r\n[font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium][i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2019\/08\/15\/investing\/alibaba-earnings\/index.html]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n   \r\n[\/size][\/font]\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=2890436][img]https:\/\/hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/trends-pikachu.png[\/img][\/url][\/align]\r\n[font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Stone Cold Steve Austin on Hot Ones[\/color][\/b] \r\nHere is yet another Hot Ones episode for you guys, this time they got none other than the world famous Stone Cold Steve Austin.

This week, though, you may also be turning to new ideas for inspiration, especially those that take you out of your comfort zone. \r\n\r\n With both the sun and chatty Mercury linking to Mars, you could be quite forceful about how you express yourself. At the same time, links to jovial Jupiter hint that you might come across as preachy unless you can tone this down. You may have a point to make, but the way you do it could be crucial to whether others accept it. \r\n\r\n And with sweet Venus and thoughtful Mercury angling toward dreamy Neptune, strive for balance and a chance to recharge even though you might be busy for much of the week. Sunday brings the chance of an outing that could be most enjoyable.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Leisure and pleasure activities could be very much on your mind this week and over the coming weeks and something you can indulge to your heart’s content. As the focus is also on the sign of Virgo, this can be one of the better times for learning a skill or hobby that involves fine detail. Or you might get involved in a creative project that requires a lot of finesse. If so, current influences can be perfect for making a success of it. \r\n\r\n Don’t discount the idea of earning money from a skill or ability or perhaps pooling resources with someone who can help you create a business from one of your talents. \r\n\r\n When it comes to romance and your social life, you could also be fairly busy. You may feel moved to take a budding romance further, but it’s best not to rush into anything. Take things they come rather than have big expectations.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You could be involved in family projects, have visitors, or be working to get your place shipshape. With an emphasis on your home zone, you might be doing a lot of entertaining, whether it’s friends, relatives, or people you work with. \r\n\r\n This may be the time you consider trying something like feng shui to get the energies in your home balanced and flowing. You may find that clearing away clutter from certain rooms and putting chimes, plants, or pieces of artwork in the right places can enhance the feel of your home. It might also bring success in other areas of life that correspond to certain areas and rooms. \r\n\r\n However, with both the sun and lively Mercury linking to sobering Saturn, this can be a good time to launch a home business.

Write it all down in the order of priority because this will make it easier to get things done. \r\n\r\n This can be a great opportunity to connect with others if you’re keen to collaborate on a project or need help with a certain plan. And if you’re ready to promote a business, website, or your brand, this is the time to go for it. \r\n\r\n With the sun and lively Mercury aligning in your holiday zone, the desire to escape is worthy of your consideration.

This is the time to get advice from financial experts who can help you streamline your affairs so you can take back control and regain your peace of mind. \r\n\r\n Even so, there could be a temptation to splurge, especially on outings, romantic dates, and generally enjoying life. That said, it’s not all about work. If you need to take a break to wind down, do so.

Accommodating other people’s needs may not be easy, particularly if you’re set on a certain course. Nevertheless, you likely can’t escape their demands, so you might need to compromise to keep the peace. \r\n\r\n This could also be the case with friends or a romantic partner. While this time is very much about you and your needs, the key people in your life certainly won’t want to be left out.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"This week and the coming weeks could see you involved in an annual phase in which the cosmos is encouraging you to take a back seat. With a focus on a more secluded and spiritual sector of your chart, and with four planets in this zone, this isn’t a time to put yourself forward. Rather, it’s an opportunity to take stock, find closure on certain issues, and tie up any loose ends. It’s important you do this so that you can start with a clean slate from September 23 when the sun moves into your sign. \r\n\r\n If you enjoy art therapy, journaling, creative writing, or keeping a dream diary, any or all of these activities can help you access buried emotions. Channeling deep-seated feelings in such a way could be very healing. \r\n\r\n However, if you do need the help of a teacher, life coach, or anyone else, just ask. Getting the perspective of someone else may be all it takes for something to shift.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Your social life could be keeping you on your toes. You may find yourself attending more events at this time than you have in some while. And you could be inclined to get involved in group or community projects or work as part of a team. This can be an excellent time for collaboration and planning events that involve groups of people. \r\n\r\n Keep an eye on expenses, though, because it could cost more than you think to attend parties, weddings, and celebrations and get involved in group activities. It wouldn’t hurt to keep tabs on what you spend and do what you can to lower costs or you could be surprised at the end of the month. \r\n\r\n In addition, there is also the potential for romance, and even if you aren’t looking, it could catch you unaware. With sweet Venus linking to dreamy Neptune on Wednesday and angling toward powerful Pluto over the weekend, feelings could intensify.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Having four planets in the topmost sector of your chart could see a sudden surge in goal-oriented planning and activity. You could find yourself busy with all kinds of opportunities. And whether you run your own business or work for another, this can be a time when the workload is greater than usual. Try to prioritize if you can, because being busy just for the sake of it will simply wear you out. \r\n\r\n Make time for a respite by arranging opportunities for some pampering, a massage, or some other form of relaxing downtime. \r\n\r\n At the same time, with luscious Venus, thoughtful Mercury, and the sun all angling toward expansive Jupiter in your sign, there could be some conflict between wanting to succeed and not wanting to push yourself. Discipline could be lacking at times, which is why it would be best to not overburden yourself. Even so, if there’s something you really want to accomplish, it’s worth putting in the hours.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=9]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#663333]Capricorn ♑[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You could feel an urge to move out of your comfort zone and explore new ideas and opportunities.

This is also the sector of higher education and publishing, so if you have a desire to explore a niche further and perhaps write about it, this is the time to start. It’s also important to listen to your intuition, which is the voice of your higher self. If you’re doing something because you think you should, it might not bring you any satisfaction.

Be careful about taking advice from others, because there are some who may seem to be knowledgeable but really know nothing. With such important issues at stake, it’s vital that you talk to people who know what they’re doing. \r\n\r\n There could also be tendency to splurge on social events just to feel better.

Certain planets linking to nebulous Neptune in your sign suggest you’ll need time out to relax and recharge. Because you tend to be sensitive to other people’s moods and feelings, too many vibes can be draining unless you take care of yourself. \r\n\r\n In addition, this isn’t the best time to work solo; instead, get on board with others and work as part of a team. You may find that you can accomplish much more together than you can alone.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n[\/list][font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium][\/spoiler]\r\n\r\n    \r\n[\/size][\/font]\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=2331053][img]https:\/\/hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/comics-mix.png[\/img][\/url][\/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center]\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 1 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/236x\/57\/ee\/fd\/57eefd9886797e941930acd5ab33541e.jpg[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 2 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ldyaxzbox1g31.jpg[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 3 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/e35\/66823378_146589803195866_783151841663793885_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=63bd885d95667c9f26ea136b522bf49b&oe=5DE0C711&ig_cache_key=MjEwNTI3ODM4NTUwODIyMDI5Mw%3D%3D.2[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 4 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i.gyazo.com\/d42449f5b2279d29e9390e258624ac69.png[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 5 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/scontent-prg1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/e35\/67094122_2090370561269288_5511032173929174131_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.cdninstagram.com&se=7&oh=205f7a3d0a8f24e8d21f60ea87679e3a&oe=5DD783DB&ig_cache_key=MjEwMjAzOTcwMDk2MDM0NjEzNA%3D%3D.2[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 6 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com\/vp\/adcfb00d159e65226f31e2435a133e49\/5DD528E0\/t51.2885-15\/sh0.08\/e35\/s640x640\/67411216_130429828217136_8782727436326420788_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 7 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com\/vp\/278f1fc323ec97a57ea761907959a55d\/5DE4566C\/t51.2885-15\/e35\/p1080x1080\/67681756_2250831948347821_2072027908781674033_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[\/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n ","subject":"Hack Forums News \/\/ Edition 443","tags":"HF News","dateline":"1567719660","approval_dateline":"1567898052"},

Some of the proposals put forward include a payroll tax cut, which is touted to boost the economy by allowing workers to take larger paychecks home, as well as rolling back some of President Trump’s tax cuts. Even though the president insists the economy is doing well, contingency plans are being put together in case the economy cannot hold a recession at bay. The payroll tax cut needs congressional approval, which advisers see as possible because similar interventions were taken during the Obama administration.

The Federal Reserve is mostly to thank for this growth as it decreased interest rates on home sales in July. The home sale marker was weary in December after the Federal Reserve raised these rates, but its reversal is giving hope to the National Association of Realtors. The cut in interest rate is interesting because it came at a time when unemployment is at its lowest level in almost 50 years, with the estimated unemployment numbers predicted to be more likely to cause an increase in interest rates and therefore a slowdown in home sales and purchases.

Experts are now warning that the federal debt, which is already untannable in is historical context, is heading towards unsustainable levels. All this is despite President Trump campaigning on the pledge to balance the budget and bring the federal deficit down. CBO, a nonpartisan group, forecasts that the deficit for this fiscal year will exceed $960 billion, with the number growing past the projected $12 trillion in the next one. The group also warned that the deficit is set to grow higher, especially on the realization that the U.S population is aging, which will increase healthcare costs in the coming decade.

You may be determined to make it happen, come what may. But be sure you want your prize once you have it. \r\n\r\n Activities this week can be fueled by a dreamy influence between jovial Jupiter and hazy Neptune, which could give you unrealistic expectations. You will do better to keep your feet on the ground, because all that glitters is not necessarily gold. \r\n\r\n As chatty Mercury angles toward prudent Saturn on Sunday, it could be difficult to get something across to another, or they simply may not want to hear it.

This peaks on Thursday with a very focused Mars-Pluto transit. If there’s something you have your mind set on accomplishing, you’ll work hard to make it happen. \r\n\r\n Perhaps the biggest aspect of the week is a dreamy square between jovial Jupiter and aquatic Neptune that peaks on Saturday. This can lead to unrealistic goals that you may have no hope of achieving.

This is a chance to make changes to your environment that may be long overdue. \r\n\r\n At the same time, prudent Saturn turns direct in a more intense zone, and this could lead to improvements regarding shared finances, business matters, and deep soul bonds. If you’ve experienced obstacles, these can begin to ease. \r\n\r\n Over this week, though, you’ll need to take care regarding schemes or plans that aren’t rooted in reality.

For the first time in the company's history, we will see them venture into new territories with a fast-paced FPS game, a card based strategy game and also a mobile version of League of Legends. They are also developing a fighting game similar to 'Mortal Kombat' which is a bold move by the gaming behemoths. On top of that, we are also treated to a new League of Legends animated series called Arcane.  This currently has no approximate release date but is planned to release in 2020.\r\n\r\nWhat is of most interest currently though is the new card strategy game called 'Legends of Runeterra.'  This will tackle 'Hearthstone' and will certainly challenge its place at the top of the card strategy genre. It is set to battle the micro transactions that has angered and frustrated Hearthstone players for years. 'League of Runeterra' will have a completely new system in which the players can buy cards directly using in-game currency.\r\n\r\n[size=small][url=https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/riots-7-new-games-are-a-declaration-of-war-against-blizzard\/]Source[\/url][\/size]\r\n\r\n[url=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h4FGqymg4k4&t=2165s][size=small]10-Year Anniversary[\/size] [\/url]\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][b][size=small]New PlayStation controllers connect using Cloud Based technology & Cross Platform support[\/size][\/b][\/color]\r\n\r\nNew patents for the new PS5 controller have led to some interesting finds. For the first time, the PS5 controller is shown to be connected through an online server rather than your PlayStation 5 console, it seems the shift to cloud gaming is soon upon us. However, this is only speculation and it might not be for the PS5 controller at all, but rather a separate controller for the new generation console believed to be used in PlayStation's 'PS Now' streaming service. Microsoft has also confirmed that Project Scarlett (Xbox new generation) will use some kind of cloud based technology, so we should definitely be excited for this new era of advancement. Sony has also confirmed the new controller will feature cutting edge \"haptic technology,\" rumored to be called 'Dual-shock 5.'\r\n\r\nSomething very exciting for console gamers is that the PS4 has finally allowed cross-play, which is a big move for Sony considering they ruled out cross-play for a long period of time.  But, with increased pressure they have now confirmed that the PS4 will join the cross-play club.  Below is a list of all games that are now cross-play compatible:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fortnite: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, mobile\r\n[*]Dauntless: PS4, Xbox One, PC\r\n[*]Rocket League: Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS4\r\n[*]SMITE: Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS4\r\n[*]Paladins: Champions of the Realm: Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS4\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Xbox One, PS4, PC (October 25th)\r\n[\/list]\r\n\r\n[size=small][url=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MrrX2leLVsA]Source[\/url][\/size]\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][b][size=small]Spectacular Nintendo Switch sales & Witcher 3\/Overwatch[\/size][\/b][\/color]\r\n\r\nThe 'Nintendo Switch' is breaking records, it has now surpassed 15 million sales in North America.  The 'Nintendo Switch' is now the best selling US video game console for 10 months in a row.  You have the choice between two models, the standard Switch which comes in at $299, or you can opt for the cheaper option and buy the Lite for $199. \r\nBoth models feature most of the same core specs, (i.e same cpu\/gpu) which means that they are both equally powerful and offer great in-game performance. The Switch Lite is also only intended as a handheld device, meaning that you cant play it the same way as the standard model. \r\n\r\n[size=small][url=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MrrX2leLVsA]Source[\/url][\/size]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wA0wwfj.png[\/img][\/align]\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][b][size=small]Beats Solo Pro[\/size][\/b][\/color]\r\n\r\nApple has just announced the Beats Solo Pro, these are the company's first on-ear noise-cancelling headphones. They feature up to 22 hours of wireless power (40 hours off), on top of that, they come in several eye popping colors, and three of the designs are created by singer Pharrell Williams. They have a transparency function which activates the external microphone so you can hear the outside world, this is particularly useful when travelling. They have now refined the drivers and lower harmonic distortion, which means clearler quality. The price of these are around $350 so they are definitely not cheap, but maybe for music lovers who enjoy a better battery life, it could be worth the purchase.\r\n\r\n[size=x-small][color=#ffffff][url=https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/beats-solo-pro]Source[\/url][\/color][\/size]\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][b][size=small]The Failure of RED's Hydrogen One[\/size][\/b][\/color]\r\n\r\nThe phone created by popular camera\/video company 'RED' was originally $1,295 at launch.  The phone was robust and built well to protect it from the environment, but the design was clunky and the camera was oversized. Now, the Hydrogen One has been dropped down to $645 which is slightly under 50% of the original price, reviewers and testers are still wondering if the price is worth it. The reason why it was considered a failed product is the fact the camera, despite being made by RED, was extremely lackluster and failed to deliver on any of its promises.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/10\/18\/20920624\/red-hydrogen-one-phone-price-drop]Source[\/url][\/size][\/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][b][size=small]U.S. Launches Cyber Attack Against Iran[\/size][\/b][\/color]\r\n\r\nTwo officials have notified the Reuters news agency that a secret cyber attack operation took place in late September.

With Mercury and Venus in an intense zone, you may become more aware of how you really feel about someone, and this could inspire you to do something if necessary.\r\n \r\nWith lively Mercury linking to dreamy Neptune on Tuesday and potent Pluto over the weekend, someone could seem almost ideal at first encounter.

Give yourself room to maneuver and you’ll feel much better.\r\n \r\nWith a focus on your sector of relating, you now have opportunities to improve a current bond, enjoy a sparkling social life, and make empowering business connections, too.\r\n \r\nBe realistic on Tuesday, though, as upbeat Mercury’s link to aquatic Neptune could see you being rather too trusting of someone. This person may be fine, but get to know them better before you commit to anything.\r\n \r\nThe weekend could see you immersed in deep conversation about the future and what you need to do to welcome positive change.

This can also be a very exciting time for romance, including possibilities for finding that special person. With both sweet Venus and chatty Mercury in passionate Scorpio, flirtations can be understated but powerfully intense. If there is someone you’ve admired from afar, you may no longer be able to hide it.\r\n \r\nA potent Mercury-Pluto tie on Saturday indicates that one conversation could encourage positive change.

If you deal with them diplomatically, it will likely blow over in a few days. If you tackle them head-on, there could be a spat, which is best avoided.\r\n \r\nAs dealmaker Mercury aligns with hazy Neptune on Tuesday, you could find it hard to focus on details, preferring to drift and dream. Are you working on a creative project? Your imagination may be strong, and this aspect can be very helpful for completing the work.\r\n \r\nThe weekend could be more intense, with key aspects encouraging you to transform your lifestyle.

Are there any that are underused? And how much are they worth on the market? The sun angles toward potent Pluto on Monday, so it’s also possible that you’ve underestimated certain talents and that now is the time to realise their true worth.\r\n \r\nWith Mercury and sweet Venus in your sector of communication, your social life could pick up and sizzle with promise. Tuesday can be excellent for a romantic date, but don’t believe everything someone tells you.\r\n \r\nThe weekend has more intense qualities, with an in-depth conversation encouraging some positive decisions and inspiring you to take up new opportunities.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n \r\n[b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You could make a decision early in the week that impacts the family or your home. Have you had enough of someone’s attitude? Now is the time to stand your ground and say what you really think. They might be surprised, but perhaps they had it coming.\r\n \r\nAs the sun and dynamic Mars continue to move through your sign, you find the courage to focus on those plans that are personal to you. It’s time to do what you want regardless of what others might think.\r\n \r\nYou could be feeling very generous on Tuesday and inclined to give away your time and money for free. But are you doing the right thing? It might be that without your input a certain person would be more inclined to manage on their own.\r\n \r\nYou could be looking for the perfect item for your home over the weekend, no matter how much it costs. A resourceful Mercury-Pluto tie hints that with some research you could find a bargain.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n \r\n[b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You continue to be in a quieter phase, with the sun and warrior Mars currently journeying through your spiritual zone. On Monday, though, you might realize how a past experience is continuing to affect you now. This can be an opportunity to talk things over with a trusted confidant and find a way to heal and resolve the issue.\r\n \r\nWith articulate Mercury and luscious Venus in your sign, this is very much a time to reach out to others, expand your social circle, and share your ideas and opinions.\r\n \r\nTuesday could be very creative day when your imagination peaks. If you have the urge to produce something beautiful, go with it. You could feel positively recharged as a result.\r\n \r\nThe weekend could find you in detective mode and eager to resolve issues that have bugged you for some time. You may also enjoy thrillers and suspense novels and movies as a way to wind down.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n \r\n[b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Your social life seems to be on a roll, and you could be very proactive about mixing with people on your wavelength. But you might also need to make decisions about how much time you spend with friends and how much time you spend on important plans and goals. Getting the balance right can be difficult, but because this is a time of opportunity for you, you won’t want to miss out.\r\n \r\nTuesday could bring creative and imaginative ideas into the mix, and you may find that channeling them into artwork or beautifying your home can be positive. The ideas might be linked to your spiritual ideals, and bringing them into your domestic setting could create a very positive atmosphere.\r\n \r\nWith both lively Mercury and lovely Venus in your spiritual sector, you may enjoy mixing with people who are on your same spiritual path. Any events you attend could have a positive impact on you.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=9]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n \r\n[b][color=#663333]Capricorn ♑[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You may feel someone in authority needs to change, but perhaps you are the one who needs to be more flexible. If you can’t agree on a key issue, trying to force things to go your way could make matters worse. As the aspect on Monday is temporary, it might be wise not to rock the boat. See how you feel about things in a few days. You may find your perspective changes quite dramatically.\r\n \r\nHowever, Tuesday could see you in a dreamier mood and very sensitive to the subtleties of life as logical Mercury aligns with ethereal Neptune. Practical matters may not hold much appeal, but anything creative or romantic will. You might also be drawn to art exhibitions, which could be very enjoyable.\r\n \r\nSaturday could see you trying hard to figure out a key issue, and with a very intense transit in the cards, it seems likely you will succeed.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=10]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n \r\n[b][color=#9966ff]Aquarius ♒[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"What is stopping you from embracing a new opportunity? Could it be past experiences? The sun’s edgy angle with volcanic Pluto on Monday could draw your attention to this matter. This can be a chance to discuss things with a life coach who can help you move beyond your limits and fulfill your potential.\r\n \r\nGo easy with your money on Tuesday because you could have a tendency to splurge regardless of whether you can afford it or not. And rather than spend it on yourself, your generosity may be directed to others. You might have a very noble desire to make them happy, but it helps to be practical as well.\r\n \r\nTrust your instincts over the weekend when chatty Mercury aligns with potent Pluto. If you get an urge to call someone or visit a place, do so. It could be important to you.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=11]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n \r\n[b][color=#cccc66]Pisces ♓[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"With dynamic Mars and the sun moving through your sector of shared assets and business, the coming week could see you making some key decisions. You can go far this time if you avoid overthinking certain matters and just sort things out. A friend may have a very different opinion on what you should do, but only listen to them if you feel they have a valid point.\r\n \r\nYou may yearn to visit a place that holds special memories for you, particularly on Tuesday. If it’s a beautiful place, going there might act as a restorative and help you relax. It could be a very healing experience.\r\n \r\nThe weekend could be quite intense in a positive way. Conversations could lead to you make plans for a trip that ends up being life changing in some way. And a business connection could show signs of developing into a supportive friendship.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n[\/align]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OS0BBVp.png[\/img][\/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https:\/\/i.gyazo.com\/2bee876332952a0b39939a8c799713c2.png[\/img]\r\n[img]https:\/\/i.gyazo.com\/a647b96d473dd09e869b45c92bfa0047.png[\/img][\/align]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3QVosbu.png[\/img][color=#000000]-[\/color]\r\n[url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][b]Sir[\/b][\/url]\r\n[url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=2890436][color=#ff3333][b]Pikachu[\/b][\/color][\/url]\r\n[url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=4219906][b]duplex[\/b][\/url][\/align]","subject":"Hack Forums News \/\/ Unofficial Edition \/\/ October 18, 2019","tags":"Hack,Forums,News,Unofficial,HF,445,Writ3rs,Sir,Pikachu,duplex","dateline":"1571426896","approval_dateline":"1571506958"},

It has registered the highest budget deficit ever recorded in the past seven years. Offsetting of tax receipts has been evidenced by the rapidly growing debt service payments. It has also been contributed by acts of higher spending. The deficit which stands at $984 billion is a reflection of a second full budget since Donald Trump got into power. These figures have been registered at a time when the country has been expanding its tax base.

Michael \"Shroud\" Grzsesiek joining Mixer will definitely be a huge blow to Twitch, currently Shroud's Mixer has over 25,000 followers already with the number estimated to be much higher very quickly. On the Twitch platform, he has over 6.5 million followers and is one of Twitch's top streamers of all time, this certainly shows how much Microsoft wants to expand into the ever growing video streaming scene. Earlier this year, we saw Ninja start the revolution by announcing he was leaving Amazon's Twitch for a lucrative and also beneficial deal with Mixer, it now seems they have managed to take Twitch's two most popular streamers, and seek to expand Mixer's audience by a huge margin. According to Ninja, who is famed for his Fortnite streams, he claims that Twitch has a lot of restrictive rules about advertising on other platforms other than Twitch. Shroud has now over 1,855,458 viewers already, and from the time of writing this thread, is hosting his first ever Mixer stream. https:\/\/mixer.com\/shroud [i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/uk\/shroud-moves-to-mixer\/]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i] \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Ubisoft sues Rainbow Six Siege cheat maker[\/color][\/b]\r\nGaming giant Ubisoft has filled a lawsuit against a company called MizuSoft, a company who have developed cheating software for their online games. The filed lawsuit that Ubisoft claims MizuSoft earned thousands of dollars every month by selling specialized   Rainbow Six Siege cheating software. This software wasn't cheap, they offered the premium cheats for $13 per day or $77 per month, however the high price didn't stop thousands of users download the software and pay the fee required. The cheat maker reported that the cheat rakes in a sum of nearly $1926 per week, that is frankly astounding despite the circumstance. Now MizuSoft has reportedly taken down their site as it seems that things won't end well for the cheat making company.

One of the main problems that plagued Fallout 76 was the disconnects from playing, this happend a lot and has disgruntled gamers all over the globe, speaking truthfully, the servers are notoriously bad. However, Fallout now has a $100 per year subscription plan which offers you private servers. A new premium service subscription called Fallout 1st is now available to buy and it includes access to private servers which Bethesda calls \"private worlds\" that you and your friends can play on. While this may be a good idea to those willing to pay for the subscription, it is very expensive for just hosting your own servers and playing with your friends privately and it should be expected that this service isn't going to be hugely popular, even for the die hard Fallout fans.[i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/fallout-76s-new-100-per-year-subscription-plan-off\/1100-6470807\/]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=2605759][img]https:\/\/hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/animenews-houtarou.png[\/img][\/url][\/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]OOPS!

The regulations had been initially set to prevent moving of American companies abroad, thus resulting in their tax bill reduction. Trump officials have declared that the regulations are not important anymore. Changes made to overhaul tax by Trump are said to help in preventing inversions. Although the move has been initiated, some Democrats have criticized it. They have argued that the weakening of rules that were set during the administration of Obama will create a tax evasion channel for corporations.  [i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/10\/31\/business\/trump-treasury-corporate-inversions.html]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Why Brazil may fail to Lure Low Cost Airlines[\/color][\/b]\r\nThere have been attempts by the government officials from Brazil to tempt the executives. The officials wanted the Latin America, which is one of the largest domestic aviation markets to open up. The promises set include luring low cost carries into making domestic flights. The number of passengers operating in the skies of Brazil are to be numbered just like the infrastructure minister promised. The Petrobras, which are controlled by the government and acts as a jet monopoly fuel, is to come to an end. A fee of $18, which is charged on every flight, is to be dropped.

Interestingly, Overwatch 2 has now been announced and it will feature co-op missions, new multiplayer system and also more heroes. I would like to note that there is now gameplay for Overwatch 2 featured on YouTube. One that I was most excited for is the long awaited Diablo 4, recently Blizzard have faced backlash over a lack of AAA games from the company which saw Blizzard release more card games which worked well with micro-transactions. Diablo 4 will be bloodier, scarier and full of even more twisted enemies you can slay, although Diablo 4 has a non-linear campaign in which you can explore in your own time, Blizzard has also stated that Diablo 4 will be more like Diablo 2, which follows a lot about satanic rituals and occult symbols.

It is set to cost $129.00 in the US and £119 in the UK. Google has announced that November 19th will be the day that the Stadia will be available to purchase. I will say that the price is very decent when factoring that it is a founders edition which includes a limited edition Night Blue controller worth $69, a Chromecast Ultra and a three month subscription to Stadia Pro. It is available to pre-order as of this moment, so if you are interested in Cloud Gaming, you can reserve your copy now. Google has stated that you would need a minimum of 30 mbps internet to be able to play games at 4K resolution.

However, it was a PS4 exclusive which meant you would need to buy or own a PS4 to play. Thankfully this is the case no longer, Death Stranding is eventually coming to PC. The rumored date of release is early summer 2020, which isn't far away. The PS4 version will be available on the 8th of November. We will be likely seeing a higher FPS option and greatly improved graphics to the console version, although PC gamers since the announcement have asked if the PC version has any new tricks up its sleeve.[i][size=x-small][url=https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/uk\/death-stranding-pc-release-date\/]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n       \r\n[\/size][\/font]\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=2605759][img]https:\/\/hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/animenews-houtarou.png[\/img][\/url][\/align]\r\n[font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Shirobako Anime Film to be Released in Japan in February 2020[\/color][\/b]\r\nThe upcoming [i]SHIROBAKO[\/i] movie that has been in confirmed production for more than two years now, finally announced a release date.

Mike Maslowski, a retired salesman, is a conservative retiree who is cautious about his spending and that of his family to maintain a comfortable life. Expenses should offer the required contentment without sacrificing such important issues like the health of the individual. It is also important to invest the savings to earn more and minimize the risks encountered in retirement. The recommended withdrawal rate is 4 percent of their savings annually, which is currently not adhered to by the majority of American retirees.

[i]Aniplex[\/i] bailed from production after last Fall's film side-story under-performed, leaving the season to be inevitably picked up by [i]Studio Deen[\/i] who, while now having taken over the primary \"production\" role, has outsourced the majority of the work to [i]March Jack[\/i]¹. This led fans to almost expect the season to be a train-wreck, though some additional unexpected issues have arisen since the first episode originally aired². Once a series well known for its blood and gore, [i]The Seven Deadly Sins: Wrath of the Gods[\/i] has decided to drop that entirely: opting to lazily cover any significant injury or body part with a black shadow and whiting out blood in its entirety. Animation in the opening is almost non-existent, with most of the sequence containing stills. Non-existing animation has been a reoccurring complaint as episodes are released week by week. The recent episode five left fans again wondering, as a series of extended frames had Meliodas's facial proportions completely off, not to mention a general lack of attention to detail³. It may be too early to [i]officially[\/i] call this season of [i]The Seven Deadly Sins[\/i] a bust, but things definitely aren't looking up.

With dynamic Mars in the last degrees of your sector of relating, this can be a time to resolve any partnership or relationship issues before your focus shifts next week. \r\n\r\nThe emphasis is still very much on shared assets and business matters, as well as deep soul bonds. And with talkative Mercury rewinding in this zone, it’s necessary that you exercise caution when dealing with large amounts of money or sensitive issues. Things may seem clear-cut on the surface, but perhaps they aren’t as they appear. \r\n\r\nTuesday’s full moon across your financial axis might encourage you to splurge or indulge in other ways. If tempted to do so, ask yourself what you really need, and feel the answer in your heart chakra. This is where you will likely find satisfaction. In general, avoid rushing into anything. Take your time.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"You may have a few questions about key business or romance relationships this week. However, the answers may not give you as much clarity as you’d like. Much as you try to pinpoint the source of the issue, it could shift and change, leaving you none the wiser.\r\n\r\nThe full moon in your sign on Tuesday could amp up the feelings in a key relationship. If you’re newly in love, this essential aspect could encourage you to take things to the next level. Feelings might override logic, though, so be sure this is the right way forward for you. If you try to hold on to someone, they may take several steps back. \r\n\r\nThere is the potential for ideas and decisions to shift and change as an aspect involving nebulous Neptune and Mercury retrograde comes to the fore. Still, an adventurous Mars-Jupiter tie could see you eager to pool resources with someone in a business venture.

However, with the planets spread across other sectors, you’ll also be busy with your everyday routines, key relationships, and financial and business affairs. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, there is a full moon in a more spiritual sector, so it might be wise to lighten your schedule if you can. A full moon can bring on some drama and heightened feelings, which could make for an edgy day. It might help if you can take a step back. \r\n\r\nWith convivial Mercury continuing its retrograde phase, though, it pays to be extra careful at work, particularly because this unpredictable planet aligns with ethereal Neptune midweek. This isn’t the best time to sign agreements or contracts because things may not be quite as they seem.

Be prepared for a detour. \r\n\r\nTuesday’s full moon across your social axis can be perfect for a fun get-together or perhaps a bigger occasion. And with this full moon taking place in sensual Taurus, it can be an opportunity to indulge. Are you eager to take a romance further? You might find it hard to resist doing so. You could also be mesmerized by someone and perhaps find it hard to get them out of your mind. However, current aspects suggest getting to know the person better before you get too involved. \r\n\r\nStill, a link between the sun and volcanic Pluto can be an opportunity to team up with someone who shares the same passions as you.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"Monday’s merger of the sun and retrograde Mercury in your domestic sector could see you reminiscing about aspects of the past. You could find a recipe book that belonged to a family member from long ago and be eager to try some of their ideas. Or perhaps an object or old letter brings up sentimental feelings. \r\n\r\nWhile the focus on your domestic sector looks set to continue over the coming weeks, Tuesday’s full moon could highlight your personal goals and aspirations. This can be an opportunity to bask in the spotlight concerning something recently accomplished. \r\n\r\nPlus, an adventurous Mars-Jupiter tie could be an opportunity to connect with someone regarding a creative idea or other enterprise. You may relish a challenge even if it means taking a leap of faith. \r\n\r\nGo easy on the romance front, though, as a dreamy Venus-Neptune link suggests someone could take advantage of you by encouraging feelings of guilt.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=5]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#339933]Virgo ♍[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"With both the sun and dealmaker Mercury in your communication zone, you may be busy with ideas and eager to involve others in exciting discussions.

Such influences can be perfect for brainstorming, but with the likelihood of misunderstandings and confusion, it might be unwise to arrange anything that involves a lot of money or is crucial in some other way. \r\n\r\nThe Tuesday Taurus full moon in your sector of travel and adventure could see you yearning for new opportunities or a trip. If something appeals to you, you might think nothing of booking it. The break could do you good. \r\n\r\nAs fiery Mars aligns with jovial Jupiter this week, you may be eager to purchase items that can add a point of interest to your home, as well as amuse and entertain.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"As feisty Mars navigates the last degrees of your sign, this is the time to deal with issues that need to be sorted out. Don’t delay, because you may not be so eager to do it next week when Mars moves into Scorpio. \r\n\r\nEven so, money matters need a lot more care than usual as logical Mercury continues retrograde in this sector. And with a full moon on Tuesday across your financial axis, the urge to splurge could be stronger, too. Try to steer clear of big-ticket items like computers, cars, or entertainment systems, because the deal could go wrong. If you do make a purchase, keep the receipts and paperwork in case there’s a problem. \r\n\r\nThat said, if you want to buy a loved one a special gift to show your affection, it will be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFinally, with luscious Venus, your ruler, in cahoots with dreamy Neptune on Thursday, someone could sweet-talk you into accepting something that isn’t all that good for you.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"There is still time to find closure on issues that may be having an emotional impact.

With thoughtful Mercury continuing to rewind in your sign, this can be a good time to resolve such matters. However, with dreamy Neptune in the mix, clarity is essential. It would be easy for confusion and misunderstandings to complicate matters. \r\n\r\nWith a full moon in your sector of relating intensifying feelings around Tuesday, it’s also possible that things could come to a head regarding other relationship issues. Are you ready to tell someone how you feel? It could all come out in a rush, especially if you’ve been holding back. \r\n\r\nStill, with the sun linking to potent Pluto, the days ahead can see you making a firm decision and sticking to it.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"With the radiant sun in a more secluded sector along with logical Mercury, this is very much a time to step back from life and consider your priorities.

These are some of the things to consider over the coming weeks. \r\n\r\nWith lively Mercury, your relationship planet, rewinding in your spiritual zone, it wouldn’t be surprising if you met someone from the past. In fact, it could seem positively karmic. \r\n\r\nThe desire to indulge in fantasies could also be strong now, and with a powerful full moon in your lifestyle sector, feelings could get out of hand. If you can lighten your schedule around Tuesday, it will help you more easily navigate through this time. \r\n\r\nFinally, with feisty Mars angling toward expansive Jupiter midweek, a social event could bring a wonderful opportunity your way.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=9]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#663333]Capricorn ♑[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"While you may still be busy with goals, ambitions, and career matters, this can be a good time to tie up loose ends in this regard.

Next week, you could be more distracted and not so inclined to get organized. \r\n\r\nThe focus on your social sector could inspire you to reach out and connect with those who share your ideas and passions. And with chatty Mercury in its retrograde phase, there is also the possibility of linking with someone from the past. Whether you deliberately organize a reunion or it happens by itself, this can be a great opportunity to reconnect. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, there is a full moon across your social axis that could intensify feelings. This can be great for a social occasion, as well as a special outing or date.

However, as they could be amplified at this time, it isn’t a good idea to make any key decisions. Some drama on the home front could detract from certain responsibilities, so if you can lighten your schedule, do so. \r\n\r\nMidweek, a feisty aspect involving dynamic Mars and jovial Jupiter could coincide with the opportunity for a group outing that proves very worthwhile.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=11]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#cccc66]Pisces ♓[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"While this is very much a time to explore new opportunities, it helps to understand your motives for doing so.

As chatty Mercury in its retrograde phase angles toward spiritual Neptune, you could be caught up in dreams or fantasies that might not materialize. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, if someone offers you a sound proposition with some substance, you might not take it. Before making any key decisions, consider talking to a practical and trusted friend who may be able to give you some solid advice. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the full moon across your communication axis can be an emotional one. If there is something you need to talk about, doing so might allow you to shed a few tears, which could be very healing. \r\n\r\nThe message this week is to keep your feet on the ground as you aim for the stars.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n[\/list][font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Alan Watts \"The Real You\"[\/color][\/b]\r\n[video=youtube]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I[\/video]\r\n\r\n         \r\n[\/size][\/font]\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=2331053][img]https:\/\/hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/comics-mix.png[\/img][\/url][\/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center]\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 1 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/a7\/d0\/40\/a7d04077c6136669bf20faeb08dc8062.gif[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 2 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/static.boredpanda.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/funny-the-square-comics-alvin-juan-fb9__700-png.jpg[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 3 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/memecell.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Top-15-Funny-Comics-Hilarious-for-Today-14.jpg?fit=564%2C1128&ssl=1[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 4 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/20\/d7\/95\/20d7956a1ea823f51357cafd861abf2b.gif[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 5 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/a9\/0a\/a8\/a90aa8509d6f572af94b008a0b0df3e3.jpg[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 6 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/yogaretreats.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Only-True-Masters-Of-Yoga-Can-Get-To-That-Point-800x285.jpg[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 7 -[\/size][\/b][sp=][img]https:\/\/lefunny.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Men-are-Men.jpg[\/img][\/sp]\r\n\r\n[\/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/HFWrit3rs][img]https:\/\/www.hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/twitter.png[\/img][\/url]\r\n[url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/HFWrit3rs][b]Follow us on Twitter and get hot Hack Forums news straight to your phone in a timely manner![\/b][\/url][\/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n       ","subject":"Hack Forums News \/\/ Edition 448","tags":"HF News","dateline":"1573615976","approval_dateline":"1574443955"},

While Mr. Trump mentioned the positives of the tough trade policies to the American people, he failed to mention any of the negatives. Beijing commented on this and stated that one of the things that they would expect in order to end the trade war between the two countries is lowered tariffs.

Trump wavered over wether the tariffs in the ongoing trade war with China will be rolled back. The president had told reporters that the U.S government had not yet agreed to lift the tariffs. This contrasted what a spokesman for the Chinese military had said earlier that week. The Chinese Official had said that the two governments had indeed agreed to lift the tariffs. The NASDAQ however gained value on the back of the increase in share price of Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc. Nonetheless, the S&P 500 was on track for its fifth straight week of growth and the Nasdaq was on tack for a sixth week of growth.

The Trump administration in liaison with the Chinese government has been in discussion to come up with a palatable agreement that will benefit both nations. The trade wars have seen tariffs being raised for goods in both countries. The share index for top registered big 500 fortune companies increased by 0.9 percent. Among the best performers are the health-care stocks, Boeing and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).

If you don’t mind one way or the other, then tell it like it is.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been on the receiving end of mixed messages or misunderstandings, things can begin to change as talkative Mercury turns direct midweek. You’ll have an opportunity to finalize any deals or agreements you’ve been working on, too. Give yourself a week or so, though, so that Mercury can get back on track.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to get rid of those skeletons in the closet? The sun’s move into Sagittarius and a more intense zone on Friday could see you ready to do some emotional housecleaning.\r\n\r\nThis weekend, you might be in an independent mood and eager to do your own thing.

Try to pace yourself, Gemini, particularly as the week gathers pace. As Mars moves to oppose electric Uranus over the weekend, a restless streak could see you taking shortcuts that might backfire.\r\n\r\nThe good news this week is that Mercury, your personal planet, turns direct midweek after its retrograde phase, which could make life easier. As it gets back on track, there should be fewer delays and less likelihood of misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nThe sun glides into your relationship zone on Friday, and you could benefit from some insights into your closest bonds.

If so, with flirtatious Mercury in your romance sector pushing ahead midweek, things can begin to improve. Allow this to occur naturally, though.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the radiant sun in your lifestyle zone on Friday can give you a boost, and it may bring insights into what is working and what isn’t. This can be a chance to streamline your affairs and get back on track with your wellness routine.\r\n\r\nGo easy over the weekend, though, because a clash of perspectives could cause a rift.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"With fiery Mars moving into your domestic sector this week, you’ll be ready to get your place in order.

This planet turns direct on Wednesday, which means a gradual end to any frustrations and delays.\r\n\r\nReady for some fun? As the fiery sun moves into your leisure zone, you might be more inclined to get out and about. Romantic and creative opportunities await you, but most of all, you might feel like doing something adventurous.\r\n\r\nThe weekend could bring unexpected demands or responsibilities your way.

Fiery Mars opposes maverick Uranus over the days ahead, so you might prefer to stand your ground rather than give an inch.\r\n\r\nThoughtful Mercury, your guide planet, turns direct in your communication zone midweek, which could see a turnaround in your affairs. Deals that were held up may now begin to show signs of movement.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also benefit from the movement of the sun into your home zone, where it will stay for four weeks.

If you want to earn more cash, this is certainly the time to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve experienced delays in receiving funds, things can begin to move forward this week as dealmaker Mercury turns direct.

Also consider hiring the services of a life coach or teacher who can help you make the most of your life and overall potential.\r\n\r\nHas life been frustrating?

Kelly discussed how, at the moment, Bitcoin is not used as a payment form in a significant way and is like a \"digital gold.\" He also mentioned that the company's \"strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials.\" This would lead to increased access to cryptocurrency for the average consumer. People would be able to more easily purchase and use cryptos. He continued by talking about the possibility of being able to \"cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally,\" enabling payments using a coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum where they are not usually an option. It has been possible for some time to have a card that allows you to pay with Bitcoin, among other currencies. Companies have worked with providers like Mastercard to bring the service to crypto advocates.

It rose from about 28 cents to 72 cents, at its peak. What was the cause of this, you might ask? A poorly organized pump and dump. In the past, groups have orchestrated large buys of a specific coin to rapidly increase its price. People then sold the coin as the price increased and it proceeded to crash back down. The problem with this is that there has to be losers in order for there to be winners. The amount of of profit that some people make will be similar to the amount of money that other people lose. A Telegram group with over 100,000 members planned a pump of XRP. The group named itself \"BUY & HOLD XRP FEB 1ST, 2021 @8:30AM EST.\" As you might expect, that isn't exactly what happened. People purchased the coin in the run up to February 1, instead of everyone buying it at the same time. In the hours before 08:30 AM EST, people began to sell. The coin's value almost halved in the space of a few hours.

The company's CEO, Elon Musk, had been promoting Bitcoin and Dogecoin on his personal Twitter account for some time, and this move should come as no surprise if you take that into account. According to Tesla, the investment was done as part of an aim to \"diversify and maximize returns on our cash\" and was revealed in their annual report. This is in reference to cash that is not a necessity to \"maintain [an] adequate operating liquidity.\" The company hopes to start accepting orders that use Bitcoin as a payment method in the near future as well. Following the news, the price for Bitcoin jumped by over $4,000 within an hour. Throughout 2020, many companies invested in cryptocurrencies as an alternative way to generate an income during the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla joined them with one of the largest investments in crypto made by a company, paving the way for other large corporations to do so.

Dream big, Pisces!\r\n\r\nHowever, a small setback could occur when Venus in Aquarius squares Mars in Taurus on Friday, creating a struggle around how you feel. When you merely need some privacy and space, you could come across as cold and aloof to loved ones.\r\n\r\nNo worries, because Mercury goes direct in Aquarius on Saturday. Mercury moves forward in your sector of privacy, making it easier to express your emotional needs and ask for help. You’ll be able to better understand your subconscious feelings, especially if you’ve been acting out recently.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n[\/list]\r\n\r\n[align=center][font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium][color=#C3FFFF]Hope everyone had a great valentines day!

They are able to issue onshore licenses that are by the book and governed by the regulations of the Trakhees Authority. Trakhees is the regulatory division of the Ports, Customs, and Free Zone Corporation; they handle regulating and licensing businesses in special development areas. In addition to paying for trade licenses, clients are able to lease office space aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) ocean liner. KIKLABB intends to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether (USDT) as payment methods. While BTC and ETH can be highly volatile, USDT is a stablecoin and is supposed to be pegged to the United States Dollar.  This can add some security for clients wishing to use cryptocurrencies while paying with a stable option. The entity stated that \"customers can register as well as pay for Dubai trade licenses remotely and with a virtual currency, using just their smartphone.\" They are eliminating the need for face-to-face meetings with cash and credit cards and instead allow customers to turn to an online world where people can manage their trade license anywhere and everywhere with their digital currencies.

There has been an issue with stocking the new RTX cards and, well, that is thanks to cryptocurrency miners. Ethereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies and many miners opt for the latest and greatest cards to improve their mining rigs. In order to prevent shortages, the company is reducing the efficiency of mining Ethereum on its latest card by 50%. This move is to ensure that the company's products \"end up in the hands of gamers\" instead of miners that are looking to create mini mining farms. So far, this will only affect the RTX 3060 through the card's software.

Mars in Taurus trines Pluto in Capricorn, allowing you an opportunity to bond with someone. Take a small step toward intimacy, Libra.\r\n\r\nYour love life and finances may become a bit more reliable, starting when Venus enters Pisces on Thursday. Your ruling planet will be in your sector of routines for the next couple of weeks, making life more imaginative but also less practical. Be careful when it comes to money and losing your heart.\r\n\r\nFocus on self-care and inner reflection when the full moon is in Virgo and your sector of privacy on Saturday. If you’ve been working on healing over the last few months, prepare to see some results. However, if you’ve been a bit self-destructive recently, you could see the consequences of that as well.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"It’s all about making connections this week, starting on Wednesday.

This is a good day to network and get a handle on some of your more ambitious goals.\r\n\r\nHowever, don’t get so busy with work that you forget to have a little fun. On Thursday, Venus enters Pisces and your sector of pleasure. For the next few weeks, your imagination will get a big boost, and you’ll be encouraged to express your creativity in artistic ways.\r\n\r\nThe week ends on a fun note when the full moon is in Virgo and your sector of friendship on Saturday. This is a great day to hang out with a couple of close friends. Kick back and have some fun, Scorpio.

Small steps you take today can lead to big rewards later.\r\n\r\nThe winter blues may start to get to you when Venus enters Pisces on Thursday. Venus will be in your family sector for the next few weeks, turning you into a big, old homebody. As you stay at home, start redecorating or do some online shopping. Remember, you can make your home beautiful without blowing your budget.\r\n\r\nKeep your ego in check when the full moon is in Virgo on Saturday.

Pour this passion into doing something that makes you feel excited.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Venus enters dreamy Pisces. While you’re not an “emotional” sign, Venus in your sector of communication makes it easier to tell people how you feel. Let your imagination run wild as you get inspired by everything. While this can be a romantic time, don’t completely lose your head.\r\n\r\nAdventure awaits you when the full moon is in Virgo on Saturday, making you ready for discovery and knowledge. The moon in your sector of philosophy highlights everything you’ve learned over the last few months. Don’t dwell on mistakes, but learn from them and grow.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=10]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#9966ff]Aquarius ♒[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"After a busy month, things are beginning to slow down for you.

With Venus now in your sector of value, you start feeling more generous and unselfishly give your personal resources to others. While this brings out the humanitarian in you, don’t give all of yourself away, especially to people who may not appreciate it. Stay logical.\r\n\r\nFinally, the full moon in Virgo brings transformations on Saturday. The moon in your sector of intimacy allows you opportunities to develop stronger bonds with others and let go of the past.\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=11]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#cccc66]Pisces ♓[\/color][\/b]\r\n[i]\"As more planets enter your sign, use your power to get what you desire when Mars in Taurus trines Pluto in Capricorn on Wednesday.

Venus is exalted in Pisces, making it extra powerful. This could lead to new beginnings for you when it comes to love and romance. Your dream partner or your dream life just might materialize during this gentle and affectionate time for you.\r\n\r\nThe romance only intensifies when the full moon is in Virgo and your sector of partnerships on Saturday. If you’ve had a prolonged crush, this could be when you finally seal the deal.

Over the course of four years, researchers discovered those with poor sleep hygiene were two times more likely to not perform as well as their counterparts. Data also tells us male insomniacs are three times more likely to receive a disability pension. To combat insomnia and poor performance in the workplace, researchers suggest “a healthy lifestyle, get enough sleep, and work hours that suit their chronotype.” Evidence reports that incorporating these concepts into your routine will increase your quality of life.

With the assistance of new software, data suggests that water is present while planets are being formed. Combined with a theory named ‘pebble accretion’, which states “planets are formed by pebbles that are clumping together” means that the possibility of other planets with conditions that can support life in the Milky Way galaxy has increased dramatically. Researchers are also excited about new telescopes using special technology, which will allow observers to determine how much water is on a planet.

The effects of global warming can be seen all over the planet, and it is very alarming. New information suggests warmer temperatures enabled bats and other creatures that carry viruses to migrate closer to human populations. This development created an opportunity for many different viruses to mutate and also increased the risk of viruses crossing between species. One researcher stated, \"The fact that climate change can accelerate the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans should be an urgent wake-up call to reduce global emissions.\" With this new data, researchers hope that government officials will see the impact of the greenhouse effect and begin to draft plans that will drastically reduce our carbon footprint.

It is important to state that it is not known whether this claim is correct or not. Throughout the start of 2021, Musk has been using his Twitter to effectively pump and dump cryptocurrencies. Both Dogecoin and Bitcoin have been affected at one point or another. It is his relationship with Dogecoin that is supposedly the source of an investigation. As cryptocurrencies are not recognized as securities, it makes one question why the Securities and Exchange Commission would even take an interest. It could be a continuation of when they filed a lawsuit against him in 2018, where they alleged that Musk was making \"a series of false and misleading statements\" about Tesla and its stock. Musk has tweeted many times about Doge, helping to fuel its drastic increase in price at the end of January, 2021. In mid-February, Musk mentioned Bitcoin, similar to how he spoke about Dogecoin, except this time he said that \"BTC & ETH do seem high lol.\" The price of Bitcoin then proceeded to plummet 10%. This led many people to accuse Musk of knowingly tweeting things that would affect the price of cryptocurrencies, claiming that he was playing with the price of them.

The move allows customers on AWS to easily create and deploy Ethereum nodes that are able to fully connect to the main Ethereum network, as well as the test networks. Through the Amazon Managed Blockchain service, it is easy to keep track of node health and performance, ensuring that blockchain applications experience near to no downtime. Ethereum upgrades and updates are handled automatically and unhealthy nodes get replaced on the go. One of the primary goals of AWS is to provide customers with an easy way to create scalable products. This mission continues with this announcement as there is the option for automated scaling to meet the demands of an application's userbase. <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/about-aws\/whats-new\/2021\/03\/announcing-general-availability-of-ethereum-on-amazon-managed-blockchain\/\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">>>Source<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold;\">Iran Could use Bitcoin to get Around Sanctions<\/span>\r\nIran is looking to adopt Bitcoin and move to a more crypto-friendly atmosphere as a result of international sanctions. The Iranian Presidential Center for Strategic Studies released a report that suggests the country could get around sanctions by using digital currency. Coins like Bitcoin are less traceable than traditional fiat currencies and can be utilised to essentially outsmart sanctions while generating millions of dollars a day from mining. This means that the country could have a somewhat untraceable source of funds. <a href=\"https:\/\/finbold.com\/iran-officially-plans-to-adopt-bitcoin-mining-to-bypass-international-sanctions\/\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">>>Source<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold;\">Kentucky is Looking to Attract Miners<\/span>\r\nKentucky is making space for Bitcoin miners.

The bill received approval in the lower house and removes the 6% sales tax on power consumption for 4 years. Between July 2021 and June 2025, miners would be able to see a higher profit and lower costs.

Unlike other species, humans are not affected by “Nepetalactone”. The hope is that countries battling disease-carrying insects can use this information to decrease deaths and other risk factors. Experiments are still being conducted and in the future stronger and environmentally safe repellents may be based on the foundation of this study.

The source of the problem was “large drones are usually powered by motors, but motors lose efficiency as you shrink them.” Makers of the drones were able to circumvent this by utilizing “actuators” that allow the drones to flap at a very high rate of speed. This will assist the drone if it bumps into a foreign object. The creators hope that first responders and farmers will be able to benefit from this technology.

Until now it wasn’t possible due to interference. Researchers said, \"chemical signatures known as absorption lines were the ideal candidates, but there was no single line that revealed the temperature alone. However, by looking at the ratio of two different but related lines -- those of iron -- we found the ratio itself related to temperature. And it did so in a consistent and predictable way.\" Gathering more data on red supergiants is important due to the nature of type II supernovas, which are responsible for distributing the necessary elements for life throughout the universe. At this time there is no way to predict when a supernova will occur, however, researchers are hopeful that this method will be used to accurately predict when one will occur in the future.

A new opportunity could present itself to you, but before you decide, do a vibe check. Was your first impression good or bad?\r\n\r\nFinally, your love life also gets a boost when Venus conjoins Neptune in your sign on Saturday. If you’re single, you might discover the partner of your dreams. If you’re already in a relationship, you may find the old spark is back as your partner becomes more tender and sincere. Enjoy it, Pisces!\"[\/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https:\/\/www.horoscope.com\/us\/horoscopes\/general\/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[\/url][\/size][\/i]\r\n[\/list]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https:\/\/iamfearlesssoul.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/spiritual-quotes-8.jpg[\/img][\/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center][font=Trebuchet MS][size=medium][url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/HFWrit3rs][img]https:\/\/www.hackforums.news\/assets\/v4\/twitter.png[\/img][\/url]\r\n[url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/HFWrit3rs][b]Follow us on Twitter and get hot Hack Forums news straight to your phone in a timely manner![\/b][\/url][\/size][\/font][\/align]","subject":"Hack Forums News \/\/ Edition 495","tags":"HF News,Hack Forums News,HFN,495","dateline":"1615236199","approval_dateline":"1615236778"},

This follows on from the explosive growth to $50,000 in February. As the cryptocurrency is going more mainstream each week, it was revealed that Bitcoin is searched twice as much as Covid-19. That may come as a shock to many people but, with all the recent news, it is not actually that surprising. While Alex Jones, the notorious conspiracy theorist, reportedly lost a laptop with over $500 million worth of BTC on it, the French government is moving to auction off $34.5 million worth of Bitcoin that was seized in 2019. Many people pointed out the hypocrisy in this. The French government had previously claimed that Bitcoin is only used for criminal activity, yet they intend to sell it themselves. Meitu Inc, on the other hand, purchased 379 BTC for roughly $18 million while MicroStategy purchased another $15 million worth of Bitcoin. <a href=\"https:\/\/tokenist.com\/google-trends-bitcoin-is-now-searched-twice-as-much-as-covid-19\/\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source 1,<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/u.today\/infowars-alex-jones-lost-laptop-with-560-million-worth-of-bitcoin\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">2,<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/61124\/french-government-to-auction-seized-bitcoin-worth-34-5-million\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">3,<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/lzp89n\/meitu_inc_a_hong_kong_stock_exchange_traded\/\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">4,<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microstrategy.com\/en\/investor-relations\/financial-documents\/microstrategy-acquires-additional-15m-in-bitcoin-at-average-price-of-57-146_03-12-2021\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">5<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><br><span style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold;\">Atari's Crypto Casino<\/span> <br>Atari is known for playing a role in popularizing video games between 1970 and 2000.

Atari has revealed that, in partnership with Decentral Games, they are launching an online casino. You might assume that it would be similar to other gambling websites. Well, that is not the case. The casino will be inside Decentrland, a virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain. For adults, the casino will be somewhat of a throwback, taking them back to some of their favorite childhood games. Players will be able use the official currency of Decentraland (MANA), DAI, and the casino's own token (ATRI).

Armed with new evidence it is clear to see the changes that have occurred to the planet’s seasons. “The new study found that, on average, summer grew from 78 to 95 days between 1952 to 2011, while winter shrank from 76 to 73 days. Spring and autumn also contracted from 124 to 115 days, and 87 to 82 days, respectively”. Animal migration and plant flowering times have also been altered.

A deposit of 61,000 Filecoin was made on Binance. The end result was around 120,000 FIL, indicating that there is a clear problem in this scenario. The user got double what they deposited. Due to an overlooked flaw in the remote procedure call used by the coin when making a deposit, it was possible to essentially double-spend a deposit to an exchange. Traders could start a deposit and send the funds to Binance. If the transaction was taking its time, one could increase the fee with a replace-by-fee transaction. Instead of rejecting the initial transaction though, Binance credited both due to the flaw. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/filecoin-double-deposit-on-binance-exploit-open-other-exchanges?amp=1\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><span style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold;\">Visa Plans to Support Spending Bitcoin<\/span><br \/>Following Bitcoin's explosive growth at the start of 2021, many financial companies have been racing to release cryptocurrency integrations with their products and services. Visa has been looking at ways to give their card users the ability to spend Bitcoin and stablecoins on the go. During a podcast, Al Kelly, Visa's CEO, revealed that the financial services giant is trying to do two things. The first aim \"is to enable the purchase of bitcoin on Visa credentials.\" The second, more exciting aim, involves the corporation \"working with bitcoin wallets to allow the bitcoin to be translated into a fiat currency.\" This would mean that customers would be able to use their Visa card at 70 million places around the world and pay with Bitcoin anywhere. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.financemagnates.com\/cryptocurrency\/news\/visa-ceo-reveals-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-plans\/\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&uid=4913576][img]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uTDEFhy.png[\/img][\/url][\/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Waste of Time[\/color][\/b]\r\nAfter a century of practicing “Daylight Saving Time”, scientists are now questioning if it is effective. “When coal still ruled, daylight saving time was implemented as a way to maximize limited daylight hours.” Germany was the first country to put daylight saving time into action during “World War I”. Data also suggests that changing clocks leads to increases in heart attacks as well as deadly car accidents. Many believe that daylight saving time is ineffective and countries around the globe have begun drafting bills to halt this practice.

This means that humans were consuming “psychoactive” drugs up to four centuries ago. Researchers found “quids” that were packed into small cracks around the site. They “initially took a sample of quids, hoping to find traces of ancient human DNA.” Many have wondered what inspired rock art paintings, and this evidence fills in a missing piece of the puzzle.

To combat the decrease, researchers have devised a means of pollinating plants themselves. They have “equipped drones with sprayers that release pollen-laden soap bubbles from a distance.” Some worry that this will interrupt services to restore bees and other insects. For now, researchers hope that this equipment will be able to assist “natural pollinators” around the world.

The company has opted to run its own Bitcoin nodes as a part of the move, being one of the first publicly-listed companies to do so. Elon Musk took to Twitter to announce the change, stating that \"Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly.\" He also said that the \"Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin,\" meaning the company will be holding the BTC it receives, as opposed to selling it and converting it into a fiat currency. It has been reported that other car manufacturers are looking into accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment as well, with General Motors supposedly looking to get feedback from their customers on the matter. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1374619379929772034\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><br><span style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold;\">Time Magazine Plans to Accept Crypto<\/span><br>The long-running American magazine has revealed plans to begin accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment for subscriptions.

For months in certain parts of Iceland, there was constant shaking day night. The shaking was strong enough to prevent many citizens from falling asleep at night. Researchers have been following these developments closely because they believe these events will lead to more intense activity later. &ldquo;The possibility of future eruptions is underscored by the fact that the type of seismic shaking leading up to last week&rsquo;s eruption has happened before&mdash;three times before, in fact, in the past few thousand years.&rdquo; Scientists are currently learning more about the factors which cause these events. <a href=\"https:\/\/hackforums.net\/blog.php#https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/article\/eruption-in-iceland-may-mark-start-of-decades-of-volcanic-activity?loggedin=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&gt;&gt; Source<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>It&rsquo;s Raining Electrons<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>For years a &ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1029\/2000GL000106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fuzzy patch of auroral lights<\/a>&rdquo; has confused researchers, however, the mystery may have finally been resolved.

The online payments system giant has, in recent times, implemented purchasing certain coins directly through their platform.

The change gives people who have Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, or Litecoin in their PayPal wallets the option to instantly convert it into a fiat currency at the checkout so that it can be used as a payment.

The CEO of Kraken, a competing cryptocurrency exchange, revealed in an interview that the company is \"looking at being able to go public sometime next year,\" with next year being 2022. Powell also stated that Kraken has been delaying seeking new investors so that they can \"see where the Coinbase valuation comes in at.\" Should Coinbase receive a multi-billion dollar valuation through their public listing, it will indicate to Kraken that they could run a new funding round to increase their valuation to reach similar levels. <a href=\"https:\/\/u.today\/kraken-confirms-its-plan-to-go-public-in-2022\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div id=\"x-animenews\" class=\"x-animenews\">\r\n        <p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><a style=\"color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=3493494\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fj0hMCC.png\" alt=\"\" ><\/a><br><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>Saudi Arabia's Manga Productions, Toei to Open The Journey Film in Japan on June 25<br><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/span>The Journey (Journey: Taiko Arabia Hantо̄ de no Kiseki to Tatakai no Monogatari, or Journey: A Tale of Miracles and Battles on the Ancient Arabian Peninsula) anime will premiere in Japan on June 25.

The global head of digital assets, Matthew McDermott, described the coin as not behaving similiar to other assets, going on to state that \"it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class.\" To many in the cryptocurrency scene, this was not met with open arms. Users on Reddit joked about how Goldman Sachs must have bought the dip. Some commenters discussed how they believe that the firm saw this as nothing more than a money making opportunity, as opposed to a chance to help advance the acceptance of cryptocurrencies, and that this statement is solely because of that. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/njvog2\/we_can_all_breath_a_collective_sigh_of_relief\/\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source<\/span><\/a><\/p><br>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold;\">Tesla Removes Bitcoin Payment Option<\/span><br>In a tweet on the 12th of May, Elon Musk revealed that Tesla had \"suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin.\" What was their reasoning? Concern about the \"use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions.\" Many were quick to point out in replies to Musk that miners often use renewable energy sources for their farms, as well as mentioning how the production of cars and launching of rockets is just as harmful to the environment, if not more. In later tweets, Musk mentioned working with Doge developers to \"improve system transaction efficiency,\" potentially hinting towards a future where people can buy a Tesla with Dogecoin. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1392602041025843203\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;\">&gt;&gt;Source<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div id=\"x-animenews\" class=\"x-animenews\">\r\n        <p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><a style=\"color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https:\/\/hackforums.net\/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=3493494\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fj0hMCC.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"766\" height=\"204\"><\/a><br><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>Demon Slayer Is Now the #2 Anime Film in the U.S. of All Time<br><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Funimation announced on Saturday that Demon Slayer – Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train is presently the #2 most earning anime film ever at the U.S. box office.
