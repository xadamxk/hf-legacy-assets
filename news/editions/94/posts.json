One of the current leaders of this group, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=877976]Lust.[/url], has posted a recruitment thread that answers a few of the questions. In addition to that, he has also announced that the group will become invite only. Also, both Respawn and Eminence have changed their userbars this week.

The group has claimed to have obtained the website's database, however, as of right now, there is no proof to support that. Since Hack Forums only uses the MyBB software and isn't affiliated with their website, Hack Forums members have nothing to worry about--unless of course you used the same username and password combination for both sites.

Such a lovely day.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™[/b][/color][/url]: Haha, sweet. To start off, do you want to give any HF members a shout out?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#0066FF][b]Chief.[/b][/color][/url]: SomeWhiteGuy, Dan., Hexicidal, Lust., Phenomenal and of course, you!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™[/b][/color][/url]: Awesome! Well, to start this interview off why don't you explain what brought you to Hackforums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#0066FF][b]Chief.[/b][/color][/url]: I was trying to heck accounts for various websites such as TTG, xbox, Youtube, and a few others. I wanted to get into hacking and become a epic hacker but I never did. I just was a normal guy lurking around on the forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™[/b][/color][/url]: Haha, that's pretty much the reason why I came across Hackforums. So if you never became an epic hacker, what made you stay?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#0066FF][b]Chief.[/b][/color][/url]: Well I met a few cool guys like Carbon, Mike., Thoth, and Lith. I hung with them for a while then they eventually faded out and never returned. I decided to go into coding and websites so I started learning. Made a few fail forums and just tried to get one going. I stuck around to help out in the website section. Once you become addicted to HF it's hard to leave.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™[/b][/color][/url]: I totally agree, HF is very addicting! Well, when I met you at first it was right before you got put in the Dead group, how did you get back after that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#0066FF][b]Chief.[/b][/color][/url]: I honestly don't know. It was right after I said some stuff to Omni and was in a \"troll-mode\". I was like really sad to see that I would no longer be able to attend HF. I just sat around for 2 months checking about every other week to see if he had lifted it. No luck. One day he made a video and i happened to see it and said I was sorry for being an asshole and such. Few days later I was back.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™[/b][/color][/url]: Woah, that's pretty impressive! - Well, it sucks for you to be put there anyway. So other than being a self proclamed webmaster, do you have any other skills?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#0066FF][b]Chief.[/b][/color][/url]: I would say I have some decent gaming skills. I'm also a coder and as you know I've always tried to get into graphics but I never go really far. I'm mainly aiming toward coding and webmastering as those are my best subjects and I'll probably look for a job that includes those.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™[/b][/color][/url]: Well I wish you the best of luck with finding a job that includes webmastering and coding. As for the interview, I think it's time to wrap it up. So It has been fantastic talking with you today, and is there anything you'd like to say?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#0066FF][b]Chief.[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for having me Adam. It was a pleasure. To everyone who reads this \"I love you. <3\" Thanks again bro.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075]Robbieva[/url][/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for participating in the 94th edition of HF News  \nAny shout outs to other members before we start?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: Well I'd like to say that I miss a lot of members that are not \naround anymore. (Carbon, The Rated R Super Star, Nubby, etc). I do love Xypher and Qwazz though. I plan to meet them this summer(:\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah sad too see a lot of members from a long time ago not be so\nactive no more. Well I hope you the best of luck this summer. ;) So Robbieava, How did you find Hack Forums ?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: Well back in the summer of 09' (It's coming around my full 3rd \nyear of HF woo!) I was interested in hacking after probably watching some sort of movie. Eventually I was brought here. Never did end up becoming a hacker. LOL!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Oh 3 years on HF really long time man, Personally a lot of people come to HF to learn\nhacking but never actually follow through with it. So you've probably been asked before but I see you're now a Mentor, How did you feel when you got asked ? <3\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah I know! I finally will feel like an old fag! I ended up \nlearning how to crack porn passwords, but I didn't really keep with it.. Haha. I was thoroughly impressed to be one of the first mentors in general, but Omni never asked me. \nIt had been obvious that I wanted to be one, and he didn't ask, just one day told me I was on the team. ^_^\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Oh so you was a porn addict back then, nothing better than \nporn I guess lol. Now I heard it was a hard job being in the Mentors, Lets see your opinion on being a mentor, Do you find it hard when you first started or even till this \nday is it still a hard job ?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: I find the job to be as hard as you make it. I personally find \nit hard for the fact that I moderate on my iphone, but when available to a computer the job is simple. With a large amount of mentors, it makes it easy. We couldn't do it \nwithout one another.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: I agree, it's a team job and if you work together you can get \nanything done. Well I apologise for interviewing you while you're on your iphone lol.\nIf you could change anything on HackForums, what would it be? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: Exactly. I would have left the human manipulation subforum open.\nI really enjoyed hanging around in there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Oh right, Well a lot of people seem to have liked that subforum,\nwas a good reason it got closed though. Now if you got asked to be staff would you take that position or would you stay Mentor ?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: Yes it seems everything good has to come to an end. (: I think \nif I were asked in august I'd say yes. This summer is just too hectic with a road trip to Ohio then spending 3 weeks in california. ^_^\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Oh nice I wish you the best Holiday man, Yeah you're right everything does \ncome to an end sadly. Well I don't want to keep you too long man, it's been amazing interviewing you, any last things you want to say ?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: Hmm.. When I officially come back, computer and all; the day will be glorious. (;\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]:Why did you leave for about 7 months ?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=81075][color=white][b]Robbieava[/b][/color][/url]: I was actually clearing up life situations in which I turned myself around. I have now been sober since around the time I left. (:\n[/spoiler]",

Warner Brother's Interactive Entertainment announced, Lego Lord of the Rings for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Nintendo DS, 3DS, Playstation Vita and PC. The game will be based on Peter Jackson's Oscar winning film trilogy, \"Lord of the Rings.\" The game will follow the storylines for each movie, unlike Lego Harry Potter, which was split over two games, the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy will be held within one game. Discussion is being held on an exact date for release, at the moment, it is expected to be ready sometime around October.\n\n[color=white][b]Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 Announced[/b][/color]\nKonami announced that Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 has began production at Mercury Steam. The game was revealed via a trailer during their pre-E3 conference, where they also confirmed the game would be released for the Playstation 3 as well as the Xbox 360. The trailer features Gabriel Belmont, going head-to-head against an army. After killing several soldiers, Belmont takes the form of a large bird to fight a giant golem creature. A mysterious blonde woman appears, which suggests potential new characters. The president of Konami Entertainment promises to release more information concerning the game later on this year. \n\n[color=white][b]Skyrim: Dawnguard DLC Free?[/b][/color]\nRight now, the public has a chance to win early FREE access to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's first DLC, \"Dawnguard.\" Bethesda is offering this to anyone who applies to beta-test the Xbox 360 version of the DLC. Any gamers interested in applying can apply for the beta period at the Dawnguard website.

There was no information on whether or not applications are available for Playstation 3 or PC gamers. A Betesda representative stated, \"Dawnguard is nly announced for Xbox 360, so that's the only platform we are talking about now.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jl0EswX4V4jJf.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Interpol hunt for Canadian killer[/b][/color]\nThe International Criminal Police Organisation have recently issued a ‘Red Notice wanted-persons alert’ for a suspected killer, Luka Magnotta. He is thought to have fled Canada last weekend after committing a grisly murder, and then posting body parts to Canadian political parties. After police searched Magnotta’s apartment in Montreal, a headless torso was found. The v[i]i[/i]ctim is thought to be Jun Lin, a 33 year old Chinese student who was studying at the Engineering and Computer Science faculty at Montreal’s Concordia University.\nThere are reports which link Luka to the posting of two videos in the past, one that showed two kittens being placed in a plastic bag and suffocated, and another of a kitten being fed alive to a python.\n\n[color=white][b]Ghana Cargo plane crash[/b][/color]\nIn the capital Accra, a cargo plane collided with a bus filled with passengers.

That is what was reported by a recent judgment in a Georgia court, where it was stated that Gucci Mane owes a total of $274,523.34 to a local jewelry company known as A&A Diamonds. A&A Diamonds claimed that they loaned the ATL rapper a $130,000 diamond ring as well as a diamond necklace and bracelet worth $110k. Gucci was given 15 days to pay for the jewelry in full or return it to the jeweler, but instead, he only offered a payment of a measly $40k. A&A got their lawyers together and sued the rapper for the missing $200,000 plus interest and their lawyer fees. Gucci Mane did not show up in court and a default judgment was made against him. A lien has officially been placed on his property, and Gucci Mane has still yet to respond.\n\n[color=white][b]Lil Wayne and Drake Lose $400k Court Ruling[/b][/color]\nLil Wayne and Drake are trying to win back their money after a judge's recent ruling has them owing $400,000 for missing a concert last year. Lil Wayne and Drake are claiming that they are not responsible for the missed show because they were not told about it. The Imperial Entertainment Group won the case, totaling approximately $423,337.50, alleging that Lil Wayne and Drake did not show up to an event where they agreed to perform. In the rappers' rebuttal, however, they claim that they were never informed about the gig, never signed any contracts, and were not even summoned to defend themselves in court. In their own defense, Lil Wayne and Drake are asking the court to reverse its ruling and free them of the $400,000+ burden on the grounds IEG used an unauthorized third party, which was Melanzh Enterprise, to book them. This recent court battle is the latest problem that the YMCMB stars are involved in. \n\n[color=white][b]Justin Bieber Suspected in Battery Case[/b][/color]\nJustin Bieber is no longer a little boy. There is a Calabasas photographer who is accusing him of battery. Justin Bieber reportedly got into a fight with paparazzo over the weekend, and now he is a suspect in a police investigation. The incident reportedly took place on a Sunday afternoon outside a mall in the California town where Justin Bieber lives. TMZ reported that Bieber was trying to leave the mall with Selena Gomez, but the photographer blocked his car in an attempt to get pictures of the couple. Bieber asked the photographer to get out of the way, and the photographer declined, leading to some sort of physical altercation. Justin Bieber and his girlfriend, Selena Gomez, left the scene shortly after the incident. The photographer called 911 and was apparently driven away in an ambulance. He complained of chest pain and filed a report with the police. Investigators are tying to talk with Justin Bieber because he could be facing a misdemeanor battery charge — as well as Selena Gomez. The 18-year-old Bieber was reportedly taking boxing lessons with Mike Tyson earlier in the weekend. Justin Bieber is not in a mood to be messed with.\n\n[color=white][b]2 Chainz Arrested at LaGuardia Airport[/b][/color]\nAtlanta rapper, 2 Chainz, was arrested at New York City's La Guardia airport after his jewelry reportedly set off the metal detectors at the security checkpoint. The rap star was charged with possession of a criminal weapon on May 22nd, because the TSA officials found a four-finger ring in his bag. They believed it to be brass knuckles. 2 Chainz had already worn the ring in Atlanta, and when he flew into New York with the piece, he had no problems. It was not until he tried to leave the city that he ran into issues. Apparently, the rapper, who was recently named spokesman for the 2012 \"Respect My Vote!\" campaign, is no longer in custody.\n\n[color=white][b]50 Cent: I Haven't Spoken to Lloyd Banks in Nine Months[/b][/color]\nIt's not a big secret that G-Unit is no longer as close as it once was, but in an interview, 50 Cent revealed that Lloyd Banks is even more estranged than fans may have thought. 50 cent stated that he hasn't spoken to Lloyd Banks in nearly a year. \"I haven't spoken to him,\" 50 said when questioned if he still talks with Banks. \"I haven't spoken to him in nine months.\" 50 said it wasn't the first time the rapper, Lloyd Banks, had gone off the grid and stopped communicating. He said the Queens rapper also disappeared for nearly a year after his father had passed away. “He goes through these things where there’s no communication and then he goes off and he does what he want,” 50 Cent said. The G-Unit general said it doesn't bother him if Banks takes some time off, and that he still communicates with him through his lawyers just to be assured that certain obligations are fulfilled. “Because I want them to be individuals and operate on they own away from me, I’m fine with it,\" he said. \"I’ll tell his lawyers cause his lawyers call me and I tell them to make sure that he does things.... His way of dealing with things is not dealing with it.” \"He's a baby — the youngest member of G-Unit,\" Fif said by way of an explanation for Banks' actions and behavior. \"He got really rich at 19.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of The Week:[/b][/color]\n[spoiler]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic&feature=g-music[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI'd like to apologize for this edition. A lot of things happened that weren't in our control. Several people were missing in action, decided to quit, or were unable to perform. I am trying to get things in control, it seems as though once things start to go smoothly, everything decides to fall apart. I hope you all enjoyed it anyways.\n\n[b]Changes:[/b]\nEruditus quit World News, but was added back for Tech News\nTheVortex to World News\nWaleed quit Interviewer\nSoulZeh to Interviewer\nGenuine quit Music News\nBay to Music News",

Be it, \nsomething to do with referral's or just a new award addition. All though Hack \nForums is moving at such a rapid pace in terms of growth, I believe that soon \nwe will reach our peak and go into a decline. Maybe, not this year, maybe not \nthe next, but it will happen. So that's when new ideas need to be implemented \nfor members like ourselves to advertise and help HF grow. \"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992333][i]-Accident[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think one great suggestion I saw was Fetus Flippers idea for a \nBusiness section. It would benefit me personally, and I can see it helping many \nother members who are already involved in the business world, or they are like \nme and just starting off. I hope Omni recognizes this and takes the suggestion.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=880313][i]-Endloop[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"Which award do you think is the most important one?
