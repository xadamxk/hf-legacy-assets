As a new rule, all discussions, programs, sales, and advice when it comes to stealing BitCoins or any other means of BitCoin fraud have been permanently disallowed. The new rule states:\n[quote]\n[i]Bitcoin Fraud - We consider BTC the alternate crypto currency of choice here on HF. And while it has no official government backing we feel it has value to this community. As such any BTC fraud will be considered financial fraud. Discussion on stealing BTC wallets including RATS will not be allowed on HF.[/i]\n[/quote]\nIt can be read in the rules by visiting the [url=http://hackforums.net/misc.php?action=help&hid=21]Help Documents[/url]. Even though BitCoin is not considered an \"official\" currency, the recent surge in activity surrounding the coin on Hack Forums has been more than enough for [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] to block any fraudulent activities regarding Bitcoins. However, this only covers BitCoins for now. No other crypto-currencies such as LiteCoin are a part of this rule. As is the norm with new rules, participating in what is considered \"Disallowed Blackhat Activity\" is an easy way to get a forum account banned or warned. The thread announcing the rule can be read [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3877436]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]JTAG Subforum Added[/b][/color]\nIn a Twitter status on Saturday, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] announced the addition of a JTAG subforum in the XBOX section. He states that this new section should be used to discuss JTAG mods for the XBOX 360 system. A basic explanation of what a JTAG is can be read about [url=http://www.thetechgame.com/Tutorials/id=1271/what-a-jtag-is-and-if-your-xbox-is-jtagable.html]here[/url]. The Twitter announcement can be seen [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/404374429683036161]here[/url]. So far, there has not been a thread announcing the change on Hack Forums.\n\n[color=white][b]Modern Blue[/b][/color]\nThis week sees the addition of a new theme on Hack Forums, known as \"Modern Blue\". It is a blue variant of the \"Modern Purple\" theme that the members of Hack Forums have had the option of using for the past few weeks. A Twitter status made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] states that this new theme is set as the default theme for all members. Of course, users are still free to change it to the theme of their choice by using the option in their UserCP page. The Twitter status can be seen [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/403033631486009344]here[/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iyobmhGt2yol0.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951][color=#EFEFEF][b]Evangelist[/b][/color][/url] has hit 10,000 posts.

Today we're interviewing -Nas. How's it going? Any shoutouts before we start?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Hey man, and yup. I want to give shoutouts to Bugga, JD, Arsenios, and PandaVenom.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome! I like to start off talking about HF related topics and then move on to more personal questions. So for starters, what bought you to HackForums to begin with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Well, a really close friend of mine told me about HF and that would be Formula1, three years ago but I never signed up. Two years later I stumbled on the forums and this time signed up. I really enjoyed it, so I stayed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Ahh, so not looking for a booter to hit people offline with? That seems to be the most common response I hear. Well for being here 14 months, you've certainly built a name for yourself in a short amount of time. How did you get yourself \"known\" on the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Not surprised there, and I was always pretty cool to everyone. I just wanted to be the \"cool guy\" on HF since at the time when I joined there was tons of drama. Then I met a few nice people on the forums and they helped me a lot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So I noticed you're a member of Infamous, The Empire, and Legion, not to mention you're a leader of Complexity. How'd that come to be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Well, first group I was invited to was Complexity and I met a lot of great people there. At that time there was a GFX coordinator for the GFX sector but he couldn't stay active so someone else had to take care of it, so I decided to. After that I just started helping the GFX sector then I started helping the whole group and became one of the Complexity Leaders. Later I got invited to The Empire to be the GFX sector coordinator. I guess after that I just got invited to Legion as a student and Infamous.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] A GFX kind of guy, huh? Have you applied to Fly By Night yet? What do you think of that group by the way?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Nope not yet, but maybe will soon when I get enough time to do so. Well, I think the group has amazing and mature leaders who really care for the members and always want them to improve and do better at whatever art they do.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I agree. Moving on, what are some future goals you've set for yourself to accomplish in the next year or two, either HF related or in real life? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'm planning on getting a degree in college for web development, and maybe work for a company or make my own company which will be really exciting to experience. On HackForums, I just want to make more/new friends and learn more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You're a web dev? I didn't know that. What kind of company, exactly?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, a newbie web dev. Well, I wanna make a company similar to craigslist/ebay but easier. I got a few ideas in mind. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So tell us about yourself in general? Who is -Nas in the real world?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'm from Brooklyn NY always lived there my entire life. Nas is a rap legend, well for me. He is a famous New York rapper who influenced a lot of other rappers like ( Eminem, Jay-Z, and J-Cole ) and always since I was young I loved his music.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I admit, I was in a Nas phase for a bit last year. Do you like modern hip-hop? Maybe some Chance The Rapper or Vic Mensa? What else do you listen to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Well, unfortunately I don't and it's pretty sad how rap/hip-hop changed the last few years. It went from being great to shitty music ( in my opinion ). The only 'new' hip-hop music I listened to lately would be j-coles album and eminems album, both are really good albums and amazing artists.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see. Well I have to ask, what are your thoughts on the HF news? Anything you'd like to see us work on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I think the HF news is really useful in a lot of ways. It's a great place to see and know what's going on Hack Forums or even see what's going on around the world! So, on that note I would say it's perfect the way it is. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Glad to hear. Anything else before we end this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452196][color=white][b]-Nas:[/b][/color][/url] You're a noob.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Hey Cyph, welcome to the 170th edition of the HF News! How are you doin' today? Anyone you'd like to shout out before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] Hello Clique I am doing fine today could be better but meh. I would like to shout out my InstinctNubs, Vinnie, Prime, Tiszy and Thr.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'm sure they'll be happy to see their names up there. Actually, I have a question: What does your name mean? Anything special?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] Well not a special meaning But the member Cyph is a person who i know in real life and as were so close why not make my name Cyph Jr.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Neato. So, how'd you find HF? Heard about it from a friend, or on your own?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] Well that's a funny story lol. I wanted to learn more about computers and stuff, then one day I heard on the news about some hackers that got arrested for something I can't remember what it is ATM but I thought to myself why not try and become a hacker so I booted up my PC and searched hacking then the first thing that came up was hf.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True! Did you immediately start lookin' for hacking programs and stuff like that? I think we can all admit that we did at some point. \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] Well not immediately but after a while I did, When I first joined I was interested in booter/Ddosing I eventually started my own with a friend who I knew since I was coding for rsbuddy who was an excellent PHP coder and did a source for us.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's actually pretty neat. Seeing that you're now a leader of Instinct; how are you liking it?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] To be honest, I really like it. The members accepted me pretty well. They treat me like how they treat everyone else. I don't like to be treated like a special person I'm human like everyone else.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Speakin' the truth. Do you have anything planned for the group that you can announce publicly?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] I will be doing a gamertag giveaway which I will start working on soon. I'm also working on future instinct products which will be announced later on before the release.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds awesome man. What do you do outside of the internet? Have a career set up yet?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm still in high school but I'm an athlete I like to play basketball with my friends and I play baseball as an official sport.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Are you going to try to make sports apart of your career? That'd be pretty cool if ya' did. Anyways, are you following NBA? Which team are you rooting for?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm not that really good at basketball so that would be out of the question but baseball probably if it happens then that would be great. I'm currently rooting for the Knicks as I'm from NY.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Go Knicks! Saw that you're getting close to your two year anniversary here; what's your most memorable moment on the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1659032]Cyph Jr[/url]:[/b][/color] My most memorable moment so far has to be when I found someone on hack forums I knew in real life. we Kept it a secret till this day to certain people that we go on \"Hack Forums\". The rest of them who cares.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Wow, that's pretty neat.  I enjoyed interviewing ya' bud.

So what made you become active here - aside from cyberzone5?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=1579189][color=white][b]Freddy Kruеger:[/b][/color][/url] Cybezone5 is the soul reason of our existance.\nIn all seriousness though, I just love the HF community despite all the trolls, kids and what not, then again every community has it's fair share of that crap.\nI remained active to basically discuss things I enjoy, I didn't have many friends at the time so I came here to talk discuss my interests.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahahaha. Well said. So what are your primary interests?

However, similar to the PS4 launch, many problems have come up. Users have experienced grinding noises, Kinect problems and other disc related problems. Microsoft has issued a statement on the issue saying that there is a low number of affected consoles in the wild. Microsoft has also offered an exchange program, where users can submit an exchange request and Microsoft will send them a new console before the faulty one is returned. If you are experiencing issues, it is recommended you submit a service request on the Xbox website. Microsoft also announced that over one million Xbox One consoles have been sold in the first 24 hours. \"We are humbled and grateful for the excitement of Xbox fans around the world,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, Corporate Vice President of Marketing and Strategy, Xbox.  \"Seeing thousands of excited fans lined up to get their Xbox One and their love for gaming was truly a special moment for everyone on the Xbox team.\n\n[color=white][b]EA Next-Gen Difficulties[/b][/color]\nThe Electronic Arts CEO posted a statement on the official website stating that EA is aware of the next-generation game problems and are working on fixing such problems. Both Xbox One and PS4 next-generation titles are affected. The CEO specifically referred to issues in BF4 and NBA Live 14. He promises we will receive prompt updates and transparent communication straight from the BF4 Control Room. He also commented on NBA,  \"Plain and simple, we haven't gotten the kind of early feedback we had hoped for on this game. I do think we have built a strong foundation, so we're accelerating a number of game updates to address your biggest issues, including improving the way the game teaches the new gameplay controls. We promised to get back to top form with NBA LIVE, and we're committed to delivering on that. We are in this for the long haul.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nXbox One Launch Montage.\n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JCZCusE_cg[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Snapshot 13w47e-- Twitch.tv Streaming![/b][/color]\nMentioned previously in the form of articles, statements, and press releases at Minecon, it has been noted that Twitch.tv streaming directly from Minecraft would be implemented in the near future. It's not quite there yet; however, Mojang has included it to be tested with in their newest snapshot for the game. Players have multiple options congruent to the streaming process such as voice volume, game volume, the ability to enable or disable chat in game, quality measures, and broadband settings. All of such, then, are accessible via hitting the escape key and viewing options. \n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft PE-- Beta Testing[/b][/color]\nAs of November 22nd, Mojang had released a beta version of Minecraft Pocket Edition for anyone that had purchased the game on an Android device via Google Play. To play such, however, anyone who is interested must apply to the [url=https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/110318910880257661259]Minecraft PE Test Group[/url]. As of right now, there aren't any limitations, but developers for the game had stated that they may need to limit the number of testers at some point. They had stated that the edition of the game might not be compatible with that of the others, presenting the chance that some previous worlds might not work on the beta.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nThe HackerCraft news is still hereby postponed.

In a deal [url=https://twitter.com/JZarif/statuses/404430013488852993]announced over Twitter[/url], Iran agreed to halt development of its nuclear program and keep all future enrichment at 5% while diluting its stockpile of near 20% uranium. In exchange, the P5+1 agrees to unfreeze Iran's offshore accounts, worth over $4.2 billion, granted in installments over the next six months. The White House was [url=http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-deal-reached-details-nuclear-program-sanctions-relief-2013-11]quick to put the deal into perspective[/url] noting that approximately $100 billion of Iran's foreign holdings are held back by sanctions.\n\n[color=white][b]Intelligence Agencies Infect Over 50,000 Networks[/b][/color]\nRecently released NSA documents indicated malicious attacks on thousands of computer networks add to the growing list of revelations leaked by Edward Snowden this year. One example of these attacks involved the British intelligence service (GCHQ) having phished employees of Belgacom, a Belgium based telecom provider, into accessing a fake Linkedin page and installing malware onto their computers. The attacks let intelligence agencies such as the NSA and GCHQ tap and record the data of all users on an infected network and control the network remotely.\n\n[color=white][b]China Claims Military Air Zone Over Contested Islands, Tensions with Japan “Very Dangerous”[/b][/color]\nChinese State Media [url=https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/404084141156626432/photo/1]announced over Twitter last friday[/url] that the Chinese government is now classifying the air space over the Senkaku Islands as an  “air defense identification zone” and have scrambled jets to patrol the area. Despite Japanese assertions, China has has claimed the small islets as their own since the United States returned them to Japan in 1972. Over the past few decades, tensions between Japan and China have risen as the two conducted military exercises near the islands in an attempt to exert their influence. The Senkaku Islands are small, rocky, and uninhabited islands approximately 76 nautical miles north of Taiwan.\n\n[color=white][b]A Completely Drug Resistant Super Bacteria Found[/b][/color]\nThe first superbug was discovered when Brian Pool, a New Zealand English teacher, was treated for a brain hemorrhage. Testing classified the bacteria as KPC-Oxa 48 and found it was able to resist every antibiotic thrown at it. Mark Jones, the doctor treating Pool, described the situation as being “in a post-antibiotic era... this is why so many agencies over the world are raising alarm bells” (via [i][url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11159413]The New Zealand Herald[/url][/i]). A “post-antibiotic” bug is a bacteria that has developed a resistance to all treatments as drug vulnerable strains died out. The discovery has spurred existing worries that more diseases can reach a similar state of post-antibiotics, which would render much of modern medicine useless against such a threat.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Philadelphia Bans 3D Printed Guns[/b][/color]\n3D printed guns made a name for themselves a few months back when The Liberator was put online. As of this past week, Philadelphia became the first city to ban 3D printed guns, saying that it was a preventative measure. This is a big decision for the city, and may lead to other cities doing the same in the near future.\n\n[color=white][b]Amazon Now Allows Gifting Of Prime[/b][/color]\nThe online retailer has announced that customers can now gift their friends a year of Amazon Prime.  The service is $79 per year and the recipient will get an email on the date of the giver's choosing with activation instructions. Amazon Prime allows subscribers to receive two day shipping on packages bought directly from an Amazon supplied, access over 41,000 television shows and movies, and check out eBooks from Amazon's extensive digital book library.\n\n[color=white][b]Google+ For iOS Gets Photo Backups and Location Sharing[/b][/color]\nGoogle is now holding up their end of a promise to iOS users, giving them full-size photo and video backups to their Google+ account on iOS. This means people can upload full resolution images as long as there is enough cloud storage. This update also introduces a new location-sharing option that was in the previous Android releases. You can upgrade your Google+ app from the App Store.\n\n[color=white][b]MediaFire Releases Desktop UI For Cloud Storage[/b][/color]\nUp until just recently, you'd have to use MediaFire's website to use cloud storage on your computer. MediaFire has recently released a desktop application, at what is arguably the height of popularity for cloud storage. The desktop app is similar to Dropbox, seeing as it integrates into OS X Finder or Windows Explorer. The app also comes with a screenshot tool, with which you can click an icon to take a screenshot of your desktop. You can annotate images before sharing them with people you know. The app is currently available for download, though it is still in beta, so expect small performance issues.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Happy Birthday Miley Cyrus[/color][/b]\nMiley officially turned 21 on November 23rd, and burglars tried to spoil her 21st birthday. On Friday, authorities reportedly responded to a home break-in at an address known to belong to the pop star. She had a few things stolen, but police have not released much info about what was stolen. Although there were no signs of forced entry, a burglary was first reported Friday afternoon at a home in Studio City, an address known to belong to Miley, according to CNN. Los Angeles police told CNN that the homeowner said that there was no sign of forced entry, but that personal items were reported stolen. \n\n[color=white][b]American Music Awards[/b][/color]\nThe AMAs are tonight and you can check them out on ABC tonight at 8PM EST and 8PM PST (West Coast will not be live). Hosting this year is Pitbull, promising the 'biggest party' at AMAs. Katy Perry is opening the live ABC broadcast Sunday night from the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles with her latest single \"Unconditionally.\" Three hours after Perry opens the show, Miley Cyrus will close things down. In between, most of the year's top performers are scheduled to take the stage, including Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Pitbull will perform with Ke$ha, and Jennifer Lopez will offer a tribute to Celia Cruz.

I'm looking, I'm watching Drake perform, I see Bruno Mars perform, and shit,\" Kanye told the crowd, as seen in a video posted online by RealTalkNY.com on Thursday morning (November 21). \"And then they start giving out awards and shit, and Bruno Mars won all the motherfucking awards, and shit.\" Uh, sorry to prove you wrong Yeezy, but Bruno only won two awards. Kanye also took aim at the fashion world and the folks who once stopped him from entering the Givenchy and Balenciaga fashion shows. \"But if you sell enough sneakers, you get diminishing returns because they want you to stay in that position forever,\" he continued, referencing the success he has had designing sneakers for Louis Vuitton and his Air Yeezy model for Nike. He then went onto to jab at Nike CEO Mark Parker. \"They tried to make it as small as possible. Mark Parker even talked shit, talking about, 'We don't even know why people like the Yeezys,'\" he shouted. \"They like 'em like they like the Jordans, because I was in fourth grade getting kicked out for drawing Jordans.\" Check out the rant [url=http://youtu.be/ABYryBGTaCE]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P1zQ2oj5MM[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nFamily.
