For 9 days OMC was down as well as of course the OMC auction. However on February 19th, 2015 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread announcing that OMC has been added back onto the exchange, this means OMC is getting back on its feet. We can all thank the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1256441][color=#00AAFF][b]Abraham Lincoln[/b][/color][/url] for his hard work on getting this all accomplished. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] now thinks that when Coinpayments enables it again he will be able to re-open the EP1C upgrade and OMC award. This is all great as this will get the ball rolling again with the official group auction biddable via OMC. If you'd like to read the announcement from [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] you may feel free to do so, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4694859]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Update on the Phoenix Situation and Tibit[/b][/color]\nOn February 17th, 2015 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] announced that he has officially sold a new group to the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2041579][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Porygon[/b][/color][/url]. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] was going to use those funds to pay [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url], however there is suspicion that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url] scammed one member for partial ownership of the group for nearly $4,000. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has addressed these concerns to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url] though he has still not heard back from him regarding the situation. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] then updated that thread with a follow up post stating that he has sent [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url] a payment of $2,000 in which he will use those funds to refund the appropriate people.

Welcome to the 228th edition of the HF News. Any shout outs before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] Hello. I want to give some shout-outs to a couple of friends of mine, Arcane Sky (Sky), Hooded Robin, Vinnie, Starfall & Aura. List would be endless. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Has everything been going well for you? Your social life, school, etc.?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] Social life is great. Studies are going okay, I can't really think of anything that's not great.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] So, tell us a bit about yourself Zayne. What got you started here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] Well.. My handle goes by Zayne & I came to hackforums to study up on security related stuff, or if I could call it hacking. I was one of these neophytes who thought you could blow up a website by pressing a button back then, 'nough said about my previous life.\n\nTo cut it down a bit, I enjoy learning about security as well as I enjoy coding and that's one of my prime hobbies in life.\nOutside this box I do enjoy sports, cars and life. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What exactly have you learned here on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] To be precisely I haven't really mastered anything. I am a well-rounded person in the security field so to say. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Ah, I see. Can you elaborate more on what you do in this field? Do you specialize in anything specific?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] I specialize in the website-security field. I know the basics, enough to get around.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] It seems like you're quite known for your group, Pernicious Developers. What's that about?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] Pernicious Developers (PD) is a group of like minded individuals who share the same aspects and are interested in technology. I don't know if it's known, we've had our hits though. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I would say it's known since I've seen the group once in a while. What do you do outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] There's a few other communities I visit which are not allowed to be discussed here. I just do what pleases me to be honest with you. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Understandable, what activities do you do outside of the internet? Any sports?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I play sports, attend to gym, studies & hang out with buddies. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Can you mention a specific sport you play? How long, and how good you are at it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] I play two. Football & another one. I've played football for around 4-5 years I believe. I can't tell if I am good or not, but at least I am an okay player. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Being a football player is pretty impressive. What about your social life? Can you tell us more about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] I don't really know what to tell you. My social life is great, never been better.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] By the looks of it, it seems like life couldn't be any better for you. Would you change anything about yourself if you could?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] I don't think so, we've all made mistakes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, we all do. It's good that we can learn from them. Can you give us your opinion on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest, I don't spend as much time here as I used to do. It's just something I visit when I got nothing on my mind. However, it used to be my main community. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I see, I see. Well thanks for taking the time to be with us Zayne! Would you like to say anything else before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1255973][color=white][b]Zayne:[/b][/color][/url] Nothing that crosses my mind. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]'Chief[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] For the 228th edition of the HF News, we have the illustrious and infamous Chief. Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make to the crowd?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for having me. Shoutout to Aura, Corso, Arrow, Cyph Jr, Vinnie, Soccer, Zeus, Crypto Miner, Hobbs, Dorrance, Phyber, Inxy, Snorlax, and I forgot some of you guys' names.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Quite a lot of friends you have. Are they all current friends from over the years, or friends from current groups/subforums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] I've known these cats for years now. They are all true friends, all of them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] You've been here for quite some time, now. What have been the highlights (either good or bad)?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] About 3 years now, and I am hoping for another 3. The highlights of me and my account or the highlights of HF itself? If it's me then I don't think I did anything noteworthy but acquire the White hat awards. I should have done more to earn them, to be honest. Aura, should have given two WHH awards for the many things he's done for the section, anyways... I've done a little bad myself, almost got my account closed once, for pissing of Omni and I sure as hell do not want that to happen. The turkey award was granted for reporting something soo absurd. As for the award whore it was given to me for asking Omni to remove my gift award for $25 LOL. I don't really recall on how I got the asswipe though. HF to me hasn't been anything but a fun ass roller coaster.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] It's certainly been filled with ups and downs for you. Is there anything you miss about HF? Or anything you're looking forward to in the future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] Hell yeah it has. I miss the old userbars, the old theme, the classic flow. I'm not a member you'd describe as an oldfag, but I've been here and experienced shit, you know? I don't know what to expect for the future of HF. I really just hope that HF is still around for the young and up coming kids. Hackforums is a gold mine and they definitely need to sign up and start taking advantage of the vast knowledge around here, when the time is right of course (appropriate age). As for me, I am definitely hoping that i'll get my turkey and asswipe awards removed and replaced with something more reputable. One thing i'd like to address is that I've never donated yet, and wish to do sometime down the road 👍\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] What would you want to replace the Turkey and Asswipe awards, in a perfect world? Is there an award (or awards) that you want more than anything?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] Let's face it, the Turkey and Asswipe awards just proves that I've done something wrong in the past, and I don't want to be remembered as that. I'll prove to Omni that I changed, no more ridiculous requests lol. And I've had my eyes on the Jokester award for quite some time now, never really went and tried to get it like my WHH award, but it'll definitely come in time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Being wrong isn't a bad thing, but being a Jokester is certainly a good thing. What led to your getting the WHH award? Why do you value it so much?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] Being wrong is bad. I wouldn't go the left way because the right way is right (see what I did there?). The reason I wanted get the WHH award was because I was fascinated at what the MRT was doing back then. I didn't become a hacker, like everyone else, instead I wanted to prevent on getting hacked. I taught myself everything I know now, along with the help of my friends Corso, Aura, and Phyber. I value my award so much because of the time spent learning about what it takes on being a WHH. Do you want to know how many times I've spent refreshing that award page? The many times I told myself that today is the day that I will finally get those awards? The many times helping and providing assistance to those who needed it back then? It was all worth it at the end my friend, when I left Aura took control and he sure as hell did more than me. I can't even compare myself to him anymore, but I can say that I taught him a lot of things.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] You're certainly ambitious about White Hat Help. What attracts you to that field so much? Besides the award, I mean. Why do you enjoy the study of malware analysis/removal?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] I get it from my father. Years back, before ever joining HF my pops would always bring home a computer from his work. He'd always be there fixing it the day, finding out the problem and i'd always be there right there next to him examining on what he does. He's some sort of a computing wizard, and I think some of his pixel dust shit rubbed off on me. Although this was when I was in grade school, i'm a college student now\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] What are you studying in college now? Is anything you've learned here on HF relevant to your studies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] Well yea, when I want to be something i'll go pursue that no matter how difficult it is. Anyways I am studying to become a Business Computer Specialist (Salary ranges from $52k-$84k). Hoping to work for some big companies in the near future. I've used everything I learned from HF and applied them to my studies. This is why I love HF, it's like a library.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds great and amazing. Unfortunately, that's all the time left...any closing remarks or comments you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004][color=white][b]'Chief:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks again for having me. Shout out to all the pears 👍\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

Lenovo has been accused of installing certain SSL certificates abd marking them as trusted so they can perform a Man-in-thr-Middle attack. The goal of this attack is to allow Lenovo to inject advertisements into sites secured with TLS/SSL. Lenovo partnered with the company Superfish whose adware was installed on the machines and is notorious for its difficult process of a full removal and its inherently malicious nature. [url=https://marcrogers.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/boa2.png?w=596&h=518]This Picture[/url] highlights the fact that the installed SSL certificate Is being used in place of the original website's. Not only does this allow Lenovo to have access to your secure data, but it opens your machine up for attack by other malicious people as an attacker providing a fake SSL cert would still be accepted by the computer. \n\n[color=white][b]Shodan Compromises Thousands of Home Routsrs[/b][/color]\nThe site [url=http://shodanhq.com]ShodanHQ[/url] is a widely used computer search engine that, quite literally, searches the internet for computers, servers, phones, and other appliances with internet access. It searches for vulnerable services and web applications to help website owners know when they need to update their software. The owner and founder of Shodan, John Matherly, has recently discovered hundreds of thousands of devices that all share the same public and private encryption keys. This would allow a malicious attacker to authenticate himself to over 250,000 home routers, potentially intercepting home users' data. The vulnerability arose by a setup mistake made by the router manufacturers who copied the same public and private keys for SSH access, thus giving anyone with one of the private keys access to all of the others. \n\n[color=white][b]NSA Compromises SIM Cards[/b][/color]\nThe British Government Communications HeadQuarters (GCHQ) and the US's own National Security Agency (NSA) are responsible for the recent attacks on a company that creates Subscriber Identification Modulwle cards, or SIM cards. The SIM is used inthe encryption of communication and gathering the keys of them would allow a certain agency to decrypt telecommunications and retrieve private data. The company that was attacked was Gemalto, the largest SIM card manufacturer in the world, and supplies cards to over 450 mobile networks including AT&T and T-Mobile. The NSA/GCHQ were able to retrieve millions of SIM decryption keys, allowing them to listen in on previously encrypted phone calls of citizens. Not only was Gemalto the victim of cyber-attacks, but upon disclosing that they were attacked, and expressing the possibility of issuing a recall on many devices, their stocks dropped over $415 million, as well as paying for a full investigation.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/zSb3PUT.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=46411]zer0-[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91531]ven0m[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Hackers Steal a Billion in Cyber Bank Heists[/color][/b]\nIn a series of cyber-attacks that have taken up to four months each to carry out, hackers has stolen upwards of a billion USD from over 100 financial companies around the globe. The hackers used a tool known as Carbanak which is the backdoor version based off of the Carberp Trojan. The backdoor was used via spearphishing to install Carbanak on a bank’s internal network. This was all revealed by Kaspersky Lab and there researchers. Kaspersky is advising all financial institutions to go through their network and check for intrusion by Carbanak. The hackers sent spearphishing emails with infected attachments that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010, and Microsoft Word. Drive by download attacks was also used. The hackers impersonated legitimate users to instruct ATMs to dispense cash, to use the banking network to siphon money out of the financial company and into hacker’s accounts. They manipulated Oracle databases to open account at specific banks or to transfer money between other hacker’s accounts. Here is a link to show you visually what was done by these hackers: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUU8bAVgx80#t=12]The Great Bank Robbery[/url]\n\n[b][color=white]Lenovo “Superfish” Adware and How to Deal With It[/color][/b]\nThis issue was caused when Lenovo for the last three months of 2014, shipped adware known as “Superfish” on its laptop computers. It wasn't the adware itself that caused an issue, it was the fact that this now posed a privacy and security risk. Superfish, “Installs a network filter that intercepts all your web traffic, including HTTPS. Carries out a so-called Man in The Middle attack to decrypt your HTTPS traffic. Installs a Trusted Root Certificate so that the MiTM decryption doesn’t produce any warnings”, according to NakedSecurity. This can allow hackers to extract the private signing key it uses for the MiTM attack and abuse that key to sign content of their choice. If you are one of the people who have bought a Lenovo in the past few months, you are going to want to get rid of it. Here’s a link on how to get rid of Superfish adware from Lenovo laptops: [url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/20/how-to-get-rid-of-the-lenovo-superfish-adware/]NakedSecurity \"Superfish\" Removal[/url]\n\n[b][color=white]Twitter Tool to End Password Sharing and Hijackings[/color][/b]\nAfter many Twitter cyber-attacks to well know people including CFO Anthony Noto, Twitter has increased its level of security with a new feature called TweetDeck Teams. This allows users to share Twitter accounts without having to share passwords. This feature allows teams to delegate different access levels to team mates for however long they need. When they are done, you just simply take it away. There is a video on YouTube explaining how the feature works here: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SykSn95WBhk]TweetDeck[/url]. This feature also allows anyone sharing an account to use two-factor authentication. Not only will that send you a one-time login code to a user’s phone but also need you to enter another username and password, adding another layer of protection. Most people who will be using this feature are higher profile targets like CEOs, famous actors/actresses, or anyone who is famous in the public eye. This new feature should hopefully cut down on the amount of Twitter accounts that are compromised.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/pUq7c18.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=981500]Premortal[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2282311]Virule[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Trademark for The Last Guardian Has Been Deserted[/color][/b]\nThe Last Guardian, a game that has been in the works since 2007 and announced officially at E3 2009, has had the trademark for its title unextended by Sony. A screenshot of the documentation of the trademarked name being abandoned can be found [url=http://assets.vg247.com/current//2015/02/the-last-guardian-trademark.jpg]here[/url]. While this may seem like a nail in the coffin for The Last Guardian, Sony confirmed back in August that the game was still in development. It should be noted that Sony has abandoned a trademark for this same title in the past with no effects dealt on development. One possible reason for the abandonment of this trademark would be the introduction of a new title for the game.\n\n[b][color=white]Halo: Master Chief Collection Owners Get Free Month of Xbox LIVE Gold Membership[/color][/b]\nMicrosoft has given a free month of its Xbox LIVE Gold Membership to LIVE members who purchased Halo: Master Chief Collection. This comes as a response to Halo: Master Chief Collection's matchmaking issues that have been faced by players since its release. While multiple patches have been released to solve this issue, it still continues to plague a large amount of players on the game. Xbox frontman Phil Spencer has stated that 343 industries is [url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-halo-dev-100-committed-to-fixing-matchmak/1100-6423878/]\"100% committed\"[/url] to making sure that these issues get resolved.

The gameplay focuses on matching gems in threes to gain and battle Pokemon. You receive five lives and you lose a life every time you don't finish a level under a certain time limit. Lives take 30 minutes each to recharge, allowing you to play again once they are recharged. This type of game, while extremely common on mobile cell phone devices, is relatively rare on the 3DS and other Nintendo platforms. Within the game are microtransactions that concern Jewels that cost £0.89 a piece and can be used to purchase more lives, enabling you to play for longer. \n\n[b][color=white]World's Largest CS:GO Tournament This August[/color][/b]\nThe world's largest Counter Strike: Global Offensive will be hosted this upcoming August by ESL ([i]Electronic Sports League[/i]) in Cologne, Germany. The tournament will be held in the Lanxess arena which can seat up to 15,000 spectators. There will be a total of sixteen teams competing and the winning team will take a whooping $250,000 in prize money home. The $250,000 is funded completely by the ESL instead of the eSports community which regularly funds tournaments like this. Tickets for this event will go up to sale on February 23, 2015.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Date for the Week of February 20, 2015:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]The Order: 1886 - Playstation 4 - February 20, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Dragon Ball Xenoverse - Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC - February 24, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Resident Evil Revelations 2 -- Episode 1 -Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Playstation Vita - February 24, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty - Xbox One, Playstation 4, Wii U,PC - February 25, 2015 \n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Republique Remastered - PC, Macintosh - February 26, 2015 \n[/list]\n\n[align=center]Gaming Video of the Week \n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afqKDqDwxBw[/video] [/align][/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/hkHBi7z.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \n\n[b][color=white]Self Extracting Bee Hives Are the Future of Honey[/color][/b]\nA new invention dubbed Flow Hive allows for honey to be extracted without interfering with bees. The honey is extracted from a hose that taps into the honeycomb directly. It works by having a door seal system inside, with fake honey comb frames that open and close allowing for the honey to be extracted. This is speculated to be more of a hobbyist product in the future rather than a commercial product, but it does seem fun!\n\n[b][color=white]YouTube, for Kids! A New App Is Coming to the Appstore Just for Kids![/color][/b]\nYouTube plans to release a version of YouTube for kids. YouTube for kids will allow parental controls, keep kids from viewing adult content and comments will be disabled from YouTube kids. YouTube plans to release its own television shows on the app as well. It will be on Android only in the beginning, which makes sense as Google owns Android and YouTube.\n\n[b][color=white]Apple Is Being Sued for Stealing Engineers for Its Electric Car[/color][/b]\nApple is being sued for stealing engineers from A123 for their car battery division. There is speculation that A123 is trying to gain money from Apple due to being close to going bankrupt. Either way, the battery engineers were working for a failing company and were offered a job with one of the biggest companies in the world to work on new technology, of course they accepted! The issue is due to competitive malpractice, the two companies could end up competing over the products that A123 engineers had access to when working for A123.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
