The conversation progressed with many members chirping in until two posts caught the eye of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3792412&pid=35583468#pid35583468]#1[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3792412&pid=35584665#pid35584665]#2[/url]. Both of these posts, made by WiFi, were the epitome of the thread--stating that the site had degraded with so many \"wannabes,\" and not enough \"real niggas.\" In response, aside from his numerous posts, Omniscient changed the main banner to [url=http://i.imgur.com/cbA870z.jpg]this[/url], stating \"Real Niggas Welcome.\" If you're interested in seeing some of Omniscient's responses, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3792412&pid=35590017#pid35590017]here[/url] is one of his main posts. The discussion is still ongoing, and all \"real niggas\" are encouraged to show their support. Real Nigga Society Out.\n\n[color=white][b]Online Accounts Gets a Tint of Blue[/b][/color]\nThe [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=291]Online Accounts[/url] section has undergone a major change following a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3789339]thread[/url] posted by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]. Hence forth, only members of the Ub3r member group may start threads. This change also covers the subforum, [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=195]Gamertags[/url]. According to the tweet made about the change, this new restriction aims to cut down on the scams and ban evasion rampant in the section. The tweet may be viewed [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/386615732550631424]here[/url]. This change will make the Online Accounts section a safer place to make purchases in. Keep in mind that L33t and Normal members will still be able to make posts on existing threads.\n\n[color=white][b]HackerCraft Award Now Buyable[/b][/color]\nAfter last week's announcement that the HackerCraft award would soon be released, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has followed through on his promise by [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3783785]declaring the award purchasable[/url]. The award, representing a colorful green creeper face, may now be purchased while on the Hack Forums' official MineCraft server (play.hackercraft.net) by amassing 50,000EM (Economy Money) and entering the command \"/buyaward <UID>\". [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has stated that if you enter the incorrect UID, you will not be refunded, so make sure to double check before pressing enter.\n\n[color=white][b]Marketplace Vouch Indicator Replaced[/b][/color]\nWhen visiting the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=105]Marketplace[/url], you may notice that the vouches counter underneath member's post dates has been replaced with the more useful reputation counter. This will save users time as they will not have to visit profiles in order to view member feedback on a user they plan to deal with. No doubt there will be far less complaints with the current configuration, as the unvarying integer has long been considered to be an annoyance by many. \n\n[color=white][b]Permanently Denied Ub3r? A New Chance Arises![/b][/color]\nFollowing a [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/386642884310470659]tweet[/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], all previously permanently denied Ub3r members are now flushed. This means that you may join the blue team after all, ascending into the highest payed status Hack Forums has to offer. However, there is a catch; you may once again be permanently denied Ub3r. Before hastily stampeding into the direction of [url=http://hackforums.net/ub3rupgrade.php]the upgrade page[/url], think to yourself, \"Am I truly ready?\". The best of luck to those who are affected by this sudden change.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbeJkjATQxoYsl.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][b]Mohatu[/b][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][b]Αlien[/b][/url] have both hit 1000 reputation!

Today we're here with MOTM winner and Mentor; Morchid. Before we begin, is there anybody you'd like to give a special shout out to? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sorry if I give you any bad answers. I'd like to give a shout out to all of the groups I’m currently in (Dynasty, Red Lions, Infamous, Void, Writers and MRT Trainees)  \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] That's quite the list! Why don't you tell us a little bit about what inspired you to sign up on Hack Forums? What made you want to stick around?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] Around the end of January of 2009 a friend and I were both interested in keyloggers. I later found out the Lounge was filled with a lot of interesting threads to read which lead me to stay. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] Wow, you've been here for a while. Do you have any goals you'd like to see yourself accomplish within the next year on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] The only goal I currently have is to become Staff, besides that I can’t think of anything else.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] We believe in you<3! If you could change one thing about Hack Forums, what would it be? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] I appreciate those who create plug-ins and work hard to make Hack Forums simpler, however I believe that it's simple enough as is and there's really not too much I'd change. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] Nice and simple, I like that. So tell us, how exactly did you become a Mentor? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] I believe I got Mentor because Omniscient noticed my progression on Hack Forums. I also believe it's because I took the role of \"Admin\" on the HackerCraft server. I always helped out where I could and as a result of that I believed I was noticed. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] What advice would you give to somebody who has recently signed up on Hack Forums and is looking to contribute? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] I'd start off by telling them to be themselves, an ego will only lead you down the wrong direction. Contribute by writing good content instead of going around giving away money or gifts.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] Very wise. So it's safe to say that you frown upon those who host $0.05-$0.10 giveaways in hopes of gaining some reputation?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] I frown upon all those who give away stuff to internally gain reputation, this is where the reputation system is really messed up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] In the beginning of this interview, you gave a shout out to all of the groups you're currently apart of. Would you mind telling us how you ended up joining all of those groups? Some people have difficulty getting accepted into one group, let alone seven. How'd it all happen? You can be as specific as you'd like.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] I applied for both the Writ3rs and Red lions, for all the others I was invited.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] How has being apart of all those groups effected your career on HF? Have you learned anything specific that has helped you get to where you are now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] Throughout the time I’ve spent on HF I’ve learned a bit. At this current stage I think HF has become a bigger help in my educational life. HF is filled with a tremendous amount of knowledgeable members in the field I’m currently studying. HF is my go to place whenever I need assistance. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Debra Morgan:[/color][/b][/url] That's awesome to hear. Thank you for taking time out of your day to participate in this interview, any final thoughts you'd like to leave us with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=white][b]Morchid:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for the opportunity, I’d also like to thank you for interviewing me.

Today we're interviewing Cloudy. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Well, thanks for the opportunity. I'm glad to be here. I would like to give a shoutout to Saturday, A$AP, Mikey, Clique, Vinnie, Hexicidal, iElement, Soulmate, Marvelous, Hitmarker, Harlem, and anyone else from the \"Crew\" that I forgot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the shoutout and I'm sure the crew will be glad to see their names up there. So tell us what brought you to Hackforums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Well, actually I came from TTG. I've always been a gamer and I really got into forum sites when I was on TTG. This was just another forum that I decided to sign up on and then, you, Soulmate, and Hexicidal all signed up and we became pretty active. I guess, HF just stuck to us.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] The good ol' days, eh? What kept you here as oppose to leaving for another forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] I guess it was just the community and how laid back everything is. I felt like I could post and talk about what I please on here, other sites just didn't have that same feel, know what I mean?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Unlike those boy scouts over at TTG  Anyway, I see you are in a couple different groups. Tell me about how that's affected your HF career.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I've been in almost every gaming group on HF. I'm an avid gamer and I would call myself one of the best on the forum for CoD. It was always my goal to find a \"home\" I guess you could say for groups and overall I think I've found that with Void. Hexicidal is a long time friend of ours and I'm glad to be a part of his group and the family. I guess you could say I've found two homes now on HF. Void and Instinct (#@&%!).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You're a member of Instinct too, eh? So of all the gaming groups you've been a part of (Respawn/Legacy/Skill/Instinct), which has been your favorite?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Uhh, that's actually a really hard choice. I've had a lot of fun in all of them, met a lot of new people, and leard some things. If I had to choose a favorite, I would be stuck between Respawn and Instinct. Respawn was my dream group since they first started on HF. When I finally got in it was a huge accomplishment for me. I miss all the good times with Astonish and everyone in Respawn. I became really close to a few members and had some amazing times. Instinct, on the other hand, has been amazing to me. Vinnie is an old friend from Legacy and I've always been in his gaming groups. I was in both from day one. I've had some pretty fun times with the members of Instinct and I hope we can have some more fun game nights and such. Both of those groups are a tie with me, I really can't choose which is/was better.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Fair enough! So do you have any future plans or goals to reach on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I've reached a lot of my goals thus far on HF. You can see some of them in my feedback thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3616471]here[/url] but I'm nowhere near done with HF. Sometimes it can be a bore of the same old threads, but there is always something new that comes up and keeps me entertained on HF. I've still got some possible plans for \"World Domination\" -Hexicidal on HF, if you know what I mean.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds exciting. So being quite the older member here, I imagine you've seen a lot. What are some of the major changes you've seen occur on Hackforums since you've joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] I can for sure say I've seen a lot but I wouldn't really consider myself an older member. One of the biggest changes I've seen though is the quality of groups. Groups have changed a lot and I think it was for the better. I love the diversity of all of the different groups now. Another thing that has changed is, I feel HF is more of a market than anything else now. I'm not quite sure if it's a good or bad. I feel it can be good because HF has a huge market and I would like to see it stay that way. On the bad side, I feel people only upgrade for the marketplace and they don't appreciate the other benefits of the site.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I agree. Pretty sure we do have the biggest market for a forum. So what other hobbies do you have other than [i]smacking randoms[/i] in Call of Duty? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Well, as a lot of people know, I skateboad. Pretty much everyday or at least when I can. Lately the weather hasn't been in my favour. I've been skating for 7+ years and it's basically my main thing to do. But, when I'm not skating, I'm on HF or Xbox. Normally both for extended periods of time. Yeah, I'm a no life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I skate occasionally as well! So before we go, tell us the history behind your name \"Cloudy\"\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] It all started off as me being a huge Halo 2 and 3 fan. I was big into the MLG pro circut and loved to watch the pros play. Well, It was around the prime of Halo 3 when Cloudy cLoUd played for Instinct and everything was good. He's my favorite player so I figured I would name myself \"Cloudy\" as an alias. The funny thing about it, I'm now on a team (Vinnie's Group) based off of Instinct. [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xc09c7nVo4]Here[/url] is a montage of his.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see, well certainly a unique alias. Well thank you for interview, Cloudy. Do you have any closing statements before I go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=734329][color=white][b]Cloudy:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'd like to say thanks for having me. I really appreciate the opportunity to do this. I'd also like to give a big shout out to the whole news team, you guys do a wonderful job every week with keeping HF updated with the news of the forum. Thanks for all your hard work guys.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] Hey there! Welcome to the 163rd edition of the HF news. Today we're interviewing Harlem, current Writ3r for the tech news! Do you have any shoutouts before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, I got a few. I'd like to shout out to some of the coolest people I've had the opportunity to meet, such as Hitmarker, OptimalSec, Cloudy, Saturday and A$AP. Oh, and the other Writers.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] Speaking of which, how do you like your current position in the Writ3rs?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] I actually enjoy it a lot. Originally when I was applying for it, I was thinking it was going to be a lot easier than it is. Even though it can get a little difficult at times, I enjoy providing the users of the forum with the latest tech news available.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] That's great to hear. Seeing that you've registered all the way back in 2011, what brought you to the forum?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] Originally it was to buy and sell gamertags. I was searching the web for new tags and one of the results was HackForums. That is what got me here, and I have been enjoying it ever since.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] Interesting. Do you think that HF has influenced you in real life? Changed the way that you look at things, perhaps?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] It all depends honestly. I have met some specific users who have changed my outlook on things through our conversations. It has also changed the way in which I make money, somewhat. I still rely on a job for cashflow, but HackForums has provided me a means to make money on the side to have personal spending money.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] Curious, do you have any other hobbies outside of the online world? I know for a fact that you're a gamer and a gamertag seller, so what else?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, gaming is a big part of my life indeed. Other than that I enjoy spending time with my kid most of the time. That takes up most of my day when I am not working. I also enjoy skating whenever I can, as well as fixing up cars.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] Cars! Do you have any cars that you're fond of? 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS perhaps?  I personally like anything that rolls from point A to point B.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] I prefer JDM style cars, so your Nissans, your Hondas, you know all that. I also have a fondness for supercars, like the Lamborghinis and Porsches. Really, anything that has the potential to become faster than it already is.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] Who doesn't like Lamborghinis? I've been wanting the [i]Gallardo Lp 550-2 Spyder[/i] for ages. So, tell me about your achievements or memorable moments during your HF career?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] My biggest achievement on HackForums so far is actually getting to be a part of the Writers. For the longest time I have looked up to the people in the group and wanted to be a part of it. It is like a dream come true, honestly. Other than that, it would have to be making my first $1,000.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] If you could change one thing on HF, what would it be and why would you change it?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] I would change the gaming section, possibly add more subsections to it. Other than that, maybe put groups up for sale again, with strict regulations, and a higher price, to ensure that not everyone could buy one. Not that they weren't already strict, but that's probably it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] I completely agree with you on some of your ideas. Do you have any HF/IRL goals that you'd like to reach in the near future?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] On HF, just to get into more groups and provide help for more members as they show up. I also would like to post more often than I do now. For real life, I am going to college soon and I want to finish and become an engineer. I hope to one day open my own business in the field of engineering.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique[/url]:[/b][/color] I wish you good luck with your future academically and online here at Hackforums. Thank you for taking part in this weeks interview, do you have any final comments to share with us before I go?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]:[/b][/color] I would like to thank you for taking your time to select me and interview me as well. I would like to also say that if any user ever needs any help to let me know. Also, I heard your birthday was on October 6th, so I would like to wish you a Happy Birthday.\n[/spoiler]",

As Rockstar mentioned before the launch, the servers would not be stable due to the large number of players logging in at launch. The title update is now live on Xbox 360 and PS3 and solves many problems that have occurred over the launch. Rockstar Games are now sorting out other bugs and glitches that uses have experienced during online play. You may not see micro transactions just yet, as Rockstar removed them to handle issues before the patch was released. The Social Club was also updated to include online features and statistics. You can view the full list of patch details[url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51522/gta-online-new-title-update-available-today-and-more.html] here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]SimCity Offline Mode[/color][/b]\nMaxis have announced that the company is exploring introducing an offline mode to the game. SimCity had launch problems no one will ever forget that would not allow anyone to play the game. These problems have since been resolved, however many gamers still want an offline mode. Earlier in the year, Electronic Arts sent out a survey in regards to an offline mode, and it came back positive. \"Right now we have a team specifically focused on exploring the possibility of an offline mode,\" Maxis general manager Patrick Buechner said on the SimCity forums. \"I can’t make any promises on when we will have more information, but we know this is something that many of our players have been asking for.\" \"While the server connectivity issues are behind us, we would like to give our players the ability to play even if they choose not to connect,\" he added. \"An offline mode would have the additional benefit of providing room to the modding community to experiment without interfering or breaking the multiplayer experience.\" Maxis should receive a lot of praise from introducing an offline mode to the game.\n\n[color=white][b]Battlefield 4 Beta[/b][/color]\nThe Battlefield 4 Beta is now available for all players across Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. The beta download is 1.56GB, so you may need to clear some hard drive space. Gamers can participate in Conquest or Domination on the Shanghai map (the one with the falling tower) and players can experience new features and elements. Sadly, the beta will end on October 15th, However, the game launches on current-generation consoles on October 29th. You should look into getting the Xbox One or PS4 upgrade for $10 at your local games store.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nMany gamers have been complaining about the graphics on the BF4 beta. However, why are they forgetting this?\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdUv8GnzBCQ[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i5.minus.com/jq7sPEPKMxyEO.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Minecraft Appears in a South Park Episode[/color][/b]\nOn October 2nd, a new episode of South Park aired taking jabs at both Minecraft and murder investigation channels. Just like many (most) other South Park episodes, the show did a good job at picking out cliche stereotypes regarding the game and made sure to joke around a lot about it. The episode made sure to make jokes about the age group that plays it, the game's indirect objective, and the violence that goes on in it. You can watch the full episode on their site.\n\n[b][color=white]The Plastic Texture Pack Has Been Released on 360![/color][/b]\nAs of October 2nd, the Plastic Pack for Minecraft's Xbox 360 edition has been released. As aforementioned, the pack was highly anticipated and thus much hype was made over the release. As of now, though, players are able to view Minecraft in a whole new way-- even simpler. 4J Studios charges only $1 for the pack and it's available in the Xbox Live Marketplace for everyone to buy; it seems like many are taking advantage of such and buying it.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b] [list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=207657][b]Blazeknows[/b][/url] got his very first kill on [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=#0066FF][b]Baghead[/b][/color][/url] and was later raided by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008][color=#0066FF][b]Sudsy[/b][/color][/url].\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]Cody‍[/b][/url] got raided.\n[*] The [url=www.hackercraft.net]HackerCraft website[/url] appears to have been revamped.\n[*] A new PVP arena has been made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=619030][b]iNviZ[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][b]Mohatu[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][b]Morchid[/b][/url].\n[*] The new PVP arena is now accessible by /arena.\n[*] Due to a mishap caused by AFK'ing a mob grinder, the mobs per chunk have been limited.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url] found an exploit in /trade which enabled users to dupe their items and it was later patched by Omni.[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Other popular threads[/color][/b]:[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3783785][b]HackerCraft Award Open[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1]Omniscient[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3784082][b]Compilation of good tips and builds!

Being that the server's only gamemode is such, developers and administrators of the server went out of their way to make the server special with plenty of unique features.

She was shot when she stopped her car and attempted to flee on foot. A one year old child was found in the car and was taken to a local hospital. The child is in good condition.\n\n[color=white][b]United States Government Shuts Down for First Time in 17 Years[/b][/color]\nThe US Congress was not able to come to an agreement regarding this years' budget, leading to the first federal furlough in nearly two decades. The partial shutdown began Tuesday morning and includes all non-essential federal staff and services, including parks, national monuments and online services. Republicans were hoping that the threat of a shutdown would be enough to convince the Democrats into allowing a hold on key Obamacare elements.\n\n[color=white][b]FBI Forced Lavabit to Hand Over SSL Keys[/b][/color]\nRecently released documents, unsealed by a court judge during a hearing for Texas-based secure email provider Lavabit, revealed that the United States FBI forced the service's owner to hand over his site's SSL key. The SSL key would allow anyone to read the encrypted communications between users. With this revelation, computer security researchers theorize that this is standard practice for the government. Amusingly, Lavabit founder Ladar Levison complied with the court order by printing out the 2,560 character key in size 4 font over 11 pages in a difficult to read font. The court wasn't amused and demanded an electronic copy. In return Levison closed the service, rendering any surveillance attempts moot.\n\n[color=white][b]China Military Occupies Rural Tibetan Village Who Refused To Fly Chinese Flag[/b][/color]\nIn 2011 China implemented the “nine haves” initiative to assimilate the Tibet Autonomous Region into mainland China. Part of this program requires each Tibetan to fly a Chinese flag over their house, and many rejected this plan. In response, on September 27th, “thousands” of Chinese troops occupied the town to enforce the policies. The military move was in anticipation for China's National Day (the Chinese equivalent to the United States' Independence Day) that was celebrated last Tuesday, October 1st. An estimated 40 individuals have been taken into custody for refusing to comply with the Chinese initiative.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i6.minus.com/jbhQVIqSLkn4zV.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Instagram To Get Ads Soon[/b][/color]\nThe photo sharing social network, Instagram, is soon looking to start putting ads into your feeds. Most users seemed a bit worried by this causing the company to respond. In a statement, they had mentioned that the ads will be placed in between your friends’ photos and videos and also said that you could hide them and let notify them that you didn’t like that particular ad. This update is planned to roll out over the next few months.\n\n[color=white][b]New Smartphone Costs $179 Off-Contract[/b][/color]\nMost users nowadays are stuck trying to choose between big brand-name phone companies and that being said, Blu Products may have something for you. The phone is the Blu Studio 5.5 and is an all-around basic Android phone. The specs aren't anything to be amazed by as it has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 4GB of expandable memory, and dual sim slots. The resolution is probably the worst part being that it's on 854 x 480. If you aren't looking to pay an arm and a leg for your phone, this is for you. \n\n[color=white][b]Apple Supposedly Acquires Cue, Teases Future Agenda Features In iOS[/b][/color]\nIf you have been using iOS 7, then you will have noticed that Apple already has an agenda-like feature in the notification tray. There may be a new agenda feature coming soon, though as the tech giant reportedly acquires the small app developer that goes by the name of \"Cue.\" Cue had used their technology to create plans based on your email (among other personal data and then have them displayed them to you.) There is no telling at this point if it will be used, seeing as Apple has not confirmed or denied as of yet.\n\n[color=white][b]Online Black Market Shut Down.[/b][/color]\nThis past week, there has been tons of news going around about how the Silk Road, a large online black market, had been shut down. The site itself was hosted on the Tor network, which is a somewhat like a VPN and allows the user to surf in complete anonymity. It sold a variety of things such as drugs, forged documents, assassinations and normal household things. The exchanging was all done in Bitcoins and the item was shipped to you or the service you requested was done. The owner of the site, known as Dread Pirate Roberts (or DPR by some of the users of his former site) was arrested because of his involvement with the site. After he had been arrested, the site was taken down and an official FBI seizure notice was put up. Most people are speculating that one of the main reasons he got caught was that he allowed users to email him at his real Gmail address. The Silk Road is now long gone, but the concept of illegal markets is not. There will undoubtedly be clones popping up in place of the Silk Road.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i2.minus.com/jNSBPkIFfPylp.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Kendrick Lamar Disses Drake[/b][/color]\nKendrick took a jab at Drake in a snippet of his 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards cypher, calling him a \"sensitive rapper.\" Can't really argue with that as Drake has become more of a singer now. Drake completely brushed off Kendrick's original diss on \"Control\" stating, \"It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was,\" Drake told Billboard back in August. \"I know good and well that Kendrick's not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\" That's not all though, earlier this month, during an interview with Hot 97's Angie Martinez in New York, Drake addressed Kendrick's diss once again, stating, \"It just wasn't real to me. I saw him after that and it was just like love, so it's like was that real or was that for the people? Those were harsh words, you can't just say that and see me like, 'Yeah, man, what's up,' pretending like nothing ever happened. That's not real.\" K.Dot shot back saying, \"Whenever folks like myself question Drake’s place in rap, his supporters bring up “5 AM in Toronto” and “Stay Schemin’” which are great examples of the former [i]actor’s[/i] lyrical ability.\" Ouch.\n\n[b][color=white]Justin Bieber Starts Countdown To 'Heartbreaker'[/color][/b]\nAny Bieber fans out there? I'm certainly not one. Starting on October 7, Justin Bieber will kick off a series he's calling Music Mondays with the long-awaited single, \"Heartbreaker.\" JB tweeted the news out and in matter of seconds it got 138,991 retweets and 81,963 favorites. To those who don't know, Bieber is doing this to promote his new documentary, \"Believe.\" His plan calls for a new song to be released at midnight every Sunday for ten weeks. Back in July, Justin Bieber posted the first line  of the song on Instagram, \"Ooh, girl, I got a secret place that we can go/ 'Cause girl, I really want to be alone/ And, baby, nobody else got to know,\" he sang on the R&B-influenced track that has a \"sexy\" groove (according to MTV.) The tease for \"Heartbreaker\" has been going on for months now, including the release of the cover art back in June which Bieber posted on Instagram and Twitter, it consisted of a crumbling purple heart . The Biebs, weirdly enough, still has a strong fanbase even after his spit on fans and pissed in a bucket... not forgetting he also spit on Clinton's face.\n\n[b][color=white]Lorde's 'Royals' #1[/color][/b]\nLorde officially became the youngest artist in a quarter century to have the #1 song on Billboard's Hot 100. Her song, \"Royals\" which mocks singers like Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus is actually getting a lot of a praise from Katy Perry and twerking monster; I don't think the two really know what the song is about. Considering the anti-affluence sentiments of her hit \"Royals,\" the rare pop song addresses the vapidity of the \"pop\" genre itself. Which is why its success is somewhat shocking. Either way, congrats to Lorde for being daring and courageous enough to go against many of these \"pop\" artists. Keep in mind, she's only 16 and already taking the world by storm without twerking *cough*.\n\n[b][color=white]Jury Rules Michael Jackson's Concert Company Not Responsible In Singer's Death[/color][/b]\nA.E.G Live, Michael Jackson's concert promoter, was quite lucky to win this one. The Jackson estate had sued A.E.G for killing MJ by hiring doctor Conrad Murray. The trial lasted about five months and on October 2nd the jury finally ruled that A.E.G was not to blame in the death of Michael. Mrs. Jackson argued the doctor A.E.G had hired was unfit and that they were pushing Michael past his breaking point and forcing him to work harder. According to The New York Times, Mrs. Jackson was seeking $1.5 billion in damages, but since the jury did not agree that Murray was unfit, the company, the second-largest in its industry, is not liable. The doctor is currently serving time in jail after he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter two years ago. The Jackson estate obviously disappointed with the outcome has yet to decide on weather or not to appeal the verdict.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i5.minus.com/jU1waKJxxPlGb.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nQuitting. I'm super tired at the moment, and after beginning this section four different times on different subjects, I have realized it's time to throw in the towel. However, by throwing in the towel, I have found my topic. You'll always hear from people that \"winners never quit,\" but I disagree. In some instances, that quote may hold truth, but in general, I find it to be false. While the main idea behind it is to promote perseverance, one must understand when a pursuit must be dropped or a goal altered. Not everyone can succeed at everything they do, so be aware of the time and effort you put into an area of failure and re-evaluate its worth.",
