BackTrack is a Linux distribution, featuring a plethora of tools built right into the operating system. It is often used for penetration testing, with its strength coming from the fact that its tools are built in; it is often used as a live CD, rather than being installed on the host machine. This put BackTrack on the map, and allowed its activity to sky rocket; however, after many changes and its connotation shifting toward more of a \"skid\" usage, its activity declined. BackTrack has been the go-to operating system for hackers for years, but recently the activity surrounding the OS has begun to die down. BackTrack was officially re-branded as Kali, but this didn't revive the section here on Hack Forums. Following this, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] decided it was best to remove the section in its entirety, and add respective thread prefixes in the Linux section.\n\n[color=white][b]SRPP Ub3r & L33t Only[/color][/b]\nThe [b][url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=128]Science, Religion, Philosophy, and Politics[/url][/b] section has just had a major crackdown! With a landmark decision, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has decided to impose new member restrictions. Something we very often only see within the bounds of the marketplace here on Hack Forums has spread to a regular section; only L33t and Ub3r members can now post threads and replies in the SRPP section. This restriction is put in place to severely cut down on the amount of trolling. This section, which is often associated with a permeating sense of trolling, low quality, and other undesirable traits is now hopefully in the works of being transformed into what the section could potentially be. With members wanting something like this for years now, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] says \"Don't bother thanking me. I know you're thinking 'oh finally thank heaven'. / You're welcome.\" Even after this, there was clearly a rejuvenated and thankful persona from that section, as well as one of the primary advocates for the change, the Hack Forums group Void. You can read more on the subject [b][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4095223]here[/url][/b].\n\n[color=white][b]No More Report Discussion[/color][/b]\nAbout a month back, the head of the News, [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url][/b] decided that all relevant discussion on the [b][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3673692]weekly report[/url][/b] thread was allowed. Subsequently, many people did begin to discuss various things in the weekly report, and its pros became apparent quite quickly; however, after a few weeks, the discussion started to subside and be replaced with trolling, flaming, and unrelated replies. This lasted for a few weeks, with Sir dealing with the majority of the bad replies, but at last it became truly a problem and is therefore now prohibited. Discussion is no longer encouraged nor welcomed. All posts which aren't reports will be removed. The News team thanks everyone who reports the current events happening each and every week!

How's it going, Gary? Any shoutouts before we start?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. Quite a few actually. Shoutout to Bandors, Diiaz, Saturday, Clique, Cyber CEO, featuredbmx, Abide, Krew, and Acroz.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Dang, Clique is my homeboi. I'm sure they'll be happy to see their name on this edition. So before we start, is your name actually Gary?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, my name is actually Gary.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Alrighty, Gary. Well how did you find out about the wonderful world of HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] Well. I came across it when I wanted to get into RATing. My friend said that he bought a crypter from HackForums.net and I was like never heard of it, so I signed up and made my first thread asking for a crypter, which I did get recommended \"File Protector\". WORST. PURCHASE. EVER. Turns out the product was backdoored and I was never refunded.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So you're pretty well known around the forums as a troll, correct? What do you think of that label?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] I'm known around the forums? That surprises me, it doesn't bother me because people don't really know me. If they knew who I was then they wouldn't label me as a \"troll\". When I'm not \"trolling\" I'm usually helping out newer members with life problems or sticking out for them. I wouldn't care if my account got closed because I was defending a new member. If this were to happen I went out with a bang.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's certainly honorable. So it's safe to say you're misunderstood. Guys, leave Gary alone. He has a tender heart. So you joined for ratting. Why did you stay?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] That's the question I love answering. Here is why I stayed. Well orignally I only had attentions of buying a Crypter thats all but for some reason the community stood out to me in a way that made me want to stay. In the beginning I was like \"oh these guys are pretty rude\" but then I found a bunch of super nice members like Tibit, mad, 630, Reggie, Autopost, you and bunch more that I cannot remember right now for some reason, if I were to join hackforums around this time I wouldn't want to stay reason being is that almost everyone especially L33Ts now act like total dicks to newer members meanwhile the UB3Rs are defending them, it used to be the other way around. I don't really know how to explain why I stayed just something about the community that got to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I know I can speak for everybody when I say the golden days (2011-2012) as I remember them, were the best. I truly was an experience to be on HackForums back then. You joined in 2013 so maybe you can even speak on how the forum has changed since then?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] It has changed a lot. From how people act to what people expect. Now a days people expect you to have very High Quality threads especially from newer members who make threads. I've seen L33Ts go out of their way just to go tell regular members that their thread isn't \"HQ\" and needs to have 35 paragraphs. Staff is getting strict on spam which I love *cough people in the UML cough* and Omniscient is always trying to do his best even with people still complaining about what he does. What has been brought up a lot is that the qualifications for ub3r aren't as strict as they used to be and practically everyone is being accepted. Someone brought up that a member with 200 posts and 12 rep got accepted compared to Goodies who posts a lot of HQ threads and has been denied 5 times.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] At the end og the day it's all Omni's choice who he wants upgraded and who he doesn't. I agree with you completely on the quality thing. People try so hard to be 'HQ' that they forget to be themselves. Which brings me to my next topic of groups. They've changed tremendously over the years. What's your viewpoint on them now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] Groups are just dumb now and are great way to earn money. For example Innovation doing buy-ins then kicking out members. Groups aren't has HQ as they used to be. To be honest the only HQ groups in my eyes are the following not in order 143, Complexity, The Empire and Red Lions. All these other groups on the forums don't do jackshit and are basically \"If you're my friend you can join, but if one member from my friends list hates you we all automatically hate you and will gang rep you\". If I had the choice to be in any group and never be kicked no matter what happens to them it would have to be The Empire.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Let's agree to disagree on some of those names. Personally, having been in almost every group on this forum, the ones I'm in now are the only ones who stick out to me. It's all about the money these days, and not for the better of the forum, which is sad. So your one year anniversary is coming up. Have anything planned? Perhaps a feedback thread? You're definitely very open with your opinions.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] As of this time I have nothing planned I will probably make a Feedback thread when I have the chance but I'm very busy with In real life stuff; packing my stuff. If I were to make a feedback thread then I'd have to take at least 4 hours out of that day just to type and correct errors.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Packing? Are you moving out or what's up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'll just say it. Parents are getting divorced and I'm moving out with my mom. I had a choice but I'm just sick of how my \"dad\" treats my mom so we're moving out and she's getting a divorce.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's rough. But let's end this interview on a positive note. Favorite song?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] Lady Killers by G-Eazy  ft. Hoodie Allen, this song has over 2,000 plays on my iTunes library. I've been a fan of G-Eazy for 3 years now and I must say he is a great rapper. He's on tour right now and he will be stopping by my city but it's a 19+ concert which is erhmahgersh.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm a Skizzy Mars fan. He's done a few songs with G-Eazy. G-Eazy is actually touring in Portland (Or maybe Eugene, OR) and I was planning on going since I haven't been to a concert since Odd Future in 2013.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=white][b]Gary:[/b][/color][/url] The last concert I went to was in 2006. He will be coming to Vancouver, BC @ Rogers Arena!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#e36969][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's sick. I hope you get to go. Thanks for stopping by and letting me interview you, Gary.

Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF news. How are you doing on this fine weekend?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] Well I am doing wonderful, thank you for asking. Although work has been rough for me I am continuing to stay strong and let the good times roll.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's how it should be, my man. Any shoutouts before we continue?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] I would like to give a shout out to some of the friends I have made in my journey through Hack Forums. Those members are White Light, Goodies, Anime Libera, Vitafortis, and a few others. Those are just the ones I could name right off.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Well, hello to them. (Hi anima!) So -- what brought you here, man? Referred by someone? Or did you wind up here on your own?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] Well back in 2011 a friend of mine told me about the site, I joined and just lurked for a bit before leaving. It wasn't until 2012 that I stumbled accross the site again during a search to help me out with a batch script. I liked the section and became an active member and I have slowly begun to spread out. I realized there was more to the site and just decided to stay.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad that you decided to stay. Did you ever get into the hacking scene at all when you first arrived here?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] I have, when I was a young child I began studying different types of hacking and have learned some more about it from HF. I would call myself an intermediate hacker. I would not even begin to call myself advanced or a pro by any means. I am still learning though and I feel that to be the best you will always be learning more.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interesting.  So -- what does the real Renrioku do? Away from the screen. \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] I am a Dish Network Service technician. I go to peoples houses to install and troubleshoot both satellite TV and internet service.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] How's that? Get any pissed off customers because they don't have internet? I know the feel.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] It is actually quite a bit of fun, for me at least. I have seen some really pissed off customers, but usually by the time I leave they are happy again with their service working again.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Well, that's good! What do you think of HF? You've been here since late '11. Tell us!\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] I think it is a wonderful community with a lot to offer. It like any forum has its fair share of trolls and it has a lot of friendly members. Not only that but it has so many sections that almost every topic I could think of is covered. I have seen many changes in my time, everything from rule changes to theme changes. I think the site is only getting better though and Omni is doing a great job.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Agreed. What does your username represent? Is there any special meaning to it?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] I was once told that my username needed to be something unique, something that only I would use. It was just a random name that I though of one day and it has a nice ring to it. I now use the name for everything. I have even considered getting it copyrighted.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Ren-Ri-Oku, right? (Is that how you say it?) It's pretty dang cool mang. I like it. Do you see yourself being on this site in the long run? Or do you think that you'd grow out it?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041725]RenRioku™[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes that is how you say it. I see myself being here for a long time to come, I love the site and have no reason to leave.

Today I'm here with the member Vegas. How are you doing tonight Vegas? Do you have any shotouts you'd like to make?\n[/color] [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm trying to balance partying and recovering from partying. If anyone, the entirety of the Red Lions. They all have my love. Clique, Chowder (wherever he is), Soulzeh, Genuine, iHydra, Lemur and Seer. Yeee.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color]  Awesome. So, I've seen you around all of the time, but I don't know that much about you or your interests. What are they?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] I guess.. gaming is sort of my background if I had to sum it up. I play a few fighting games competitively and I'm currently going to school for programming and graphic design until I decide on another school. Aside from getting baked and playing games, I just like to enjoy my days as much as I can with my friends and family. And my doggie. (:\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] Very cool, which languages are you currently studying? Any idea what you'd like to do when you're older?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, I'm actually just starting the graphic design bit and haven't progressed to the language learning semester. Soon though, I'll be learning fundamental C.\nAt the moment, I don't really have any idea what I'll end up doing, but my hopes are that it will have something to do with progression of competitive gaming. There is a great future in it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color]  That's for sure. Gaming has truly taken over the world. What's your favourite platform to game on and why?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] I think PC takes the cake on that one. Console mechanics may be more comfy now and then but the experience will never be the same. I could brag about the graphics or the mature community but really it comes down to versatility for me. I can play just about anything that isn't exclusive to a current-gen console, and I have one of those for when I need it d:\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] I agree with you on that. You've been gaming for awhile, but have you friends? Do you still play with the same people you went to high school with? Dd you ever play with them? Do you feel COD is dying?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] Haha, I definitely have friends. In fact, the 5 people I hung out with most in high school are still my closest friends. We all have consistent tournaments on Blazblue, Persona 4A, Guilty Gear, Soul Calibur 4/5, Mortal Kombat 9 and Naruto S:UNS3. CoD is not what it used to be. I don't think it is dying by any means, but it may have lost some luster. With things like Titanfall and Destiny coming into the mix, I think Infinity Ward may have a lot to worry about if they don't start thinking more innovatively.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] What was your favourite Call of Duty, and what did you think of Call of Duty WaW? I ask because that was always my favourite.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] My favorite has always been Modern Warfare. It was newest to me at that point, so when I was diving in, it was really a refreshing experience rather than trying to do something better than last time. World at War is honestly pretty underrated. The gameplay was a reasonable step up from 4, and that's not even including zombies, which was a simplistic masterpiece and was in my opinion a mistake on Infinity Ward's part to drop.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] I like you already. So, in terms of HF do you have any goals you'd like to see yourself accomplish in the near future?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] Nothing in the short term, really. Just want to keep being a positive asset. Turning frowns upside down and whatnot (;\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] If you could change one thing about HF, what would it be and why?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] I wouldn't mind seeing a more engaging form of interaction for all the members onsite. A little competitive game on each forum or something. Sometimes you can get on here and just not find a sweet spot. I find myself leaving immediately after coming here now and then and if something consistent like that were in place, it would probably keep me around even more.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] Fair enough. So how long have you been in the Red Lions user group? How are you liking it.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] They invited me on Christmas a few years back. The Lions are definitely the most enjoyable collective of people I've met online. They were super welcoming when I joined, and the sense of community in it is just fantastic. We aren't really supposed to talk about anything sub-forum related but rest assured, it is a place of good vibes.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/url][/b][/color] Awesome, well thanks for joining me for this interview. If you have any closing statements you'd like to make, by all means go for it.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url]:[/b][/color] Sure thing. Yeah man, party hard, study harder.[/spoiler]",

One can only guess this engineer is talking about their 2010 hit, Red Dead Redemption. If this new game is in development, it is likely that it’ll be seeing a release around Fall of next year. Personally, I would love to see a second installment of Red Dead Redemption; the first one is still one of my favorite games by the company.\n\n[color=white][b]GTA V: Business Update Released![/b][/color]\nRockstar has been releasing periodic updates to GTA V, many of which include new weapons and vehicles. This latest update adds some new cars within the Legendary Motorsport roster. These new cars are the Albany Alpha, Dinka Jester, and Grotti Turismo R. There are also new horn sounds and wheel smoke options in the latest update, which will be great for races. A new airplane has been added, the Vestra luxury jet. For those that have gotten bored of the game’s guns, two new firearms were added. The “Heavy Pistol” and “Special Carbine” have been added. New business-style clothing comes with this update as well, which gives it the name “business update.” On another note, fourteen new jobs have been added to the game, most of which were designed for the new additions. These are just a few of the new additions, you can check out the full list of additions [url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52202/The-Business-Update-for-GTA-Online-Is-Now-Available]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Ubisoft Already Planning for Assassin Creed’s End[/b][/color]\nThough they don’t plan on it any time soon, the studio responsible for Assassin’s Creed, Ubisoft, has said they’ve got everything planned for the end of the series, whenever that may happen. Ashraf Ismail, developer and director for Ubisoft, explains: \"We have an idea of where the end is, what the end is. But of course Yves [Guillemot, Ubisoft's overall boss] announced we are a yearly title, we ship one game a year. So depending on the setting, depending on what fans want, we’ve given ourselves room to fit more in this arc. But there is an end.” Ubisoft has a way of hinting at future changes and plot details in the next game. For example, the main character of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag was hinted at in Assassin’s Creed 3.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbb0ATvLAZvxfB.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft Realms-- Now in 1.7.5[/b][/color]\nThough the much-anticipated addition to the game is only available in Sweden for the time being, a working version has finally been released and implemented into the game. Allowing users to use custom mini-games from players and servers such as SethBling, Vechs, and Hypixel, a survival aspect still remains. Upon switching to and from mini-games, the survival server is saved as-is. For more information on the feature, watch Jeb's video in the spoiler below.\n\n[spoiler=][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ5fHoawp6U[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft-- the Movie?[/color][/b]\nAfter [url=https://twitter.com/notch/status/439164234099073024]a surprising Tweet[/url] from Notch, one of Minecraft's lead developers, not many have known what to think in light of the news. Warner Bros, the producers of \"The Lego Movie,\" have been working with Notch in order to make a Minecraft movie. Though there isn't quite a plot to the game itself, one can only assume that something will be put together in order for some actual meaning to be made. Nevertheless, the news remains a leak as of right now and thus does not include much information other than the fact itself. An estimated release date alongside further details can be expected for release very soon.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nFirst and foremost, this section of the Minecraft news isn't to cover every waking detail that goes on in HackerCraft. The section, rather, is only to state observations regarding the server's activity or news worthy of recognition. The HackerCraft News in the past was successful for a few weeks, but became too much to handle given the lack of activity and attention it was receiving. This being said, here is this week's HackerCraft News:\n\nThe spawn has been redone this week, and a nether-type theme has been implemented. The face of the old spawn, then (same location) has been turned into a casino and the shop has been moved down a few levels. Given such renovations, there's certainly more room to get stuff done in the spawn.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]Jadecraft[/color][/b]\nReady to PvP with your friends and factions? If so, prepare to indulge in a server owned and operated by some of HackForum's very own members, alongside a community of awesome people.

The country comprises a continental mainland and numerous islands in the Caribbean Sea. It borders Guyana to the east, Brazil to the south, and Colombia to the west. The government of Venezuela is a socialist government and has had multiple uprising since it's official labeling in 1999. Opposition leaders are taking a common \"regime-change\" strategy in which it's people start riots and then they put the blame on the oppressive government as the cause.  The latest official numbers have eight confirmed deaths of opposition protesters, but no evidence that these were a result of efforts by the government to crush dissent. At least two pro-government people have also been killed, and two people on motorcycles were killed (one beheaded) by wires allegedly set up by protesters. Eleven of the 55 people currently detained for alleged crimes during protests are security officers.\n\n[color=white][b]Crimea breaks ties with Ukraine[/b][/color]\nCrimea is a region that is typically considered the pro-Russian area of Ukraine, and just this week Russian soldiers have invaded the area to \"bring peace to the region.\" Ukraine has considered this a direct invasion to their country and has activated all military forces, causing extremely high tension in the area. On the fourth of March, 2014 Crimea has officially broken ties with Ukraine, and asked all soldiers to leave their bases and urges them to join sides with the new Crimean government. The money that has been supporting the new government is from unknown sources and the separation hearing will be held later this month.\n\n[color=white][b]Kim Jong-Un At It Again[/b][/color]\nThirty-three North Koreans face execution after being charged with attempting to overthrow the regime, the incident that led to this charge was them working closely with a missionary. They had received money to set up 500 underground churches, and they will be put to death at the State Security Department. Missionary Kim Jung-wook was arrested and jailed last year for allegedly trying to establish underground churches. Last week he held a press conference at which he apologized for committing \"anti-state\" crimes and appealed for his release from North Korean custody.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jTIISqnQV7AMM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Steam Family Sharing Exits Beta[/b][/color]\nOne of the biggest problems with owning games digitally is that you cannot loan them to friends. Valve has been looking to fix this with Steam Family Sharing, which has just come out of beta. This means you can now authorize another user that you trust to have access to your games, and they may install them at any time. For example, users can ask friends who have a game to allow them to try it, before purchasing it themselves.\n\n[color=white][b]Instacube Shipping Out With Support For Video[/b][/color]\nMany people have already purchased an Instacube, and have been waiting for it to begin the shipping process. These people have to wait no more, seeing as the device is now shipping. The Instacube itself is a large box, where you can load your Instagram photos. It acts as a photo frame, using the pictures from your feed. The device's late shipping is primarily due to last-minute changes to add video support. Soon enough, there will be support for other services as well.\n\n[color=white][b]HTC Shutting Down Movie Streaming Service In UK[/b][/color]\nOver the past few months, HTC has been slowly pulling the plug on its Watch service in Europe. The most recent is going to be the Watch store in the UK, which is closing on March 31st. This means that any purchased movies will have to be transferred to a different device in order to be accessible from there on out. HTC has not elaborated on these decisions, but it is expected that the shutdowns are due to Netflix's domination of the streaming scene.\n\n[color=white][b]Galaxy S5 Coming To Boost and Virgin Mobile[/b][/color]\nSprint has announced that Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile will both carry the Samsung Galaxy S5 when it is released in the second quarter of the year. This could bring an end to low-end smartphones on prepaid plans. There have been no prices set by either carrier yet, but it will most likely be set at a high price, seeing as it is prepaid. The Galaxy S5 is expected for worldwide launch in April.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j2bNJXw7KAGGS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Premiere of A$AP Rocky f/ Gesaffelstein \"In Distress\"[/color][/b]\nA$AP Rocky, who was MIA for a while, has finally dropped a new track with the help of French producer Gesaffelstein (real name Mike Levy). Gesaffelstein had a pretty big year in 2013, releasing his critically-acclaimed LP Aleph and working with Kanye on Yeezus. The song will be featured on the soundtrack for an upcoming movie called \"Divergent\", coming to theaters on March 21; however, the soundtrack is coming earlier on March 11.  \n\n[b][color=white]Kendrick Lamar Finally Responds To Macklemore's Grammy Text[/color] [/b]\nRemember that text Macklemore sent Kendrick Lamar after the Grammys for winning hip-hop awards that many people argued should have gone to Kendrick? Drake even said it was \"wack as fuck\". Well, after weeks, he has finally responded saying \"Macklemore is such a genuine dude.\", also mentioning that he was surprised by the message. Adding \"However it panned out, I wish him much success. He touched people's souls, and no one can take that away. Really, the whole Grammy moment was incredible. Not everyone gets that shot.\" Great attitude overall and K-Dot even stated he had moved on from the incident and has bigger plans ahead. \n\n[b][color=white]Coachella 2014 Lineup Announced[/color][/b]\nConfirmed artists include The Replacements, Neutral Milk Hotel, Beck, The Knife, Disclosure, Queens of the Stone Age, Pharrell, Lana Del Rey, Nas, Bryan Ferry, Skrillex, MGMT, Haim, Girl Talk, The Afghan Whigs, Chromeo, Sleigh Bells, Neko Case, Lorde, Solange, Chvrches, Ty Segall, Chance the Rapper, Darkside, Broken Bells, Waxahatchee, Foxygen, Blood Orange, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, A$AP Ferg, Mogwai, Dum Dum Girls, Washed Out, Holy Ghost!, Superchunk, Duck Sauce, Classixx, The Dismemberment Plan, Warpaint, Factory Floor, Shlohmo, Wye Oak, The Internet, Empire of the Sun, Jagwar Ma, Flume, Future Islands, Motörhead, and many others.

The newly reunited OutKast (who will also be headlining this year's OVO Fest in Toronto) and Arcade Fire will headline and be the openers for the festival. Check out the official Coachella poster [url=http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/BdgjC7bCMAA3mub.jpg-large.jpeg?wmode=transparent]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Snoop Dogg's New Mixtape \"That's My Work Vol. 3\"[/b][/color]\nThe 42-year-old Long Beach legend just released a new mixtape, \"That's My Work Vol. 3\". The 20-song project is hosted by DJ Drama and includes guest appearances from some of Snoop's closest friends and from the days of vintage hip-hop. Some names include Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Warren G, and more. The project also includes the recently released \"What's Your Pleasure\" and \"Cadillacs.\"\n\n[color=white][b]First iHeart Radio Music Awards to Air on NBC[/b][/color]\niHeart Radio is looking to join the competition in the \"ever-growing vat of music awards ceremonies\". Not many details have been released yet, but USA Today has stated \"On May 1 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, NBC will air the first iHeart Radio Music Awards (8 11 p.m. ET/PT), which will be based on its new chart and fan votes. iHeart's new chart is based on Mediabase, a chart that tallies airplay.. there will be 13 categories, with generally 10 nominees each, across all genres of music. Fans will whittle down the nominees to five, and the finalists will be announced on March 26 at the iHeart Radio Theater in Los Angeles.\" Looking forward to seeing how it will turn out.\n\n[b][color=white]Fennesz: \"The Liar\", From New Album Bécs[/color][/b]\nThis was actually sent to me by a member, and was asked to be put on the Music News. You can listen to it [url=https://soundcloud.com/editionsmego/fennesz-the-liar-emego-165]here[/url]. Fennesz is a Viennese electronic producer, and I must admit that [url=http://gyazo.com/524303c326982ceeda8a700eea5d4d52]his album art[/url] is quite impressive. \n\n[color=white][b]Map Shows Each State's Most Popular Music Not Popular Anywhere Else[/b][/color]\nI doubt it is entirely accurate, but you can check out this map [url=http://www.spin.com/sites/all/files/styles/style820_546/public/140226-distinctive-artist-state-map.jpg]here [/url] and judge its accuracy for yourself. \"The Echo Nest is one of the myriad behind-the-scenes technology companies that power the operations we know by more familiar names such as Spotify, Beats Music, or Pandora\" according to Spin.com. Nonetheless, it's fun to look at it. \n\nPlease tell me what genre news YOU would like to informed about! HF is very diverse, and it is difficult for me to guess your musical tastes.

I find it somewhat akin to hosting \nit in a conflict-riddled country, such as Syria, though perhaps \nless extreme. Though the anti-gay legislation was somewhat \npushed aside for the majority of the games, it decidedly \ncaused some uproar. Not to mention, the venue seemed \nentirely unprepared to host the Olympics, and possibly a \nbit surprised. As for the games themselves, I thought they \nwent relatively well, less the controversy surrounding the \njudging of the figure skating competitions. However, I \nthoroughly hope the 2016 Summer Games, and the following \n2018 Winter Games will be run considerably more smoothly, \nand in a more politically-conscious location.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1088934][i]-Crypto™[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the \nSochi Olympic games as I should have, but I probably \nwatched it more than most people. The competition \nthat I was really into was the Hockey competition, \nprobably because I'm an avid NHL fan, I love the Boston \nBruins and the San Jose Sharks. Though there was only \none player from both teams that played for my home \ncountry, I cheered them on along with the other countries \nthat had a majority of players from those teams. Despite \nthere being a complete \"choke\" on behalf of my country, \nI think the competition was great and wouldn't change it. \nI'll continue to watch the Summer Olympics and will \ncontinue to cheer for my home country.

It also got me interested in a few of the games \nthat they played and I hope one day that the Winter Olympics \nwill be valued just as much as the Summer ones.

I prefer the \nSummer Olympics, but this year was pretty insane. Considering \nthe fact that that this is the first time Russia has hosted the \nOlympics since the breakup of the USSR, I think Russia went \nall out with it. Even though it was a great show that was put \non,, it's safe to say that they definitely spent a bit too much \non everything, considering the fact that Sochi is still a \ndeveloping city.
