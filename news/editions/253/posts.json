This has been put to a stop after a suggestion thread by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=805825][color=#EFEFEF][b]- Sam -[/b][/color][/url] which included a huge compilation of threads violating the already-existing PayPal discussion rule within the last 30 days. To combat this, a new rule has been introduced to the section, reading: “4. No topics or discussion on breaking PayPal TOS or fraud”.

How are you doing today?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] I'm very well. Hello to all of HF :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Are there any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Well, Omni, and the Staff for not only keeping the site running so smoothly as it does given the constant strains given, but providing and continuing to expand on services.\n\nAll my buddies in the R.A.T. section, Business, The now retired Joker, and everyone else who helps in keeping the content HQ.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Nice. Are you a frequent user of the RAT section? Have you created any projects or anything like that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Not recently.  When the DotNet Architecture came out I sort of put my coding glove aside. I had some projects of my own, mostly Visual Studio 6 based suite.  However, I took a larger focus towards networking at the end of the day. It has however become a consideration again, I have started reading up on newer code standards\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] How did you get into it to begin with? Were you self-taught or did you have to take classes to learn it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] That is kind of a bomb of a question.\nI started out in the early 80's with a C64, obviously very limited, but cool none the less, I could play frogger, we eventually got a IBM clone 386, which is where my true learning began, I got the fundamentals of DOS and command line structure from these early years.\n\nHowever it was not until the early 90's where I had my own machine to utilize at my own free will, and a dial up connection.  My interest in computers was always there, but it was not until I actually got infected with, what I later determined to be Sub 7. The guy totally trolled the hell out of me to the point I had to physically pull the telephone cable from the jack to disconnect. I sat back and staring at my machine thought to myself \"I have to know how they did that\"\n\nIt was at that point I took an interest in networking, and above all network security. I started with VIral code. Through years of trial, lots of error and the rest, I got a grasp on how a virus works, and its central designs. From there, it was just a matter of expansion, and by this age, I was now ready to attend College. I took Network Administration, and Internet Architecture. Graduated with a 96% average and MS Certificate of excellence. The rest is primarily work related, and additional certifications, which lead me to Network Security, Network + and Security + certs, including firewall and AV administration.\n\nThis all resulted in a job as Network Security Administration and Anti Viral Administration for numerous high profile organizations and companies.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's insane, you started from being a newbie and now you're an expert in the field. It's amazing to think how far you can go once you find something you love. Do you have any advice for people trying to learn?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Stick to it.\nDon't walk in thinking your going to become a pro at ANY field of IT without the sweat to go along with it. You WILL fail, more than you want to.\nFailure should always be a lesson learned in what not to repeat.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Great advice, that even applies to people outside of the IT field. Moving on, what brought you to HF in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] I ran an IRC based chat service which was getting Denial of Serviced by a disgruntled EX member, we re-enforced our infrastructure, but I needed IRC tools to stress test the services. I never did get a reliable link or referral from that, but I lingered regardless. If you actually notice in my profile, although I joined in 2011, my activity was very minimal, I mainly just read the threads.  It was not until recently I decided to actually take an active part in the community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] A lot of people tend to be lurkers for quite some time before becoming active. What made you stay until now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] I saw a lot in the community, There were answers I found here, where no matter where else I looked it was more straight forward or ONLY answered on HF without the \"censorship\"\n\nNumerous times I used HF as a base to determine if what my work related incidents were related to say an active threat in the wild (Code Red was one of the major ones). Plus the general atmosphere, there is every different person from every walk of life in the community, it brings a wide diversity to the community\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed, you have access to a breadth of knowledge and lots of helpful members no matter what you're searching for. What's one thing you'd do to improve the site if you were given the opportunity?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Modify the \"New thread\" structure to pre search existing threads for similar ones already in existence. I believe this would reduce spam, even just slightly. Other than that, I love the site as is.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] True, I see tons of threads about the same topic all the time. Maybe one day Omni will implement it. Moving on, what do you usually do outside of HF and Networking?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Spend time with my family, One of my favorite things to do is go Camping, although hard to believe there is nothing more than I enjoy but to simply leave all the tech behind, and go \"Rough it\" in the wild for some time.  I am really hopeful to still get out this year before it cools down, otherwise it might be Canadian winter camping! I am also a real movie fanatic, I am building my physical disk collection largely, but my digital collection is close to 750 TB at this point. \n\nTerminator Genesis sucks BTW, watched it last night, terrible...\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Definitely a fun way to pass the time haha. That's a pretty impressive stash, maybe one day you can look back on it and remember all the things you enjoyed. Anyway that's all the time we have, is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap things up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=white][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the time and interview, look forward to seeing everyone in the forums!\n[/align] [/spoiler] [/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

The purpose of which was to have a single distro to perform well in any given network or web application security test. When Backtrack was discontinued and the team developed the new-and-improvied Kali distribution, security professionals quickly moved over. Now, the newest release in the line of security is Kali Sana, which can be [url=https://www.kali.org/downloads/]downloaded here[/url] for a wide range of devices and architectures. The newest distro features a more flashy Gnome3 shell User Interface as well as Debian 8 Jessie-based packages, and is now a rolling release distribution. Minor changes include native Ruby 2.0 support, making programs such as Metasploit Framework run significantly faster. The highly anticipated release certainly lived up to, and in many ways surpassed, its expectations.\n\n[color=white][b]NSA Playset[/b][/color]\nAt Defcon 22 in 2014, I attended a talk entitled The NSA Playset: RF Retroreflectors by Michael Ossmann wherein a number of radio frequency retro-reflectors were presented. This allows the detection of various types of signals such as VGA, USB, and PS/2, with a small device. The company/developers started out attempting to replicate devices found in the [url=https://www.aclu.org/files/natsec/nsa/20140130/NSA%27s%20Spy%20Catalogue.pdfhttps://www.aclu.org/files/natsec/nsa/20140130/NSA%27s%20Spy%20Catalogue.pdf]leaked NSA ANT Catalogue[/url], and have been continually adding to their arsenal ever since. Now, the acclaimed security professionals have added over a dozen products, each with comedically random names mimicking those found in the actual document, full of information on how to create various devices such as the RF Retroreflector, GSM frequency interception, auto-piloted reconnaissance drone using a WiFi Pineapple, keystroke interceptors, and various other devices. The NSA Playset can be found [url=http://www.nsaplayset.org/]at this link[/url].\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://ihydra.net/hfnt/headers/SecurityNews.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Lenovo Put a Rootkit In Their Bios[/color][/b]\nLenovo the chinese computer manufacture of the most beloved Thinkbooks is once again in hot water this week. A security issue discovered back in May blew up this week when users found out about it in detail. The \"software engine\" as Lenovo describes it could be used to install malicious software on your computer, with no explanation from them on why they built it into the bios in the first place. Users first became aware of the issue when doing clean installs of vanilla Windows and Lenovo's software would auto install itself. After digging they came across a mysterious process called autochk.exe that was executing during startup. While they did issue a bulletin and fix back in June users where not notified and over 16 millions devices could be effected. After the trouble with superfish malware coming preinstalled only a few months ago the DoD has now decided to phase out all Lenovo products by 2018.

One of the most interesting points was that Kali 2.0 was released as a much improved update to the OS. A beautiful new interface has been added along with dozens of new a powerful tools that will be useful to the system admin and pen tester alike. Along with multiple new versions for different platforms such as Raspberry Pi and new VM images released. The makers feel that this has been a cumulative effort many years in the making, with this being their best platform yet.

The exploit gave attackers the ability to upload/download files and potentially gain full control of the system. Further research shows that attackers from EU where using this back to at least July 27th. Just a few months ago multiple exploit bugs where rewarded for firefox however none were severe as this. If you have not already patched to the latest version is it highly recommended that you do so.

In an official statement made to Gamesbeat, Sony stated the following: ““We are truly humbled by the success of the PS4, and we would like to thank gamers for making it the top-selling console and No. 1 in software sales in the United States in July.” Sony has stated that their [i]Batman: Arkham Knight[/i] console bundle greatly helped with sales and are projecting even more sales in the coming months with the release of a [i]Destiny[/i] Playstation 4 bundle based on the game’s new DLC [i]The Taken King[/i], which is scheduled to be released September 15.

The community has now decided to play a considerably more difficult game in the form of [i]Dark Souls[/i]. Although the game is traditionally more difficult, veterans of the [i]Dark Souls[/i] series have stated that the game may be easier to complete through a bruteforce of commands than [i]Pokemon[/i], since [i]Dark Souls[/i] doesn’t make levelling up a necessity for game completion and actively prevents players from getting stuck at different points within the game.

The developers made a post going over some of the things that will be available to modders, which reads as follows: \"Thanks to texture import and export, gamers can now modify the looks and feel of in-game objects, while the possibility of substituting meshes allows to insert new models in the game world in place of existing ones,\" the post reads. \"Finally, access to script files opens up an entirely new array or modification options to many in-game aspects, so modders can fire up their imagination and fiddle with item statistics and much more.\" The ModKit is available to download at Nexus Mods with documentation regarding it being located on the site’s forums.

Mac users currently running 32-bit versions of Windows within Boot Camp will need to back up their data and wipe the operating system before reinstalling the 64-bit version of Windows 10. New installs of Windows using the Boot Camp Assistant tool should download the new drivers automatically, and those performing upgrade installs can use the Windows version of Apple's Software Update tool to download the new drivers before performing the Windows 10 upgrade install.\n\nFor owners of Macs that can't run Yosemite or Boot Camp 6 there's still a way to run Windows 10. They can, for example, run virtualization software such as VirtualBox or Parallels Desktop 10.

If you're currently playing your Xbox One games on your Windows 10 PC or laptop, you might be interested to learn that there is a way to dramatically boost streaming quality. Reddit user OomaThurman has publicized the method for unlocking this hidden quality setting, which involves editing the \"userconsoledata\" file in your Xbox app folder. You can activate the new higher-quality setting by setting the \"IsInternalPreview\" flag from \"false\" to \"true,\" a naming convention that strongly suggests this feature is part of an early test that will be formally rolled out to all Windows 10 users in the future.

At the Flash Memory Summit in California, Samsung unveiled what appears to be the world's largest hard drive, packed into a conveniently sized 2.5-inch case — and somewhat surprisingly, it uses the company's new 256Gbit (32GB) NAND flash die rather than spinning platters. This is a pretty significant announcement. Flash memory is generally faster than its disc-spinning counterpart, although it generally doesn't offer the highest amounts of storage. This drive, however, offers much more than the largest conventional drives made by Western Digital or Seagate, which max out at around 10 TB.
