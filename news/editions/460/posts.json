Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,” Google tweeted.

Since the creation of the new rover, it has been referred to as “Mars 2020.” Students around the US sent in essays to NASA, through a contest they conducted, proposing what the rover's new name should be. Over 28,000 entries were received, and the results were reduced to 155 entries by the judges. The last nine names included: Endurance, Tenacity, Promise, Perseverance, Vision, Clarity, Ingenuity, Fortitude, and Courage. Perseverance was selected from a middle school student in Virginia who wrote, “We, not as a nation, but as humans, will not give up. We will always persevere into the future.” Perseverance will be joining curiosity on Mars and begin helping with exploration.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nasas-mars-2020-rover-gets-an-official-name-perseverance/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]TED Given Two Options [/color][/b]\r\nWith events such as Google I / O, Facebook F8, and SXSW canceled due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, TED is heading in the same direction. People who attended the event were allowed to vote for a virtual conference or to postpone the event until July. Chris Anderson, the curator, said, “We are not canceling. We have two compelling options for how to outwit this virus.” If the event were to take place in July, it could still face potential problems and eventually come to a virtual conference. But with a virtual meeting, it comes with its own set of issues that may arise. Some of the biggest names in technology are present at TED, and not being able to connect in person over the few days of the conference might be a significant drawback for people attending.

But it’s been postponed, unlikely to happen this year at all.\"   [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.vg247.com/2020/03/06/delay-ps5-xbox-series-x-launch-coronavirus/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Silent Hill soft reboot, Silent Hills revival in the works[/color][/b]\r\nSome good news in the wake of all the recent unfortunate news is that Silent Hill is currently in soft reboot with Sony’s Japan Studio co-developing it. Sony is said to be the one responsible for pitching the project, but it’s not clear if another team at Konami is developing it alongside SIE Japan. Some of the studios recently published work showcased that of the P.T. Demo (that was later cancelled). Rely on Horror says Sony is also behind this project, and it’s working to “patch up the relationship between Kojima Productions and Konami.”  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.vg247.com/2020/03/13/silent-hill-soft-reboot/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]A new Test Drive Unlimited game is in development[/color][/b]\r\nIt's been a long time since the first Test Drive Unlimited set the tone for open-world racers, and almost ten since its desperate post-burnout paradise sequel. So it's about time that the franchise has returned to the limelight, and now there has been confirmed that it will be: KT Racing - Kylotonn, the studio behind the World Rally Championship arrangement, is currently in production. \"They're based in Paris and Lyon. They're specialized in racing. They're doing off-road racing with WRC, and they're doing two-wheel racing with Isle of Man TT.\"  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.pcgamer.com/a-new-test-drive-unlimited-game-is-in-development/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]AMD is changing the type of cooler it uses on next-gen graphics cards[/color][/b]\r\nIn case you're not an aficionado of blower-style GPU coolers, AMD has uplifting news—it's disposing of them for its cutting edge Radeon graphics cards dependent on its RDNA 2 engineering. In its place, AMD will change to a hub fan cooling arrangement, similarly as Nvidia did when it propelled its GeForce RTX arrangement, and later its GeForce GTX cards dependent on Turing. \"There will be no blower reference fans for gamers on next-gen. So you are correct,\" Herkelman wrote, with a winky-face for good measure.\"   [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-is-changing-the-type-of-cooler-it-uses-on-next-gen-graphics-cards/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Rust gets more security conscious with the CCTV update[/color][/b]\r\nCCTV cameras can be set up inside or around your base, after which you can see their feeds on your PC. You'll additionally need to appoint every camera a one of a kind identifier from the PC, letting you or any other person with the name get to the feed. Most likely best to stay quiet about it, at that point. Players have their hands on some encoded identifiers that will ideally prompt something intriguing, in the event that they can be split. You can begin hacking endlessly on your new PCs now. What more could you possibly want from the developers of Rust?

The virus has been the cause of many different cancelations and delays and it looks like we will have to put up with it for the time being. Re:Zero's second season was scheduled to air during the spring. At the current time, there is no date set on when the second season will start. For now, the official website, as well as Re:Zero's Twitter to stay tuned for any announcements. [i][size=x-small][url=https://otakumode.com/news/5e6613036122f593021c26e6/Re-Zero-Season-2-Postpones-Air-Date-to-July]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Anime Trope For Glasses Made Real[/color][/b]\r\nA Japanese design firm by the name of EkōD Works has recently created a pair of glasses that will appeal to anime and manga lovers. In anime, there is a trope that is occasionally used. When viewing a character's profile (side view) there is a likely chance that part of the temple is removed, therefore revealing more of the character's eyes. That is not always the case, so some people might not understand what this means. To get a better understanding, please click this link [url=https://i.imgur.com/RJY2Vjm.png]here[/img]. In the picture provided in that link, you can see a female character with a portion of her glasses removed. This is to provide a clear look at that character's eyes as mentioned earlier. At the moment, only a prototype has been created and a [/url][url=https://twitter.com/ekoDWorks/status/1237337012367028225]Twitter[/url] thread was created showcasing the glasses.

That streaming service is more than likely Crunchyroll. Not everyone has a premium subscription for the service, though. Users are allowed to create free accounts if they do not wish to upgrade to a premium subscription. There are a few downsides to not having a premium membership. There are multiple reasons as to why someone would upgrade their account. One beneficial one is the removal of ads. Second, a guaranteed high-quality server for you to watch whatever anime you are watching. This will reduce buffer time and ensure that you have the greatest watching quality. One last example is that premium members can watch series a few days earlier than free members. Sounds great, right?\r\n\r\nPlease note this is no way an advertisement to purchase a membership.\r\n\r\nThere are good things about being a free member too! It was recently discovered that non-premium members can view certain anime in 720p and 1080p. It is as simple as clicking the \"cog wheel\" via the media player and changing your source. As simple and easy as that little trick is, not too many people have realized you can do this. On YouTube it's general an instinct to want a higher quality video. When your video on YouTube is buffering or looks low quality, you usually see if you can bump it to 720p or 1080p, right? This certainly makes sense. But why would this not be the first thought when it comes to Crunchyroll? Crunchyroll's premium service page lists that free members can only watch videos in 480p. Additionally, you would think that a service that requires you to upgrade will have some sort of quality benefit, where as YouTube is just a free video platforming website. Key term \"free.\"\r\n\r\nThis is very misleading and more than likely is a way to trick you into purchasing a membership. Writers of the anime news website, AnimeNewsNetwork, reached out to the support service of Crunchyroll to get an answer on why they market the page that way, but they refused to give any comments. [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2020-03-10/you-can-watch-crunchyroll-streams-in-1080p-for-free-its-just-not-advertised/.157362]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Pokémon the Movie: Coco Releases Latest Trailer![/color][/b]\r\nIn Japan on July 10, the twenty-third Pokémon movie, \"Pokémon the Movie: Coco,\" will be released in theatres. Similar to the American film, \"George of the Jungle,\" Coco will take place in a forest, where a young boy named Coco lives among Pokémon. You can compare both movies in many different ways. Both involve children who were raised in the jungle (forest for Coco) by the creatures that inhabit it and growing up in that environment and even thinking they are the species they grew up with. In the trailer, you can see Coco flying across trees using vines and eating berries. The mythical Pokémon Zarude raised Coco. This Pokémon is new to everyone and has never been seen before. They both live in Okoya Forest, which is off-limits to those without specific credentials as it is a safe-haven for Pokémon to live in. Long behold, we have one of everyone's favorite main character, Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in the Japanese version), being the adventurer he always is and decides to explore the forest. Soon after, Ash finds himself meeting Coco. Feel free to watch the trailer [url=https://youtu.be/AJ_7ZcklO9k]here[/url].

Funimation is pleased to announce that Fruits Basket 2nd Season will be airing the first three episodes of the season in theatres across America. You can find a location near you by clicking the link [url=https://www.funimationfilms.com/movie/fruits-basket/]here[/url]! The showings will suffice for those who enjoy watching dubbed or subbed versions of anime. The viewing for the English dub will take place on March 30, whereas the subtitled version will take place a day after on March 31. For those who want to sit back and relax at home to watch it, the anime will be airing on April 6. If you felt the first season had a cliffhanger ended, do not fear as the second season will cover the of the manga.

The Azur Lane mobile fanbase is quite vast, and this delay has lowered the ratings slightly as a result. Having to wait three months for the last two episodes of a series for a minimal reason is quite silly, but it might just be more serious going on behind the scenes. At the beginning of January, individual TV stations in Japan have rebroadcasted the anime from the beginning so that viewers can refresh their memory on what happened. Viewers should expect the eleventh episode to air on March 13 and the twelfth to air on March 20.
