The new forum is called [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=259][b]Personal Life[/b][/url] and can be found by clicking [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=259][b]Personal Life[/b][/url]. You cannot post in [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=259][b]Personal Life[/b][/url] itself, but there are a series of sub sections off the forum. These sub forums consist of [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=260]Education Nation[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=261]Pet Peeve[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=262]Health Wise[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=180]Innuendo[/url], which was moved there. It was quite a surprise when [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] added all of these sections at once, but there's no denying that it was a great choice. A general section should consist of these sections.\n\n[color=white][b]Header Search Bar Removed[/b][/color]\nSite Owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] announced in last week's addition that a search bar was added to the Hack Forums header. This has now been removed due to complains about its appearance. I didn't see a problem with it, but I guess others did. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] wasn't very happy; it was suggested, agreed with, and then people complained. We can live without it though.\n\n[color=white][b]Fierce Change to the Sticky Policy [/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made an incredibly direct approach on the sticky policy alteration. There will be no more than one sticky per person at any given time. Anyone getting partners or friends posting threads for them will be banned. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated, \"I've warned lots of people about this but a few appear to think they are above the rules. That shiny red award won't mean shit to you when your account is closed\". Just a heads up for those Master Donators who think they're above the rules. This new change in policy is to make it fair for other products. Multiple people have had up to nine stickies at one given time, between two partners. I won't mention who he is, but he knows he goes by \"the king of all noobs\".\n\n[color=white][b]Beacon Sold and Changing to Guardians[/b][/color]\nThe Minecraft based group, previously named Beacon, owned by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][b]Dan.[/b][/url] has been purchased by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/url]. Leader [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][b]Morchid[/b][/url] announced that the new group will be named Guardians. No official information about the group has been released yet. We're not currently sure what the direct point or objective for this group is, but they will be announcing it after the userbar has been made and selected. You can read more about it at the official thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3323452]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]User [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=63387]Black Shadow[/url] Exposing Members Again[/b][/color]\nWell known member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=63387][color=#0066FF][b]Black Shadow[/b][/color][/url] has been on the exposing wagon once again, and as far as I'm concerned, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=63387][color=#0066FF][b]Black Shadow[/b][/color][/url] is never not exposing people. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=63387][color=#0066FF][b]Black Shadow[/b][/color][/url] set a trap to expose now dead accounted user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=844889][color=#383838][b]Monster.PPD[/b][/color][/url].

Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] Hey CM, I'm cool on the shoutout front thanks!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome! So, a general trend with my interviews is that I like to ask one starting question: What was it that brought you to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] I lurked for years, until I found out that some weird guy in my IT and Tech class at Highschool I knew was kind of \"big\" on it, or so he said. I decided that I may as well have a go at joining the community, and here I am! I have always been fascinated with computers and how they work (as well what makes them not work). Just as with an awful lot of people, making an income also got me hooked onto HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] And who is that \"weird guy\"? 🤣 \nWhat's your greatest interest that pertains to the forums? I mean, hacking, coding, marketing etc. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] I can't remember the name of him sadly, although I think his name was something along the lines of \"PotatoYoghurt\" or \"AubergineSoup\" ;)\n\nMarketing is a huge thing for me, I'm constantly coming up with business ideas that I try to implement, however I haven't yet hit my jackpot (or a small, stable income which is what I am aiming for first). I have been writing a (free) ebook actually, to give back to the community a little bit, although that's on my half-way-finished list. I love the Cryptography and Botnets section also, I love networks and also computer-security and those two lend themselves perfectly to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I think that's a pretty good hint ;)\nThat seems to be huge in the HF community. It never fails to surprise me how a community based around a specific topic (i.e. hacking) can be so diverse in its interests and discussions! It's awesome to see that HF isn't just about hacking - there's much more to it.\nWhat's sort of the goal here, then? I mean, in the big picture; what do you hope to achieve? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] I'm aiming to be self employed, I would like to be owning a few online businesses in areas that I am interested in that enable me to work from anywhere in the world - The internet connects billions of people from all around the world, and collectively all these people know the entire extent of human knowledge. I would love to have a business that offers free education to those who are interested, or perhaps offers gateways to other free education. Besides online work, I have been looking at investing in robotics an automated systems to hire out to people for both domestic and commercial use; I would love to be a forerunner in bringing the newest technology to common usage by the public, whilst making a tidy profit as well! It's my belief that by moving more and more manual jobs from humans to robotics and computers will eventually increase the quality of life across the whole world.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Thing is, most people (in our sort of \"range\") will stick to the same old routine. Go to school, go to university, get a degree, get a comfortable job and live their boring 9-5 lives. It's people that [i]want[/i] to do something different and not be limited that innovate. Do you think there's something that sparked that whole \"I'm going to do my own thing, screw you\" sort of attitude? Or do you just hate the thought of the monotony a \"simpleton\" life would bring?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I was a bizarre little child. At a young age I wanted to conquer the world and be lauded as the \"Master of Earth\". Eventually as my plans to conquer the world by age 14 fell through, I started settling for smaller goals (conquer a continent, conquer a country, then eventually just become immensely rich and powerful without any conquering). I think the big thing that set this all off for me is that I didn't want to be forgotten when I died (conquering the world would pretty much do that for me). I've come to really dislike the consensus that to lead a good life you need to go to University, work at an above-average job, buy a house (which you don't actually own because you have a mortgage), raise a family and then retire and live out your final years in peace - What's the point in that? I want to enjoy myself now and have my freedom for as long as I can.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] You still owe be $10 for that, btw ;)\nMhmm, I don't understand that thought; I'll work hard in my youth so I can have some enjoyment for the last few years of my life and my health deteriorates. Like, dafuq is that all about?\nI mean, I understand people have different circumstances, but that brings me on to the next thing: people say you should be grateful for the opportunities you get and that some people just get \"lucky\". I think that's such BS; you make your own look and create your own opportunities. If you're not where you want to be, it's not anyone else's but yours. \nI'm super proud of myself when I think back on all the amazing things I've done and not being one of those people that are like \"yeah, wow, how awesome would it be to do this\" but instead, actually going out and doing it! \n\nThat brings me on to my next question; what are a few things you definitely want to accomplish in the coming years? (Short term goals).\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] Shh, you were supposed to have forgotten about that ;)\n\nExactly, sometimes people are lucky, but determination and will gets you much further. One of my favourite quotes is \"Opportunities multiply as they are seized\" (Sun Tzu) - The more you put yourself up to doing, the more that will become available to you. So many people have the sad belief that they will just become rich one day, that it's inevitable that they become rich even without trying.\n\nI have a 3 major goals I want to accomplish in the next 5 years;\nI want to have a reasonable income from online business ventures\nI want to move to either India or Mexico and live there for a minimum of 3 years\nand I want to learn, to an advanced level, the native language(s) of wherever I decide to move.\n\nOf course, I have several other goals, but those are the ones I believe will have the greatest effect on my life. I would love to be able to travel indefinitely and have a life-long adventure. I have been toying with the idea of cycling about 2600 miles through Europe in 40 days this summer (just to see if I could do it) which would entail me cycling for about 5 hours a day, although I would need a lot more training to get myself up to that level.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Mexico is beautiful; I mean, we heard [i]all[/i] about it from our friend, Asger! ;D Not to mention already experiencing India firsthand for ourselves! \nYou say you really want to learn a native language, and this is a little \"debate\" I've been toying with in my mind for a while. As we advance (the human civilisation and technology), English is definitely becoming huge. \nThese forward movements are certainly exciting, but they're also unsettling to me. Each and everyday, I see older cultures and heritages being destroyed. By destroyed, I mean everything becoming modernised. Sure, that's a great thing, but does that negate the need to learn foreign languages? Or because of the dominance English holds, is that all that anyone ever needs to know?\nIt sort of annoys me to an extent where things I've loved about my culture are slowly, well...dying out. But then again, it's amazing to think how far the human civilisation has come in the past couple of centuries.\nI could go on forever about this sort of stuff, but what do you think?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] I love the diversity the world presents, both in people and in places. I want to be able to talk to millions of people without need of a translator, whilst English is becoming massive, there are still billions of people who don't speak English well, if it at all.\n\nCultures are changing constantly all the time. Whilst I too hate to see the export of western culture and I would love to see other countries modernising of their own accord, in their own ways, many cultures have retained their sense of identity whilst being extremely technologically advanced, for example, Japan. When I think of my culture, there really isn't much of what was around a few hundred years ago - Very few people dye themselves blue with woad when going to battle, very few people pay homage to whatever pagan festivals there were, no one wear's a tophat and tails to work, instead of going to ballroom dances or practicing archery people play on their XBOX or Playstation. We've replaced one culture with another, but it's still ours. I would just like cultures retaining their character rather than adopting western values and beliefs without analysing them to see whether these values are beneficial or not.\n\nThe fantastic thing about technology is that the further we get, the faster we advance. Imagine if we make an artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than us - Then that can create an artificial intelligence more intelligent than itself, and so on so forth.\n\nIf we advance even half as quickly as we did in the past century, we're going to have one hell of a future! We have driverless cars just about ready to come out into the public, we have spacetourism, we have organisations racing to put the first man on Mars, and we have access to the knowledge of humanity in our pockets with smartphones, we are edging closer to finding cures for the most dangerous human virus (HIV) and we are living in the most peaceful era of humanity there ever has been. WE LIVE IN THE FUTURE GUYS!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] But what I'm trying to say is that all of this comes with a price. And I'm one who's all for the future; heck, technology is my primary source of income. \nThe further we get, the further away the memories of the past get. And sure, it is just \"the past\" but what I'm sort of getting at is that life is an experience. And regardless of how far we get technologically, nothing will change that [i]human experience[/i]. Someone who lived a century ago could have the same satisfaction with their life as someone who will live a century from now. There's no escaping the fact that life is life and everything within it (emotions, enjoyment, happiness) is all subjective and there's nothing definitive. \n\nI'm someone who's definitely a strong believer in mind over matter - if someone gives up at something it's their own fucking fault. If I put my head to something, you can sure as hell bet that I'll do it. But when you feel an emotion, something so strong that it overwhelms you, there's no explanation for it. It's something you can't control...and although that's sort of veering off from our discussion, it's something that I find incredibly fascinating and shows off the fact that regardless of how much we advance technologically, we're still human.\n\nBecause this is an interview and not a written piece, please understand that a lot of my discussion is a little disjointed.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] Oh yes, certainly, I agree. Although I believe that technology does open up many more opportunities for us, we are more able to control our own destinies than people in the past may have done, I would like to think.\n\nI also believe in mind over matter, an awful lot of people are successful because of their self-discipline and determination, and I hold myself to that. I think that human psychology is fascinating, the way emotions work, how the brain works. Emotions are extremely illogical, but being illogical is what has lent humanity to such advancement. A lot of people will stop projects that they are working on because they get bored, when being bored is just an emotional state and has very little real physical effect on you.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Okay, I'm going to cut it off here before we take it any further. Hey, maybe you could join us again and we could continue our discussion :).\nThanks a ton for a great interview, any last words to conclude?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=571039][color=white][b]131:[/b][/color][/url] I would just like to thank the HF community for being very helpful and friendly.

Have you got any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Which white guy? Humor asides; I do. I'd like to give a shout out to the members in The Alliance, Void, and The Empire. To single some out: CarrotMilk, Mohatu; who is teaching me the arts of l33t hecks, Hexicidal for being a very chill guy who won't treat you like half of the group owners here, and Positive.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] With all that said, let's get started! What brought you on HF in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Like many other users I wanted to learn more about hacking; I also had an interest in programming. HF is the only forum I've remained \"dedicated\" to, just because of the sheer content and diversity it provides. Every single section HF has is active, which is why I like it so much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I honestly have to say that HF is indeed a great community. What have you learned since you joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I've learned many things. Nothing really revolving around hacking sadly, I mainly program/code things. I currently know: VB.NET, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, and I'm learning C++, CSS, more HTML, Ruby, and quite a few other things. I love to program/code. :D\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any personal suggestions that could make HF a better forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, yes I do. I made a feedback thread not too long ago as a matter of fact. I'll give you a tl;dr version real quick: MOTM is a complete and utter popularity contest. It has nothing to do with who is the best member. In a forum that I'm an avid user of, the mod does nothing. Moderators don't even get reports out of their section, and considering he doesn't even visit/frequent the section, why is he a moderator of it? I know quite a few people that would be more than qualified for the job. I also thing there should be a couple more Staff members. People that are qualified for that are kinda hard to find though, considering how big and notorious HF is. Anyways, next? :P\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I see you're in a couple official HF groups. Are you enjoying the experience so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I am, yes. I'm quite proud to be a member of The Alliance; so many people apply, and only a select few get in. TA also only holds around 1-2 recruitments a year. TA was actually the first group I was ever interested in joining. When the \"Introductions\" section was still on HF, the first member to welcome me was in The Alliance. :P The members in Void are all extremely inteligent also, the debates held within the subforum are extremely mature. The Empire is just a bunch of noobs, tbh.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I'm also very interested in The Alliance. I'll make sure to apply next time they open recruitment. Moving on, you're very active in the VB & .NET section which is great. Do you have any other interests?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I do, of course. I mainly frequent that section only because it's the most active. Plus, TA has the PHP, C++, and some other sections already covered. I am interested in any kind of programming/coding.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I've seen a couple big projects from you in the past. Could you describe some of them and maybe give us a sneek peek of something that you'll be releasing in the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I created a \"Public HWID Base\", that incorporates an online ACP. A lot of people in the VB.NET section have interests in autheticating users, and keeping track of other things of that nature. I support open source, so almost everything I create I release the source aswell as the binary file. I've actually got something that will be coming out fairly soon. It's not going to be free or open source, like most of my projects are. Should see it out within 1-2 week(s). :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Great answers. Enough about your time on HF! Do you have any IRL hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I do. I play paintball sometimes, and I also go \"mudding\". Yes, I'm from the South.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#00BFFF][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for your time and your in-depth answers, SWG! Any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768][color=white][b]SomeWhiteGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I'd just like to say thanks for interviewing me, and I hope everyone reading this has an excellent day. 🤝\n[/spoiler]",

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113]Dan.[/url] made an announcement earlier in the week stating that the PlanetBeacon factions world will be used for both playerbases, however new Skyblock and creative worlds have been implemented. Because of the server merge, PlanetBeacon has welcomed an influx of new players over the past week; activity peaks at almost 200 players per day! Along with all this, enthusiastic donators can now enjoy some new features. In addition to the Legend and Hero ranks, VIP, Star, Master, and Elite can now be obtained by donating, starting at $10 and going all the way up to $75! The higher priced ranks allow donators to enjoy new commands such as /fireball, /ender, /smite, and much more. Along with this, donators of $75 have access to unlimited homes and the ability to create mob spawners. All ranks now enjoy new /kits, which grant diamond armor and a diamond sword. Generous donors have the privilege of additional PvP goodies in their /kit, which can be obtained once per day. To view a detailed description of the new ranks, click [url=http://store.planetbeacon.com/category/11276]here.[/url] \n\n[b][color=white]1.5 is now official![/color][/b]\nMinecraft 1.5, the Redstone update, is now official! This update brought some exciting new redstone gadgets and mechanics and boasts one of the most complicated changelogs yet. I explained some of the new features last week so I'd like to give a brief summary of the new mechanics; first of all, hostile mob damage has been increased from half a heart to a whole heart. A new nether quartz ore block, which drops nether quartz when mined, now spawns in the nether. A new redstone mechanic was implemented which affects how far redstone signal goes; the stronger the pulse, the longer the pulse goes. This applies to new gadgets such as weighted pressure plates and daylight sensors. For some lucky members, Minecraft Realms was also implemented in this update. This new feature allows players to create servers hosted by Mojang and invite other players with the feature to join. \n\n[b][color=#87CEEB]PlanetBeacon[/color] [color=white]News: [/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=397679]Anarchy[/url] went on a raiding spree and managed to hit a few small or factionless bases as well as Reapers.\n[*]Chad held a siege on Wolves at their base and the two factions enjoyed a long (and enjoyable) session of cat and mouse PVP.

A prison server, for those unfamiliar, is a server where players work from the bottom up to being released. To rank up, players must do tasks such as mining, creating a shop, smelting, PVPing, and more to earn money and buy their way to freedom.

Major Nelson confirmed this on twitter saying, \"Confirmed: All sign-up pages for testing the 'next Xbox' are fake. Do not give them your information--it's a scam.\" It's important that you don't enter your information on any suspicious website because there is a good chance they are phishing for your account details. Microsoft may announce the new Xbox console sometime in April according to latest rumors.\n\n[color=white][b]Halo 4 Castle Map Pack Dated[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft have announced the date for the upcoming Halo 4 Castle Map Pack. The new map pack will bring three new multiplayer maps, along with a new Castle DLC playlist supporting 6v6 teamplay, including objective game types. If you love achievements, you'll be happy to hear that the new pack will launch nine new achievements worth 250 Gamerscores. The new pack will launch on April 8th with [b]Daybreak[/b], [b]Outcast[/b] and [b]Perdition[/b]. It will be available for 800 Microsoft Points or for FREE if you have the War Games Map Pass. DLC achievements have not been yet detailed.\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Daybreak[/b] - Two UNSC bases oppose each other in this large asymmetrical map. Teams must split focus between attacking the enemy base while playing close defense to their own. Claim your team’s sniper rifle to cover the central Man Cannon, or grab a Warthog to push through the side channels and flank the enemy base. The Rocket Launcher and Banshee both spawn in positions diagonal to the starting bases; claiming their firepower early is crucial to land the first flag cap or take an early lead in kills.\n[*][b]Outcast[/b] - Controlling vehicle paths is critical in this circular map set in a desert environment. Outcast features frequent Mantis vs. Wraith battles, so teams must keep their drivers informed with constant communication to get the drop on enemy vehicles. While driving the Mantis, you can target fusion coils in tunnels to flush out camping opponents directly into your rain of fire, or cover your flag runner’s dash to a friendly Warthog. If you find yourself without a vehicle, race to the secondary bases to secure a power weapon or drop on enemies for a game-changing hijack.\n[*][b]Perdition[/b] - Blending long sightlines, vehicles, and close-quarters combat, Perdition caters to nearly any gameplay style. Wheelmen and gunners will be right at home in this urban environment as a well-placed Warthog can lock down a quarter of the map, securing valuable ordnances for the team. Learning the interior routes is essential to both escaping danger and finishing off ranged kills. Be sure to look for the Gravity Hammer in Power Station 3 – an ideal revenge weapon against a pesky sniper or a big surprise for an enemy Warthog.\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Black Ops II Microtransactions Now Available on Xbox[/b][/color]\nActivision have launched Microtransactions on the Xbox version of Black Ops II. The micro items offer in-game \"personal customizations or nice little luxuries.\" These micro items do not affect gameplay, however they enhance user experience. Transactions can range from 80 MSP to 400 MSP, however most are 160 MSP. \n\n* Thanks to [url=http://oneofswords.com/2013/03/nuketown-2025-now-free-for-everybody/]One of Swords[/url] for the pack descriptions. \n[list]\n[*][b]Personalization Packs[/b] - Like dress-up for your favorite weapons. Each themed pack contains a unique weapon camo, three targeting reticles (one each for the Reflex, EO Tech, and ACOG sights), and a custom player Calling Card. All that stuff comes as a set for 160 MS Points.\n[*][b]Nuketown 2025[/b] - Folks have been asking me about the pre-order bonus map’s wide availability for some time now, so here it is – and it’s free, so all players can enjoy it together.\n[*][b]Nuketown Zombies[/b] - If you didn’t get Nuketown Zombies as part of the Hardened or Care Package limited editions of the game, now you can get it as a standalone level for 400 MS Points.\n[*][b]Extra Slots Pack[/b] - This one is for the players who requested even more loadouts and/or are fans of Theater Mode. You can now get 10 more Create-a-Class slots (giving you 20 total if you’ve gone all the way up to Prestige Master) and significantly expand your media storage, allowing you to archive 20 more emblems, 32 more films and 40 more screenshots for 160 MS Points.\n[*][b]Flags of the World Calling Card Packs[/b] - These packs include national flag-themed Calling Cards from countries around the world. Packs are divided by geographical region and costs 80 MS Points per region pack.\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Games (Mar-Apr)[/b][/color]\n[b]Mar 19, 2013[/b] - Gears of War: Judgment\n[b]Mar 19, 2013[/b] - The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct\n[b]Mar 26, 2013[/b] - Army of TWO: The Devil's Cartel\n[b]Mar 26, 2013[/b] - BioShock Infinite\n[b]Mar 26, 2013[/b]- Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14\n[b]Apr 02, 2013[/b] - Defiance\n[b]Apr 02, 2013[/b] - Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge\n[b]Apr 16, 2013[/b] - Injustice: Gods Among Us\n[b]Apr 16, 2013[/b] - Painkiller: Hell & Damnation\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThis week we have a video from the channel YouAlwaysWin, by Meatwagon and GUNNS4HIRE.

While he was a high official in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, a junta in the area had abducted and kidnapped  priests Francisco Jalics and Orlando Yorio for months. The times stated that \"they surfaced five months later, drugged and seminude, in a field,\" In 2005, the new people was implicated in a lawsuit to have been involved with the kidnappings. Rumors have spread that Pope Francis essentially gave them to the military group. As reported by the Associated Press, \"Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the regime that he endorsed their work. Jalics refused to discuss it after moving into seclusion in a German monastery.\" The Pope's biographer, Sergio Rubin, told AP that he went to to great lengths to appeal for the priests release. You can view the Pope Francis' speech here: http://goo.gl/3PKwP\n\n[b][color=white]Nine or More Dead From Car Bomb[/color][/b]\nThis Sunday in the Shi'ite south of Iraq, a car bombing left nine or more people people dead. Specifically, the bomb was let loose in Garmat Ali. There hasn't yet been any groups taking responsibility for the acts. Hameed Salman, a bus driver and witness to the havoc, stated, \"I carried five bodies myself and put them in some civilian cars to take them to the hospital.\" While most sources have reported nine being dead, The head of the provincial security committee said that it was actually ten. The shared government is facing increased violence since US troops left over a year ago.\n\n[b][color=white]North Korea Attacked[/color][/b]\nNorth Korea has stated they have recently been subjected to an alarming rate of cyber attacks. The state claims that \"hostile forces\" such as the United States and South Korea are clearly the ones behind such attacks. KCNA reported, \"It is nobody's secret that the U.S. and the South Korean puppet regime are massively bolstering up cyberforces in a bid to intensify the subversive activities and sabotages against the DPRK... They are seriously mistaken if they think they can quell the DPRK's voices of justice through such base acts. The U.S. and its allies should be held wholly accountable for the ensuing consequences.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2jdYa[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nApple has been in a bind relating to the In App Purchase (iAP) system that many applications use from the App Store. Kids across the world have been buying free applications, but then downloading an iAP purchase without their parents approval. A five year old British child has purchased over $2,500 worth of In App Purchases in just one week. When his mother had found out about it, she had opened a lawsuit against Apple. Apple agreed to give an Apple credit to users who have accidentally purchased IAP products. The recent iOS update iOS 6.1.2 added a feature that forced users to enter their Apple ID and password to purchase IAP add-ons.\n\nSince the release of iOS 6, hackers had been looking for a way to jailbreak iOS 6.x on iDevices. The process took months, but on February 4th, Evasi0n was released that was capable of jailbreaking all iDevices running iOS 6.0 - 6.1 (and currently all iDevices, including iOS 6.1.2). Despite the success of the jailbreak, Apple is said to release iOS 6.1.3 in the next few weeks which will patch several of the exploits used in the Evasi0n jailbreak. This would mean that more exploits would be needed to jailbreak the new update, which could be months. If you wish to jailbreak your iDevice, I recommend doing it ASAP, and remember to [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3137293&pid=29314491#pid29314491]save your SHSHs[/url]!\n\n[color=white][b]Samsung[/b][/color]\nThe Galaxy S4 has been unveiled. The new and powerful smartphone will have a 1920x1080 pixel display, which to date, is the best quality you will find on a smart phone. The screen is 4.8 inches, measured diagonally. The S4 is still cased in a plastic shell, but will be lighter than many other smart phones on the market. The S4 will have 2 gigabytes of RAM, a 13-megapixel rear facing camera, a 2-megapixel front facing camera, a 2600 mAh battery, 16, 32, or 64 GB storage options, along with micro-SD removable storage. The only unverified piece is the processor, which is the key element in modern smart phones. The operating system will come loaded with the most current version of Android, known as Jelly Bean. Samsung said the phone would be available to purchase towards the end of April, and the pricing will be similar to the S3 on release (16gigs/200$ or 32gigs/250$).\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2jdYz[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Monstercat Media releases 012 Electronic Dance Music Mix[/color][/b]\nAfter four months, the highly anticipated 012 mix from the music network \"Monstercat Media\" has been released. Named \"Aftermath\", the first half of the mix - Chaos - was uploaded to YouTube on March 11th. It featured 15 of the latest tracks, such as \"Grind\" by Stereotronique, and \"Sweet\" by I.Y.F.F.E, Au5 & Auratic. However, many of the most popular releases in the past four months were not included, leaving many fans surprised and disappointed. It was soon revealed that there was going to be a second half to the 012 mix with some of the other favourites, and this was uploaded two days later and named the \"Order Album Mix\". This also included a total of 15 tracks, including pieces such as \"Whip-it\" by 1up, and \"Flight\" by Tristam and Braken. Despite only being up for six days, they already have a combined view count of 150,000 and a total of over 5,000 likes. Monstercat has also as of late reached the 500,000 subscriber mark.\n\n[b][color=white]Taylor Swift \"perfect\" for Zac Efron[/color][/b]\nThe celebrity blogger Perez Hilton has commented that he thought Taylor Swift and Zac Efron would suit each other as a couple extremely well. He said: \"They're both super successful, love music and are around the same age. I sense a plan coming on.\" However, Perez was not as happy about the getting-back-together of another singer who has hit the headlines recently; Rihanna. She has decided to attempt her romance with Chris Brown again, despite being assaulted by him in 2009. She has stated that he has changed drastically compared to before, and she has faith in him and trusts he will not act how he did and carry out the same actions as he previously did back in 2009. \"It's a huge mistake and I think Rihanna secretly knows that,\" he said. \"She's only in her 20s, so I think she's living out a rebellious stage in the public eye.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Lil Wayne in Hospital in \"unstable condition\"[/color][/b]\nRapper Lil Wayne is once again in hospital in critical condition. He was said to have been taken to Cedars-Sinai hospital and spent several hours being treated for serious seizures on Tuesday night. Lil Wayne was found unconscious in his room by one of his bodyguards hours after he was released early on Wednesday morning. He was again rushed to the same Los Angeles medical centre, although to many's despair, this time he did not regain consciousness. He has been reported to currently be in an unstable condition in the Intensive Care unit of the hospital. Witnesses close to relatives and friends have revealed that a number of loved ones are crying around his bed in hospital, hoping for his recovery as well as peers from the music industry not to mention his other family members. Lil Wayne has also been rumoured to have gotten his stomach pumped three times in order to help get rid of unwanted substances in his body such as cough syrup that he has been believed to have taken on Wednesday.\n\n[b][color=white]Music Video of the Week[/color][/b]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cqXk_FRw62Q[/video]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2jdYX[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nThe human mind perplexes me. I was just sitting around and watching a documentary on DMT--a psychedelic mega-drug--and thought about how closed our minds really are. For instance, the comprehension of infinity just isn't there. We know that the idea of infinity is possible, through the study of space and time, yet we still can't comprehend it. I mean, try it. Just try to think of the endless expanses of space, for it to go on endlessly. Endlessly. We can't. We just can't. Personally, this is my theory on the origins of religion, people were scared and destroyed by the idea of infinity, so they created boundaries... God. Anyways, that's another idea for another time. The idea of infinity is just impossible to truly understand. That, alone, blows my mind.",

I think that Ryan \nknew what was going to happen after he abused the sticky system with \nCastle, and simply didn't care. I am not sure what he was trying to accomplish, \nbut his account closure was warranted. Some pseudo quality member's \naccounts were closed in restitution of Root's demise, and I think that's a \nshame, though their actions should not have gone unpunished. I am sincerely \nempathetic for Hawkode if he indeed did lose any amount money due to the \nclosure of Root, and feel he should take action against RyanC in a mature \nway, rather than how other people handle scam reports (Doxing, or otherwise) \nas those methods do not find resolution in a complicated matter, and \nrather only serve to aid in harassing an aggressor in a situation temporarily. \nAll in all, this is one less group on the roster, which means one less potential \nfor negativity as well as positivity and quality. In the end there are open \nended questions and motives that will be left unrevealed, but as a site we \nwill not be misguided or harmed by the actions on both ends of the \npredicament, as we're ever-growing in resources to take lost ones place \nin this situation.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][i]-Kray[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"It is a sad but necessary step.

If they had been more respectful and helpful and had \nbeen more active, it would have worked out. I just hope that this never \nhappens again.

Now, with them disappearing, I do remember \nsome of my friends being in Root, people who are extremely good in black hat \nactivities and deserved to be in that group. Now, reading the news, it's hard \nto believe how tough Root members were and how mean they were to members \nand staff. My friend never mentioned this, so I thought Root was a fine group \nof people that makes Hack Forums, well, Hack forums. It's sad to see how 1 \nslip could make someone fall so hard.
