To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://goo.gl/pxojJ]here[/url]. \n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibbtDZ715LhhGY.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Avatar Updates[/b][/color]\nOn Twitter, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] announced that the size of avatars located in their posts has been increased in size from 70 by 70 to 100 by 100 pixels. In relation to this change, he also recommends that those who wish to do so should update their avatars to a better quality resolution or choose a new avatar all together. In combination with the news of custom avatars being allowed again without the use of Gravatar, this may be the moment some members have been waiting for for months. To visit the Twitter post, please read it [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/402156679120171008]here[/url]. If you wish to read about the latest updates to the avatar upload system, you may do so [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3868144]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Introducing the Extra's Page[/b][/color]\nBoth on Twitter and on a forum thread, the advent of the Extra's page was announced this week by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url]. Located at the top of any forum page in between the \"Members\" and the \"Help\" button, members may now utilize the new \"Extras\" button to read the new page. As an effort to promote the additional and sometimes hard to find pages on Hack Forums such as the Deal Dispute Database, all of the pages that can be considered \"extra\", or not important enough to take a spot on the main navigation bar, can now be accessed through a single page. Also, it is noted on the Extra's page precisely which member groups may take advantage of what link. While some may be accessible to all members, such as the useful [url=http://hackforums.net/shell.php]Shell[/url], others are limited only to Ub3r or Staff members. Something that may catch member's eyes is the second to last column, having the name of the \"Ep1c\" usergroup. Whether this means that a new usergroup is close to being released has yet to be seen. The announcement can be viewed on either [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/401267084648120321]Twitter[/url] or [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3866496]Hack Forums[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]BitCoin Knowledge[/b][/color]\nNot having heard of the currency known as BitCoins while spending time on Hack Forums is a rare occurrence. In relevance to the increasing trend of BitCoin usage around the forum, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] has released a useful tool to the upgraded member groups to follow the latest trends of BitCoin prices, which can be seen [url=http://hackforums.net/btcv.php]here[/url]. The page includes information such as the last price, the latest bid and ask, along with the 24 hour low, high, and volume data doubles. The addition was announced both on [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/401112128079147008]Twitter[/url] and a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3865681]Hack Froums thread[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Minimum Posts to PM Increased & Israel Blocked Permanently[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] has announced on [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/401430719513128960]Twitter[/url] that the minimum amount of posts in order to send PMs has been increased for new members as a result of excessive amounts of low quality posts and spam. 25 posts may take a while to amass, increasing the likelihood of unwanted members being caught and taken care of before they have an opportunity to privately contact members on-site. In addition, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] has [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3863817&pid=36318731#pid36318731]stated[/url] that Israel will never be lifted from the block list again because of the amount of ban evaders and scammers evidently emanating from said country. While it may come to the dismay and inconvenience of some members from Israel, it will surely increase the security of the forum for the remaining users.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iyobmhGt2yol0.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=#EFEFEF][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 prestige points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][color=#EFEFEF][b]Goodies[/b][/color][/url] has reached 10,000 posts\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=589027][color=#EFEFEF][b]Stay Plural[/b][/color][/url] has hit 1,000 reputation.

How are ya doing? Anyone you'd like to mention before we continue?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] Frankly, I don't know too much people so I would have to say, Freddy, Sejskaler, and Rebecca Black Tech.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] How'd you find your way to this site? Did you sign up for debates, or for hacking? I see that you're active in the SRPP.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I signed up because I wanted to learn about stressers and booters, happened when I was on Xbox Live and I got hit offline so I wanted vengeance. I lost the burning passion I needed to learn and the patience, so I made my way to the SRPP section because as a hobby I was always reading about religion and philosophy. Now I am no longer active because the topics are recycled and trolls are finding the section. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Ah, good ole' Xbox. What interests you now on here? Do you still\ngame?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I am just posting around with no particular direction or purpose, however I am just focusing on being a leader in The Empire and passing the probation tests (hopefully). As for gaming, yeah I just got back to it recently. I was doing a lot of gaming on the PS3 but, got tired and started on Xbox once again, and the raging continues. #CoDGhostsproblems\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad you're on Xbox again (Finally!). Do you have any plans on upgrading to the latest and greatest consoles? Also, what do you think of Ghosts?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I have already reserved and paid for both the Xbox One and the Play Station 4, my wife wanted the PS4 very badly so I had to buy it. Ghosts is a good game (surprisingly) I was expecting it to be absolutely terrible but it was enjoyable. I do dislike the overly huge maps, it doesn't feel like a Call of Duty sized maps. The maps that were perfect where the ones in Call of Duty 4. I guess that won't comeback.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I think they're trying to tear away from it's predecessors and create something new. I'm also getting the Xbone. Can't wait for the new consoles. What do you do outside of HF?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] Outside of HF, I work in a paintshop, I don't paint yet, but, I am training for it, other than that I do a little skateboarding, I used to do some free running. I started doing some Kick-boxing but, I didn't go through it, being a father, and just generally gaming in my free time. Nothing much really.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Seems like you're always on the move. How long have you been skateboarding? Free running seems like it'd be hard to do. Any tips?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I skateboarded for a few months, I was never a great skateboarder. For Free Running, I never attempted to jump down from tall buildings or jump from building to building. That is a little too much for me, all I did was backflips and jumping from obstacles. Just the normal, ground based stunts.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Oh, true! How's work doing for ya? Is it like a studio or something like that?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I don't think where I work is a studio, but, the work is going great, it's something that even though it's hard it does not get boring. Like the other day, one of the guys missed a day so, I had to do his work. I sanded 3 cars in a day. I was dead after that.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Well, at least you're enjoyin' what you do. Are you working on any projects here? Or is it a secret?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I was actually planning on making another big thread for the SRPP section, to bring more unique topics to the table but, I lost all my desire to do so. I can't stand to sit here and type long and detailed paragraphs only to have them ignored because in the SRPP section, barely anybody reads the whole threads before disagreeing. The is a major downer.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's a shame. I still think you should go ahead and post it up. Do you have any goals on the forum?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] Actually, I have none, I never aimed to do something on the forum other than just post and have a good time. I guess my goal would be to still have fun and post around for months to come, while meeting new and cool people.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Having a good time and making friends is what it's all about. You have anything you'd like to say before we're done?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951]Evangelist[/url]:[/b][/color] I am not a person of many words, but, thank you for the interview and have a great day and a long time with the Writers.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1234186]#Chester[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hello everyone!

Do any of them relate to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=1234186][color=white][b]#Chester:[/b][/color][/url] Well I love going to the mall and hanging out with my friends! I also love coding sites which I got into when I joined HF and browsed the coding section after that I just started experimenting and really got into it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's awesome!

Are there any goals you'd like to see yourself achieve over the next year or so on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=1234186][color=white][b]#Chester:[/b][/color][/url] Not really. I like where I am at. Actually scratch that there is one I want to hit 500 Prestige for some reason the prestige system intrigues me.

The 169th edition, I believe. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to give a shoutout to Clique and Soulmate.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Two of my favorite members, as well. So tell us what brought you to HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I came to HackForums very interested in the Gamertag section, but when I actually started posting and browsing the forum I noticed how good/big the community was so I decided to make this my home.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I used to be a Gamertag connoisseur, myself. Do you still only buy and sell Gamertags here or have you expanded to other parts of the forum as well?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I no longer sell/buy Gamertags, sadly that section seems to be dying. I've now moved on the SRPP forum and the Lounge. There are some really great people there, and I'm learning a lot from them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I also noticed you have a decent amount of posts in the League of Legends section. Is it safe to say that you're a PC gamer mostly, or do you play console too?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, that is correct. I would say I'm a PC gamer on the most part but that will never take away my love from my console gaming. If I had to choose a favorite though it would defiantly be console.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Xbox or Playstation? Both have some pretty sweet new consoles coming out. (PS4 already released I believe?) Are you going to buy a next generation console?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I play both, the majority of my time goes towards my Xbox though. I'm pretty sure I will get one of the next gen consoles in due time, but at the moment I'm pretty stumped on which one I want to get as they both look fairly amazing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Moving along, you've been here on the forums almost a year. What has been your greatest accomplishment so far, and do you have any future plans you'd like to achieve? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I have a list of accomplishments actually. These include : Hitting 1k posts, 200 rep, and Ub3r. Not that hard of tasks but I'm still very proud. My main goal at the moment is to be accepted into Void during the next recruitment, that's all I really hope for at the moment.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Void, ehh? Not a bad milestone, indeed. So I have to ask, why the username Republic? Is it a Star Wars thing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, it's always been a group that I've looked up to. Haha and no, I've always been interested in the government and things along that manner, I also recently purchased headphones by the brand of Sol Republic so that was a big contribution to me choosing my username.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Okay, good. Thought you were trying to blow up the Death Star again. Anyway, tell us a bit about yourself as a person off the forums.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I just recently turned 16, really into skating. I'm not that good as I'm still learning, but my friends are teaching my at my own pace. I also live in a very small town and I'm a student in High School. I'm a really \"hands on\" person, I assume that I will go straight into the oilfields with my dad when I get out of high school. If not that, then I plan on going to college for computer science. I'm the person in the crowd wearing a beanie, cargo shorts, and vans while everyone else is wearing boots and cowboy hats. I just try my best to be my own person.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You're quite the well spoken individual from what I've seen. Before we go, what are your thoughts on the HF news? Anything to improve on? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] I check out the HF news as much as possible since some of my friends are Writers, but from what I've always noticed is that it is extremely HQ and it looks as if tons of time is put into it every week. You guys at the HF news have nothing to worry about, everything seems perfect in my opinion.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome. Anything else before I go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930][color=white][b]Republic:[/b][/color][/url] Saturday is my best friend in the whole wide world.\n[/spoiler]",

However, the launch was very shaky. According to many PS4 owners and reviewers, the console has had many problems. Users have been experiencing console freezes, bricked consoles out of the box, firmware issues and game compatibility issues. A common problem was that the HDMI port in the console was faulty and had caused many other problems. Electronic Arts issued a statement saying that the PS4 firmware was affecting their games and had issued an alert on their website. Along with these problems, game reviews were extremely low - Sony had posted a statement saying they were disappointed with the low PS4 review scores. \"Yeah, it's disappointing to see some of the low scores. I haven't spent enough time reading reviews, but I would characterize them as mixed,\" Yoshida told GamesIndustry International. The Playstation Network has had many connection problems due to a high amount of users and Sony would like gamers to be patient. Many gamers have decided to switch to Xbox One due to these hardware and firmware issues.\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox One: Games with Gold Program Continues[/b][/color]\nEarlier in 2013, Microsoft announced the Games with Gold program on the Xbox 360.

The language itself is said to be a general purpose programming language, but it will be largely self contained. This means most of the time you will not have to point to external libraries to accomplish your tasks. It is also going to be aimed at experts and novices alike, meaning that you will be able to get to programming in no time. The company has kept most details about this new language vague, but the public is hoping to hear something more about it soon.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Justin Bieber's New Social Network[/b][/color]\nJustin Bieber, as well as other A-listers including Floyd Mayweather, venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar, and angel investor Tom McInerney, led a $1.1 million dollar investment round into a new social network. There are currently no details about what it will be about except that it's expected to show up in the Apple Store later this week. \"We got to know Justin after he began playing our games and tweeting about it,\" said RockLive CEO John Shahidi. The social network site is called \"Shots of Me\", a miniaturized social network for exchanging selfies with people in your friends list. Sorta like SnapChat. According to Complex, \"The app is centered around an ethic of anti-trolling positivity. In place of public comments, Shots of Me uses a direct messaging system that requires both parties to follow one another before a message can be sent. “The commenting thing was something [Bieber] really cared about,” CEO John Shahidi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Not just for himself, but for the kids. He said ‘I want a platform where my fans don’t have to deal with [harassment and negativity].’” The app will hopefully become a catalyst for a less antagonistic and more mutually encouraging world, and when hostility must appear it will be tightly controlled.\n\n[color=white][b]A$AP Rocky Takes MTV To Hometown Harlem Block Where His Brother Was Shot[/b][/color]\nDuring Wednesday's episode of \"RapFix Live,\" Rocky took MTV on a tour of a few landmarks from his childhood. \"Sometimes we used to cut during lunch and go window shopping or try to boost something from Barneys,\" Rocky said laughing, as he recalled his early passion for fashion. \"I used to travel from the Bronx all the way down here and I'm be honest, we used to come to school to get girls and show off our outfits — that's all we used to come to school for back in the day. I didn't have to be in school all week, but once they gave a pop quiz I'd ace it.\" The moment got emotional when the A$AP Rocky recounted that his brother lost his life just a few feet away from where they were standing. \"Ricky, my older brother, he died on this block,\" Rocky said, bringing back the painful memory. \"He got shot right around the corner at 20 years old. I was going to school down the block at the time and I remember my mom rushed [over to tell me] 'your brother just got shot.' He was so tough I thought he was gonna make it,\" Rocky added. \"I didn't think he was gonna pass and but we were up the block at St. Luke's [Hospital] and that's when it happened. February 22, that's when they announced it.\" The struggle is real.\n\n[color=white][b]Jay Z Issues Statement on Barneys Racial Profiling Controversy[/b][/color]\nJay Z (hyphen dropped now) has agreed to move forward with Barneys.

There are times in your life, stages if you will, of deep yearning for freedom and progress. Many of these stages occur during the youth, and can inhibit your ability to enjoy what you have. I, myself, am currently coming to terms with the idea that I just proposed. I wish to move on and make something of myself, yet I am constantly held back by social pretenses and a general lack of individualism. I can only do what I would advise you: do your best to make the most of what you have, and when the time comes--which it will--you'll be ready.",
