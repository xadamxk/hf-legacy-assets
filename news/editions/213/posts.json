Today I'm joined by arguably the most intolerable member in the Website Construction section, and also my nigga -- SlightlyNuclear. How's it going bud? Any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Aye, big shout out to my homeboy Zephyrrrr.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Excellent. Would you mind telling us why you named yourself SlightyNuclear? And how you discovered HF?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Gosh, my name is actually ripped from some guy I saw on a random forum one time; it sorta stuck with me and become my persona (after all, I can be pretty nuclear on the forum sometimes, but not all the time ;) ) I've known about HF for a long time but only bothered to sign up in June last year after hearing some pretty chill things about the community (plus I wanted some GFX but whatevs).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So tell us what you primarily do on HF. Which sections do you frequent?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Originally I stuck to The Lounge but when I noticed the Web Construction section was getting sorta active, I moved over to there. I'm pretty notorious for \"sorting people out\" over with some other WebDevs; it's pretty chill.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] You are pretty notorious for being a huge cunt. So how long have you been developing websites?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] I am a huge cunt, and proud of it. I've been working with the web since I was 12 (aye, I was one of those little 12 year olds running around pretending to know what he was doing when all I did was setup MyBB ahahah). Here I am nearly 5 years later and I still have no idea what I'm doing, but hey it's going well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] We wouldn't want it any other way. You've actually been a huge help to several people and I'm sure our readers know we're just fucking around. Which languages (if any) have you mastered and what advice would you give to aspiring developers?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] I'm super fluent in PHP (despite my best efforts to move away from it). If you count the basic web languages, then obviously HTML and the likes. As you know, Clarky, I'm a giant fan of Bootstrap (not). Off the web, I'm partial to a little C# and VB although I'm still integrating myself into their functions. In terms of webdev, aspiring developers should take a long hard look at which language they want to learn and definitely weigh up the pros and cons of each. PHP is the main language used all over the web, but its syntax is disgusting, it's slow and just terrible so it's probably a good idea to move away from that. Some good alternatives (although I can't vouch for them) would definitely be RoR (Rails) and Python. Aspiring designers are a different calibre of people and they should really focus on current standards. If there's one piece of advice I can give, it's to not ever use Bootstrap in production - PureCSS is a fantastic alternative, plus it's really lightweight and modular!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Terrific advice. Do you do any designing or are you strictly a developer?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] I'm a designer at heart but a budding developer is starting to come through. I'm in love with the Laravel PHP framework and as a designer, it makes the development side of things so much easier. I recently broke away from a designer/developer partnership with my bud Charles after he started college and didn't have time for our projects. I was pretty much left in the dark until I found Laravel and it resparked my interest in learning PHP. After working with Charles for a fair few years, I subliminally know most of PHP's syntax and functions anyway, so going into Laravel was a breeze. Any budding developers should really check the framework out if they plan on using PHP for anything ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Which do you prefer? PC or Mac?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Ah, what an interesting question. Personally I despise Apple for being moneywhores, but they do make good products even if they are overpriced. I own a 2009 Macbook Pro which I find I'm an awful lot more productive with when developing, although my main device is a Windows PC.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I could not respect your answer more. Most people write off their products because they're pricey but you get what you pay for. Now, there's a rumour going around that you're extremely gay. Is this true? If so what do you look for in a man?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] The only reason I bought the Macbook was because it was going cheap on eBay and I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Only for you, Clarky. Your qualities outweigh any other man (apart from perhaps Omni). When are we going out for dinner, anyway?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] You made the right call by purchasing it. After this interview I'll take you to the finest establishment there is, but you'll be expected to \"repay\" me if you know what I mean. How do you feel HF could improve?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Make sure you're clean, then! HF is really a great place and I've met some really chill people in the past year and a bit. If there was one thing that I'd like, it'd be for more awesome developers to come along and visit the Web Construction section. I've known some pretty cool webdevs who've never even visited the section. Come on over, lads, we've got sessions and cookies!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah that's a good point. There's tons of amazing developers on HF that rarely show their face in the programming sections but that's probably because you're there. Do you PC game? If so which games?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Now Clark, I'm not that bad! I'm not a fan of multiplayer games, but I do love to play immersive games over and over such as FarCry 3 and Portal 2. I love a challenge, but those games are both beautiful in terms of graphics and storyline. I'm desperately awaiting the release of FC4. In the meantime, I'm just messing about with Just Cause 2\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Lame. I didn't see one mention of Bf4 or Titanfall. Do women find you even remotely attractive or nah?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Argh, I can't stand Battlefield. I got BF3 for christmas one year and it went straight in the trash after 10 minutes of play. I've been told I'm a 7-8/10 by a few chicks, so I suppose you could say that they do, yes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Nice, now we're nearing the end of this phenomenal interview. Do you have any closing statements you'd like to make? If you don't say anything I'll speak on your behalf and I will include something about bootstrap.\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871289]SlightlyNuclear:[/url][/b] Well flip I better say something then. I'd like to say that you have a really bootyful butt, Clarky. Additionally, I'd also like to mention that I am amazing and Zephyr is a silly sausage.Stay awesome, HF. Aye that's all buttburger.\n[/sp]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Hello Roger Waters, welcome to this weeks interview.

How did you react to your promotion to Mentor?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b][/color] At first, I was really excited (yet very surprised) when I received the status. It had been something that I had always respected in the past and it was something I could only dream of becoming. I'm still in shock even 5 months after receiving mentor status.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Did you jump up and down in excitement? Could you say that it's one of the highlights of your life?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b][/color]  I did not jump up and down in excitement, I was actually in a state of shock at that time. I don't consider it to be one of the highlights of my life, but it is something that I am proud of achieving during my time on Hack Forums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interesting! What do you think of the HF news? Do you actually read ALL of it?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b][/color] I think HF News is one of the best things that we have on this site. I enjoy being a part of the Hack Forums News Team and I like producing content that hundreds of people get to read on a weekly basis. I read most of the articles that are released each week.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Do you have a favorite section that you like to read? Besides the interviews, of course.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b][/color] Besides the Podcast and Gaming News, I enjoy looking at the Tech News articles. I like reading about the technological breakthroughs that happen each week, and checking out all the cool apps that are being created and updated.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What do you do when you're not browsing HF?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b][/color] When I'm not browsing HF I'm working, in class, hanging out with friends, doing homework, or sleeping.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interesting. Do your friends know that you browse HF? Would you recommend HF to them?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah I've told them about the site and what it's all about. A few of them have joined in the past and just lurked for a bit. Considering we are all majoring in Information Technology or Computer Science, I'd recommend this site to them since there are members on here that help others out a ton and I believe my friends could help some members on here.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Could you see yourself gaining the staff position in the future?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b] Possibly, but that decision is out of my hands at this current time.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Intriguing. Any last minute shout outs that you'd like to give before we wrap this interview up?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]:[/b] I'd like to give a shoutout to HF's Number One Black Hat (Aura), Inxy from Instinct, Anima Libera, the Writ3rs, and all of my brothers in The Brotherhood.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

This drops the block reward to 33.425 OMC per block, halved from 66.85 OMC. With this inherent increase in the difficulty of attaining Omnicoin from mining, this may help drive the price upwards, and spark new interest in Omnicoin from users.

As of early September Silk Road 2.0 was reported to have been making a whopping $8 million in sales per month, with over 150,000 active users. Sources now indicate that the alleged operator of the site – 26 year old Blake Benthall, was arrested Wednesday in San Francisco. Blake Benthall also known as the notorious “Defcon” had been allegedly running the site on the widely used anonymous TOR browser since late 2013. Benthall will be charged with one count of conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking - which carries a maximum prison sentence of life in prison, and a minimum of 10 years. He also faces other various charges such as conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to commit trafficking in fraudulent documents, and one count of money laundering conspiracy. It is safe to say that if Benthall is found guilty of all these felonies, he will be going away for an abundantly long time. \n\n[b][color=white]Hackers can steal £999,999 from Visa’s Contactless Payment Cards![/color][/b]\nDue to a security glitch in Visa’s contactless payment cards, security researchers from a University in the UK have found a way to steal immense amounts of money from the average Joe’s pocket. Visa’s “contactless” crypto processor performs secure transactions without the need to insert the card into the reader, thus making any mobile device eligible to use the system. These said “contactless payment cards” are meant to only have a limit of a mere £20 per transaction in the UK, but exploiting evident flaws in the systems protocol, cyber criminals are able to manipulate the system to transfer up to £999,999.99! Visa Europe has stated that they are updating their systems protection to necessitate more payment card transactions to be authenticated online, making this kind of attack very onerous to carry out. \n\n[b][color=white]The Pirate Bay’s 3rd and final Founder arrested.[/color][/b]\nSpeaking of massive cyber-criminals being arrested – The Pirate Bay’s 3rd and final Founder Fredrik Neij, also known as “TiAMO” has been apprehended after hiding from authorities for 4 years. The Pirate Bay allows users to illegal download various copyrighted content such as games, music, movies, software and much more. The 36-year-old Fredrik Neij was convicted by Swedish court back in 2009 on charges of aiding copyright infringement, and has now been apprehended under an Interpol warrant. Neij previously fled the country after being released on bail when he was first charged back in 2009. Sources say he frequented locations such as Thailand. The Pirate Bay’s first Founder Gottfrid Svartholm was found guilty of similar charges, and is currently serving a three-and-a-half year prison sentence.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Government Requests to Facebook Grow Exponentially [/color][/b]\nIn an age where privacy doesn’t mean much, it is a common practice for governments to request data on users of a network or service periodically. Found out recently, Facebook reports that earlier in 2014, they received an “increase of 24%” in data requests on users, the forerunner of course being the United States government. It is said that there are a total of 84 different nations (and their governments) listed on the report. Facebook insists as an entity that it does everything in its power to prevent the handing over of user data, but surely that won’t stop governments from pressuring them to hand over the data.\n\n[b][color=white]Microsoft Breaks The Ice[/color][/b]\nInternet Explorer for Mac, and the Office Suite for all “iProducts”, here’s the best part, it’s all free. Assumed to try to extend their reach, even if it means helping out competitors, Microsoft has released numerous pieces of software to numerous competitors’ products. It’s well known that Microsoft and Apple have never gotten along, so everyone is asking why they would develop all of this free content for their competitors’ products. To use the entire office suite, it is required you have a Microsoft account, but an Office365 subscription is not needed. Microsoft has also hinted at an Android release in early 2015, along with the release of their newest flagship product, Windows 10.\n\n[b][color=white]”Rootpipe” – The Next Shellshock?[/color][/b]\nAnother charming name for another widespread vulnerability affecting thousands of systems, however, this time it’s called “Rootpipe.” Granting root access to attackers targeting the “Yosemite” Mac OS X operating system, we might as well have the next Shellshock - but not yet. Comparable to Shellshock, Rootpipe is a privilege escalation vulnerability, granting complete system control to those looking to control it. On the positive side, not much has been said about the vulnerability, and it has not been publicly released. It also might be good to mention that the founder is uncertain that it is even possible for the vulnerability to effect remote systems. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]New Features for GTA: V[/color][/b]\nA video has been released regarding a cool new feature that hasn't been seen in GTA like this before. Some could say when you drive the car you can change the camera angle to a certain kind of first person view, but this is totally different. Rockstar has announced that GTA: V will be getting a first person mode. In addition to the new mode will be insane animations, cool new vehicle interiors and all of the guns will be getting models that will look crazy in first person. In the video (which will be provided at the end of this article) players get the chance to take a glance at the new mode. The scene filmed currently shows the PS4 and Xbox One version of the game, which is available on November 18. The PC version is also supposed to be supporting first person mode, but won't be released until January 2015.

Most, if not all, the recently released games have a competitive aspect to it. Not everything is done for money, however, for other things too, such as in-game items. Microsoft has announced Halo eSports League, which will be featuring Halo 2. Although Halo: The Master Chief Collection isn't available until November 11, there have been announcements regarding the HCS (Halo Championship Series). This HCS has been confirmed as an official eSports league. Just like the Call of Duty and League of Legends championships, HCS will have help from popular companies. Two companies to be exact will be Twitch and ESL. It has been said that other tournament organizers will assist in the HCS, but none have been announced to the public yet. Following the first season of the HCS, the players will begin to battle on Halo: Master Chief Collection.The first season of the HCS will begin just after the release of The Master Chief Collection. The first season will run from around the release date through March 2015. The established rules, which can be found on the Halo website, state:\n\"Teams of four Spartans will compete in a structured series of online and in-person Halo 2: Anniversary tournaments.\" More information can be seen on the official site [url=https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/halo-championship-series]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]The Crew $25 DLC Pass Announced[/color][/b]\nUpon purchasing the DLC for the new and upcoming game The Crew, you will receive an extra two cars (the McLaren 12C and the Ferrari 458 Speciale), in addition to 12 more DLC exclusive items.

Motorola started selling pre orders on their website as well, but are sold out just like Google Play. Google said they would replenish stock every Wednesday. Carriers will start selling the Nexus 6, all except for Verizon which has not released any details on when it will have the Nexus device. Verizon hasn't had a Nexus Smartphone since the original Galaxy Nexus was released in 2011. T-Mobile is said to get it on November 12th.\n\n[img=543x243]http://i.imgur.com/8TQmloh.png[/img]\n\n[b][color=white]Google Launches Android Media Center: Nexus Player[/color][/b]\nGoogle has released the Nexus 6, 9 and now the Nexus Player in the same release cycle. The Nexus Player allows you to watch movies on your TV from your phone, stream you phones content in general as well as play games if you buy their game pad, which is sold separately. The remote has an app, as well as a physical remote so you can have it wherever you are. This is a great alternative to the Ouya, the first Android console, which allows you to play Android apps on your TV much like the Nexus Player. The Nexus Player however will give you a more immerse and fluid user experience than the Ouya and syncs with all of your Android devices including Chrome Cast. It is currently for sale in the Google Play Store for $99.99. You can see more details here: [url=https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_player&hl=en]https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_player&hl=en[/url]\n\n[b][color=white]New Suicide Watch App Pulled From Samaritans Has Been Pulled[/color][/b]\nAn organization known as Samaritans created an app for searching for words and phrases that could indicate suicidal thoughts. They created the app so people could reach out to them via Twitter, but concerns over the potentially suicidal being marked targets by bullies cause a petition which ultimately caused the shutdown of the app. Samaritans decided to pull the app, but have not given up hope for the idea. They said they plan to make the app safer and less useful for bullies and stalkers, and more useful for those who genuinely wish to help someone in need.\n\n[b][color=white]ASUS ZenWatch Released[/color][/b]\nA new smart watch is on the market. ASUS has released a fairly stylish, smart watch that is also affordable compared to others on the market. It is on sale at Best Buy for $199 and that is a great price for what it offers. Not only is the watch stylish, but it also has many features that go beyond what other Android smart watches have. The watch includes 100+ watch faces to fit your style, and has a vivid AMOLED display with strong Corning Gorilla Glass 3. You can use it as a remote control at meetings to control presentations, or use it to track your steps and other health related features. The sophisticated design of this watch will definitely make it a top choice for consumers.\n\n[b][color=white]Tiny Robotic Scallops That Swim Through Your Blood[/color][/b]\nScientists have tried for a long time to create successful microscopic robots. Recently, a unique microscopic \"scallop\" was created that can swim through blood and other bodily fluids. It does not need a battery, all it needs to run is the energy provided by an external magnetic field. The team doesn't have an idea in mind for their scallop, but they say it can open doors to many new discoveries in medicine.\n\n[b][color=white]Runtastic's Sleep Better App[/color][/b]\nA popular app developer Runtastic has created a sleep-tracking app called Sleep Better. Runtastic is known for their fitness apps, but this app brings sleeping to a whole new level. The app is available on both iOS and Android, and offers many features. The app is free, but not all features are unlocked unless you pay $1.99. Sleep Better can track how you're sleeping, and the quality of your sleep by just using your phone's sensors. It can tell if you toss and turn, and determine whether you are in a deep sleep or not. You can even set a smart alarm to wake you up when you're not in a deep sleep so you feel better when you wake up. This sleep-tracking app is incredibly useful, and it shows how technology can make our lives better, even when we're sleeping.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
