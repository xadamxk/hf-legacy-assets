Seeing there's been an increase of trolling and low quality posting [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated that he will be closing accounts that are involved in the activity. This is something that will happen immediately and without notice. The one warning [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is giving on the matter is the thread he posted announcing the reminder. If you would like to read that thread you may do so, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5152931]here[/url].\n\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]New Ub3r Application Requirements[/b][/color]\nOn February 6th, 2016 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] released the new minimum requirements in order to receive an Ub3r upgrade. Those requirements being you must have at least 250 posts, at least 25 reputation, you must be a member of HF for a minimum time period of 60 days, and if you are denied you may not re-apply for 90 days. With these new minimum requirements it increases the current requirements substantially and will make getting accepted even more difficult. Of course this may be frightening news for some new comers trying to upgrade to Ub3r however with the right attitude surely they'll be able to achieve the same end result.

Before we get started, would you like to make any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for having me, I'm glad you gave me the chance to be on! I'd like to give a shout out to my friend Who Soup, everyone in the Specialists group, and Glitch over at Riptide.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] What brought you to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] I first came to Hack Forums when I was into runescape. A friend of mine recommended me to it and I've been glued ever since. Once I finally signed up and purchased L33T, I started to grow a liking to the community and decided I'm going to start making a name for myself.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Is the member that brought you to Hack Forums still active in the community?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] Sadly no. We kind of lost ties about 3 or 4 years ago. We had a partnership with hacking and stuff like that and then we eventually died off when runescape went down hill. If I could ever be reunited with him again, I'd like to give a shoutout to UGP Jake!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. I see that you're in Specialists. Is there any specific reason why you joined that group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] I am. I joined the group because I think that being in a group serves a purpose. You don't join a group for the userbar to flaunt around, you join to team up with fellow members and make a name for yourself and help better the community, create projects, and make friends. We have a couple really awesome ideas that we're working on and I hope that they work out. I also joined because I feel like a group of 'Specialists' could really make a big impact on a project or a community. If we all team up and make something happen with each of our skills, we could be undefeatable!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser[/b][/color][/url] Mind sharing any upcoming projects that are coming out under the Specialists name?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] A couple I can't really say because they aren't set in stone. The project I'm currently working on is an RSPS. I'm trying to find a few people who will help me out and gather up a team of developers and make it one of the biggest on the forum. I've released a product in which I teamed up with Who Soup and +Haze with called 'Specialist Proxy Checker' which checks thousands of proxies at your desired thread rate. Other than that, I don't have much more information.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] I see. How long have you been in the RSPS business?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] Not very long. Its kind of my second time. My first rsps was a test for about a week or two and then I stopped cause the laptop I was using crashed, too much ratting stuff. I'm going to team up with some people with experience and really get it perfected for the best experience!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Are the people you're teaming up also in Specialists or just close friends?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] Most of them so far are in the Specialist group, yes. I have yet to find anyone else who is willing to join in on the project outside the group. But if anyone is willing to help with developing and setting up, give me a shout!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds great! I see that you've been on HF since 2011. What's making you stay?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] My constant mindset to strive to be better, contribute to the community, and surpass my goals. I've always wanted to be able to join a group and become a leader, I've always been interested in moderating a subforum and so on. Also I've been starting to market things a lot more so that's been keeping me here. Lastly, and most importantly, is the community. I really enjoy the people on this forum.. Haters or not, they're all family in my opinion. I also really enjoy helping people and giving to others a lot. I really enjoy helping others and if I could give others whatever they want whenever they want, I would\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Do you plan on hosting any type of giveaway or contest in the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] I do! I've talked to my group and I've come up with an idea where we will be giving away over $500 in items/cash! We're all going to contribute to the contest and a selection of winners will be chosen from a hat (literally) and we will be giving away a random item or amount of money. It's something to show that we're still a group of giving on this forum. I plan to host it unless one of the leaders plans to take it over, but that's an idea we have rolling.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Have you ever thought about buying a group anytime soon?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] If I had the funds most definitely. But I don't have 7-10,000 in any form of currency, nor will I ever. I have a car addiction and that hobby isn't cheap! If I had the money to spare and buy a group, I honestly think I'd make a huge difference in the group. I'd not sell spots, sell anything in the group. It'd be a group full of special members who actually WANT to be in the group for an yet to be stated reason, and not just for a userbar to get 'fame'.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] Well I wish the best of luck. It seems we have to finsh things off here, but before we go. Would you mind giving you're honest opinion on the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you:). My honest opinion on the site is that it's going to go very far. As long as we don't tolerate scammer's, keep improving every day, and making a difference, we will be the best out there. The site has come very far since I joined and I'm impressed with it's outcome so far. I'd like to thank you for having me and I hope everyone has a nice day! Stay tuned for a bunch of up coming projects the Specialist group has to offer. We're ready to make some big differences around here! Love you all!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866][color=#00c5cd][b]Enterpriser:[/b][/color][/url] I thank you for your time. Have a nice night.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Internal:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the interview man\n\n[/align][/align][/spoiler]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

In September of 2014, Assange filed a complaint concerning both governments, which was considered by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Assange released a statement that if the ruling is against him, he will surrender to the British government. The UN declared that Assange was illegally detained by both the UK and Sweden, in violation of their international human rights obligations. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released a statement saying that Assange should be allowed to leave the embassy and both the UK and Sweden should compensate him for his \"deprivation of liberty.\"\r\n\r\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2016/02/botnet-antivirus.html][b][color=white]Botnet Hijacked and Malware replaced with Antivirus[/color][/b][/url]\r\nThe Dridex banking trojan, which is widely used by criminals to distribute malware, has been found distributing a security software. A portion of the Dridex botnet was highjacked by a Whitehat Hacker, who replaced the malicious links with Avira Antivirus installers. Even after a high-profile shutdown in 2015, the Botnet appears to be active once again. The Dridex trojan distributes itself through spam messages or email attachments--usually Microsoft Office Word file using malicious macros. Once the malicious file is opened, the macros download the trojan itself from a remote server, and then installs it on the victim's computer. The trojan then creates a keylogger, with an end goal of stealing passwords and banking information using hidden redirects and web-injections.\r\n\r\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2016/02/hacking-rfid-chips.html][b][color=white]MIT Develops \"Hack-Proof\" RFID Chip[/color][/b][/url]\r\nRFID chips are in everything now--from credit cards to books. RFID (Radio frequency identification) is a small device that stores data, which can then be encoded and transmitted through an antenna. A major concern is that data could be stolen from them by hackers, as physical access isn't needed to get data from the chip. While the chip is protected by a cryptographic key that could make an inexperienced hacker shy away, a skilled RFID hacker could use a 'side channel attack' or 'power glitch attack' and gain access to the data quite easily. MIT's RFID chip works by having a constant on-board power supply that is 'nearly impossible to cut.' While nothing is 'unhackable,' this chip is headed in the right direction and vastly improves security.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Astute.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taiwan-earthquake_us_56b50cfce4b08069c7a743eb][b][color=white]At Least Two Dead After Magnitude 6.4 Earthquake Hits Taiwan[/color][/b][/url]\r\nNear the commencement of the Chinese Lunar Year holiday, an immense magnitude 6.4 earthquake shook Taiwan, toppling over a 17-story apartment building and killing two people. Since then, an estimated 115 individuals have been hospitalized, and countless others have been displaced due to multiple aftershocks that occurred mere hours after the initial tremors. The incident has sparked worldwide interest, and multiple non-governmental organizations have mobilized in an effort to help provide assistance to those impacted. The United States, amongst other allied countries, have yet to speak about the incident, however, these responses should be expected soon enough.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/nyregion/crane-collapse-lower-manhattan.html][b][color=white]Crane Collapse in Lower Manhattan Kills One Person[/color][/b][/url]\r\nOn Friday morning, workers operating a crane in Lower Manhattan attempted to lower the crane to a secure level, as the snow and winds in the area had picked up. Despite their efforts, however, the crane eventually toppled and plunged into free-fall, where it landed onto Worth Street, killing a 38-year-old man (a Harvard University alumni) and critically injuring two others. Emergency personnel rushed to the scene, where they have been working around the clock to secure the area after multiple gas leaks had been reported in the area through the aftermath of the accident. Initial analysis of the situation points to worsening weather conditions as a massive contributing factor to the incident's fruition. \r\n\r\n[url=http://www.voanews.com/content/obama-xi-say-north-korean-missile-test-would-be-provocative/3179063.html][b][color=white]South Korea Says North Korea Moving Closer to Rocket Launch[/color][/b][/url]\r\nAccording to multiple sources, North Korea has initiated the process of preparing and fueling the rocket tasked with carrying North Korea's \"earth observation satellite\" into outer space. Pyongyang has contacted the International Maritime Organization and the International Telecommunication Union to make them cognizant of their plans to launch the satellite into orbit soon. North Korea has also released the rocket's trajectory to the public as a warning to prevent interference with aircraft while simultaneously informing ships at sea of the possibility of debris due to the launch. The rocket has been set to launch around the commencement of the Chinese Lunar Year holiday, which has caused strained relations between Beijing, one of North Korea's major allies.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

With the May 24 release date rapidly approaching, EA DICE announced that we would be able to experience Mirror's Edge: Catalyst before its release. However, DICE didn't state when the beta would go live. A new trailer accompanied the announcement. The trailer showcases stunning graphics, dynamic voice acting, and a glimpse into Faith Connor's growth as a character. The plot of Mirror's Edge: Catalyst is speculated to be significantly more compelling than its predecessor. Faith's motives and emotions will be explored at a deeper level than they were in the previous title. Mirror's Edge: Catalyst is shaping up to be an incredibly strong follow up to a powerful game. Registration for the beta can be found on the official website of Mirror's Edge. You just need to EA account! Get in on it while you can. DICE has stated that a lot is to come!\n\n[url=http://gamerant.com/tekken-7-gameplay-trailer-557/][b][color=white]Tekken 7: Fated Retribution Updates[/color][/b][/url]\nNews surrounding Namco Bandai's latest title in the Tekken franchise has been scarce until recently. Katsuhiro Harada, the creative developer of Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, released a trailer showcasing all of the games latest updates and mechanic improvements! The trailer also includes everyone's favorite assassin, Nina Williams, showcasing a bridal gown a la Beatrix Kiddo. Tekken is certainly taking a turn into a new direction, but it is a favorable one. It is straying away from the same formula that it has used in most of its games. Harada is breathing new air into a series that has fallen flat in recent years. A console release date still isn't clear, but it is expected to hit shelves sometime this year. \n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-pewdiepies-horror-show-premieres/1100-6434492/][b][color=white]YouTube Original Series: Scare PewDiePie[/color][/b][/url]\nFor those of you that are unaware, YouTube is taking a whack at original programming. One of its first shows is entitled Scare PewDiePie. It will follow Felix Kjellberg, better known by his online alias PewDiePie, on frightening adventures. PewDiePie produces comedy sketches and Let's Play videos on his channel and amassed 42 million subscribers in the process. He is currently the most subscribed person on YouTube. Details of the show haven't been released. All that is currently known is that it is \"part prank show, part suspense adventure\" and produced by the same company that produces The Walking Dead, Skybound Entertainment and Disney's Maker Studios. The show will premier on February 10. Will you be tuning in?\n\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Gladly.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=left][b][url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/05/error-53-apple-iphone-software-update-handset-worthless-third-party-repair]“Error 53” Bug Renders Thousands of iPhones Useless[/url][/b]\nAfter Apple’s latest operating system update for the iPhone 6, users in the thousands found their phones have become useless chunks of metal. The error for the most part occurs in phones whose fingerprint scanners have been repaired by unofficial technicians, but it has also been reported in phones who have received some kind of damage. As of this week, no fix has been issued for the phone-breaking bug. Those who receive the bug get no warning of failure, which means they are out of luck until Apple releases a fix. Despite this, an Apple representative has spoken on the issue, ““When an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorized repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated. With a subsequent update or restore, additional security checks result in an ‘error 53’ being displayed … If a customer encounters an unrecoverable error 53, we recommend contacting Apple support.”\n\n[b][url=http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/04/ubuntu-m10-tablet-convergence/]World’s First Ubuntu Tablet to Release This Year[/url][/b]\nSpanish Tablet maker BQ is teaming up with operating system group Ubuntu to bring consumers the very first tablet shipped with Ubuntu. Interestingly enough, the tablet cannot just be used by interacting with the touch screen, but users can also connect a mouse, keyboard, and a display and use it like a full-fledged desktop. When connected, the M10 can use both desktop applications alongside mobile applications, which can be downloaded from its app store, named Canonical. The tablet that will feature Ubuntu is the already existing Aquaris M10, which features a quad core processor and a large ten inch display. The Ubuntu loaded Aquaris M10 is set to release in quarter two of 2016.\n\n[b][url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35459805]Content Creator TheFineBros Tries to Trademark the Word “React”[/url][/b]\nRafi Fine and Benny Fine, creators of the enormous YouTube reaction channel TheFineBros, are under a storm of controversy after attempting to file a trademark for the word “react”. The trademark attempt came with a video released on the Fine Bros channel about licensing opportunities to let other channels use their “format” in exchange for said content creators sharing ad revenue on the videos with the format. As a result of both announcements, the Fine Bros channel has lost over 300,000 subscribers over the course of the week. Content creators and spectators alike have expressed their worry about the controversy, one critic saying \"They've used their leverage with YouTube to take down channels that were making kids-react videos and seniors-react videos.\" On February 2nd, Benny and Rafi Fine cancelled their plans to trademark the word react after the large internet backlash, as well as cancel their plans for format licensing. . Along with not trademarking the word “react”, Fine Bros Entertainment also rescinded other “React” trademarks they own, including Kids React, and Teens React.\n\n[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ariana.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Changes[/color][/b]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2194640][color=#EFEFEF][b]Nex+[/b][/color][/url] rebranded Prism into Eternal.[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Leadership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2015410][color=#EFEFEF][b]MeshCollider[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a leader of Legends.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2553288][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fiz[/b][/color][/url] is a leader of Eternal.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2776397][color=#00AAFF][b]YoungThug.[/b][/color][/url] is a leader of Eternal.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=710987][color=#EFEFEF][b]Young Thug[/b][/color][/url] is a leader of Eternal.\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5126569][b][Official] Brotherhood Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5128494][b][OFFICIAL] Fusion Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5152329][b]Official Group | Riptide | General Information & Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5159400][b][Recruitment] Riptide | Create & Record a 16[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5070037][b][Recruiting] Royalty [Official Group][/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Related Buy-ins & Informational Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5152674][b][For Sale] Black Lodge Leadership[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5126672][b][Official Group] Enigma - Leadership Spot[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097430][b]DARK - Official Group Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097073][b][Official Usergroup]Dawn[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097281][b]Enigma | General Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5127772][b][OFFICIAL] Fusion Official Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4456035][b]Titans | Official Group[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097188][b]The Black Lodge | How to join | Information[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group and Crew General Discussions Spotlight Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5156038][b][Satire] Renting my group out[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Sales Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5153553][b]DARK Official Group | Group 4 Sale | Make me an offer![/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/SiteNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ariana.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Site Statistics[/b][/color] \n[list][*][sp=[b]Total[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Posts:[/u] 49,699,043 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.15%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Threads:[/u] 3,452,132 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.18%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Members:[/u] 3,031,834 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.18%[/color] )[/list][/sp][/list]\n[list][*][sp=[b]Average[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Daily Posts:[/u] 13951.5 ( [color=#FF0000]-0.01%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Daily Threads:[/u] 969.08 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.03%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Daily New Members:[/u] 851.1 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.02%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Posts Per Member:[/u] 16.39 ( [color=#FF0000]-0.06%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Replies Per Thread:[/u] 13.4 ( [color=#FFD700]~[/color] )[/list][/sp][/list] \n[b][color=white]Ban Statistics[/color][/b] \n[list][*][sp=[b]Last Weeks Bans[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Staff Bans:[/u] 69 \n[list][*][i]...
