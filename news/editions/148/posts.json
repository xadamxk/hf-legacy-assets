Welcome to your interview! I'll call you Devin if I need to though. Any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: Hello, Connected! Thanks for this opportunity. Sure, I'd like to throw a few shoutouts to The Brotherhood, Void, and the Empire. Special shoutouts to my buddies, Connected, Cryptic™, and Kosmos,  love you all!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: When exactly did you join HF? What did you want to learn back then?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: I joined Hack Forums a little over two years ago. I first joined because I was constantly getting ddosed on Xbox Live and I wanted a way to get the people back. My friend who is no longer active here recommended me. I learned how to make some money with PPD and CPA to purchase a booter and I just grabbed the IP's of the people that were ddosing me. It was a crazy time, and it ended up in me getting swatted twice!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Getting swatted sucks. Anyways, have you changed a lot since you joined? Tell us what has changed!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: I have changed a lot since I joined, actually. I constantly wrote with improper grammar and I never used full sentences. I only stuck to Ddosing and RATing when I first started. I wasn't well liked because I was always trolling around and causing issues in the lounge, I guess you could call me a lounge-whore. I had a huge point of inactivity and I decided to get back on the forum. Ever since I started to become active again which was about a year ago, I learned a ton of new things and made a ton of new friends. I am well liked and I also have a lot more respect for people. Im not posting just for the post count now, i'm only posting if it's quality. Quality over quantity is what I like to say.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Are you thinking of learning some new stuff from HF in the future? If so, what?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: Yes, I do plan on learning a ton of new things. Right now I am learning some coding languages so I can make some extra money on the side. The languages i'm learning right now are Delphi and more Java. I plan on learning some more Monetizing Techniques along the way. I'm also becoming really good with malware removal. I plan on applying for MRT in a future recruitment.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: You're in the Brotherhood, Innovation, Empire and Void. What do you think about those groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: That is a really good question! Well, Innovation is a group full of very intellectual people, they are always making new projects which are always interesting. They have a lot of helpful members who know what they're doing, albeit they aren't all helpful. Void is a group full of very unique members who speak their mind and always act themselves with eachother. I wouldn't consider it a group, I consider it more of a family. Empire, is one of my favorite usergroups. They are always having great conversations and the members are great.  I love that they have recruitment often to test out some fresh meat! The Brotherhood, is a great group so far, the leaders are great guys and I couldn't ask for better leaders than Cryptic™ and Connected. The group is just starting out and there isn't many members which is really good because everyone can get to know eachother easier, I also consider this amazing group, a family.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any goals to join any other groups? It's hard to stay active in all groups you're in but the experience is great!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: I do have goals in other groups. I plan on purchasing my own Official usergroup in the near future. It's a great experience to be in more than one group because you get the best of all the worlds. One group could be based off of Coding, web-Development, while the other one can be based off of Science. I hope on being recruited into Infamous in the future, as that has been a \"group dream\" for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Let's talk a little bit about your life. What do you like doing IRL?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: I'm a very unique person when it comes to real life. I am very interested in animals, so I do volunteer at my local animal shelter. I won't be there for much longer though due to a summer job. I love Physics and other math-science related subjects. I love to play soccer, it's my favorite sport. I do run track and field and I used to run Cross Country. I go camping about twice every summer, and I go hiking, fishing, and hunting. I am actually going to go for a run in about an hour!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: I love fishing too! Just went on a trip this week end. Do you make income online or offline?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: I love the scenery of the ocean when I fish. I currently make my income online because I don't have a job in real life yet. I have been very busy with school and not many jobs have been hiring. No one really knows about my online income, although my mom recently found out about and lectured me about it for a good hour because she thought I was doing illegal fraudulent activity. I will be getting a job this summer and I will be making both offline and online income.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#98FB98]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Thank you for being in this interview Devin! Hope you find your path to success online/offline! Any final words to conclude this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=714008][b][color=#DDA0DD]Alea Iacta Est[/color][/b][/url]: Thanks for this opportunity, Connected.

Don Mattrick posted an article on Xbox.com titled \"Your feedback matters - Update on Xbox ONE.\" Don explains, \"As a result of feedback from the Xbox community, we have changed certain policies for Xbox One,\" \"You told us how much you loved the flexibility you have today with games delivered on disc. The ability to lend, share, and resell these games at your discretion is of incredible importance to you,\" Mattrick said. \"Also important to you is the freedom to play offline, for any length of time, anywhere in the world.\" \"So, today I am announcing the following changes to Xbox One and how you can play, share, lend, and resell your games exactly as you do today on Xbox 360,\" he continued. \n[list]\n[*] An Internet connection will not be required to play offline Xbox One games. \n[*] No 24-hour connection requirement.\n[*] Trade-in, lend, resell, gift, and rent disc based games just like you do today. \n[*] Download games from Xbox LIVE on release day.\n[*] Xbox ONE games can be played on any Xbox ONE console.\n[*] No region restrictions.

However, multiple reports say that the new firmware is causing lockdowns or extensive freezes on their console. Reports on the PlayStation forums show that PS3 consoles over 500GB were affected by the error. The 4.45 firmware has since been taken down from the service, but affected consoles will need to wait a bit longer. Sony said they have identified the problem and a new patch will be available on June 27. \"We have identified the issue related to the PlayStation 3 software update (version 4.45) that impacted a small number of PS3 systems earlier this week,\" Sony said in a statement. \"A new PS3 system software update is planned to be released on June 27 that resolves the issue.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox ONE and PS4 Help Amazon Post Biggest Pre-order Week Ever.[/b][/color]\nAmazon announced that Xbox ONE and PS4 preorders have helped the Amazon Games Store post its biggest pre-order week in history. During \"peak demand\" on Amazon, customers were ordering more than 2,500 consoles per minute. The statistics count both the Xbox ONE and the PS4 consoles. Amazon also stated that E3 week pre-orders for both consoles led to a massive 4,000 percent increase year-to-year. The Xbox ONE is sitting in first place on the Amazon preorder charts, however the PS4 has 5 SKU's in the top 20. Microsoft have not announced their launch bundles. The Xbox ONE will launch for $499 in US and the PS4 will launch for $399 in US. \n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Xbox Games[/b][/color]\n[b]Jun 25, 2013 [/b]- Deadpool\n[b]Jun 25, 2013[/b] - Ride to Hell: Retribution\n[b]Jul 09, 2013[/b] - Dark\n[b]Jul 09, 2013[/b] - NCAA Football 14\n[b]Jul 16, 2013[/b] - Dynasty Warriors 8\n[b]Jul 16, 2013[/b] - Turbo: Super Stunt Squad\n[b]Jul 23, 2013[/b] - The Smurfs 2\n[b]Aug 13, 2013[/b] - Payday 2\n[b]Aug 13, 2013[/b] - Phineas and Ferb: Quest for Cool Stuff\n[b]Aug 18, 2013[/b] - Disney Infinity\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nKeemstar plays DayZ with Dylan.

Turkey’s EU Minister, Egemen Bagis, has accused the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, of using the Turkey issue in her campaign for her reelection. On Monday, Merkel criticized Turkey’s crackdown on recent anti-government protests, saying that the police action towards the protesters was “much too harsh.” Bagis responded on Thursday, saying that if Merkel was looking for “internal political material” ahead of Germany’s September elections “this should not be Turkey.” On Friday, German foreign ministry spokesman Andreas Peschke said it had summoned the Turkish ambassador in Berlin, Huseyin Avni Karslioglu. Bagis’s comments towards the Chancellor Merkel had been “unacceptable,” Peschke added. Peschke continued to stress that Turkey’s negotiations with the EU were on hold because of “technical reasons,” rather than the concerns about the actions taken against anti-government protests.\n\n[color=white][b]Dilma Rousseff Summons Brazil Cabinet About Protests[/b][/color]\nBrazil’s President Dilma Rouseff is holding an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the country’s most widespread protests in two decades. The unrest began more than a week ago over transport fare risers, but they are now also directed at corruption and the expense of next year’s football World Cup. Over a million people are reported to have taken part in demonstrations on Thursday in about 100 cities. One man died when a car drove through a barricade in Sao Paulo state. President Rousseff has canceled a trip to Japan to deal with the crisis. Ms. Rousseff initially praised the protesters, saying she was proud that so many people were fighting to make their country better. Since then she has distanced herself from the protests. On Thursday night, protesters tried to storm the foreign ministry in Brasilia. The protesters were driven back by police, who fired rubber bullets and used tear gas. In Rio de Janeiro, it is reported that at least 29 people were injured after clashes between riot police and groups of masked young men trying to approach city hall. Protests continue and several cities including Sao Paulo, Rio, Recife, and Joao Pessoa have reversed the fare increases.\n\n[color=white][b]Western Canada Flooding Causes 100,000 to Flee Homes[/b][/color]\nAs many as 100,000 people have had to leave their homes in western Canada due to heavy flooding. Heavy rain and floodwaters have washed away roads and bridges and caused landslides in southern parts of the province of Alberta. Communities around Calgary, Alberta’s largest city, have been hit particularly bad, a state of emergency has been declared in a large area to the south. Schools and businesses, along with several major roads, have been closed due to the flooding. Helicopters and motor boats had to be used to rescue stranded homeowners. Approximately 25 communities in and around Calgary which lie along the affected rivers have been evacuated.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbirdFfeOijxAv.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Google Given 35 days to Delete Old Street View Data[/b][/color]\nSome of you may remember about the whole Street View data collection fiasco a while back. As the Street View cars were driving around taking pictures, they were (mistakenly, according to Google) collecting information about unsecured WiFi networks. This meant that people could be located exactly with hardware information about their networking device(s) (router MAC address). Google was fined $25,000USD last April by the US Federal Communications Commission, and the UK Information Commissioner's Office have told Google that they have 35 days to delete any remaining data or face criminal proceedings. \n\n[b][color=white]Facebook \"launches\" Vine Competitor; Videos on Instagram[/color][/b]\nVine, Twitter's video sharing service where you can chop up video clips into a maximum 7 second video, has grown in popularity recently. Instagram has added a similar feature: you can now post a 3 to 15 second video of different clips, as well as being able to add a filter. A lot of people have said this is a \"Vine killer\". \n\nYou may think Facebook is copying Twitter, however Twitter did a similar thing when they added the ability to add filters to photos posted from their mobile app. \n\n[b][color=white]The Pirate Bay Founder Jailed Over Hacking Charges[/color][/b]\nGottfrid Svartholm Warg, co-founder of The Pirate Bay was given a two-year sentence in a Swedish prison after multiple \"hack attacks\" and charges of fraud. Warg's accomplice was Mathias Gustafsson, and the pair claimed that they were not the ones responsible for the attacks; instead, their machines were used remotely to perform the hackings, however refused to name these individuals. This was later disproved by computer-forensic experts.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jsSqf056c30Ww.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]A$AP Rocky Readies 'Druggy' Instrumental Album, Beauty And The Beast[/b][/color]\nFor all you A$AP Rocky fans, come rejoice because Rocky's coming out with a new album titled 'Beauty And The Beast'. A$AP Rocky is still getting recognition from his latest album, Long. Live. A$AP, but it looks like he's coming out with a new instrumental album. A$AP told MTV News that he's ready to show out as a producer on this album. This is going to be a huge release for him considering all the work he's putting in. Well, what would you expect from his new album as the producer himself? \"It's really druggy, ambient sh--,\" he said. \"The name of it is Beauty and the Beast: Slowed Down Sessions, Chapter 1. And it's because everything is like classical beautiful music and boom-bap Wu-Tang sh-- mixed together. It's slowed down and it's real vibey, with no lyrics. I feel like it's gonna get people through the summer.\" This album is a definite must for true fans.\n\n[color=white][b]Tiesto, David Guetta, Calvin Harris to Headline TomorrowWorld Festival[/b][/color]\nFor anyone who has been following the 2013 TomorrowWorld Festival, the locations has finally been announced. For all those EDM fans, there will be more than 300 acts scheduled to perform between September 27 and September 29. That's crazy considering how many artists and fans there are. Some popular names consist of  Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, David Guetta and Calvin Harris. That's not all, there's more too. The notorious Swedish House Mafia members Sebastian Ingrosso and Axwell are going to perform on their own! The two will be playing during different times of course. Steve Aoki and Afrojack's newest collaboration project will be included in the collaboration too. There's supposedly 30,000 lucky fans who got tickets to see these artists in Georgia. For any fans out there who haven't gotten their tickets, you can do so, but note they won't be there for too long. Good luck and jam on!\n\n[color=white][b]Kanye West's Yeezus: Will it be a Hit on Radio? [/b][/color]\nKanye released his new album, 'Yeezus' on Jun 18 without ever servicing a single to radio. As of now, it looks like a success. The problem though is the lack of promotion that is given the time his songs are played. Research shows: \"most music discovery takes place on radio, so without having that leading into album release it may reduce awareness of the album.\" Yeezus may be a different case, however. Not only were listeners aware of the debut on the radio and in stores, they were ready for it. If you're friends with Kanye, or know how to get close with him in parties, you would know what the songs sounded like prior to release. Whenever Kanye would have a party, he would share the songs with everyone. If you're a fan of the show \"Saturday Night Live,\" he sang one of his songs from the album, 'Black Skinhead'. It appears that radio is trying to deliver the music to their listeners, even if Kanye isn't directly delivering the music to radio. They're trying their best to solve whatever problem they can.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDUC1LUXSU[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jj0OFp0aBuwTS.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nEnjoy!",

Everybody showed all they're best products and \nit was just friggen awesome. I mean, It's the first public announcement \nof the PS4! Which has been getting alot of bash the past couple weeks \nafter E3 because of it's similar design to the XBOX ONE. I think the PS4 \nis more similar to the PS2 than X1.
