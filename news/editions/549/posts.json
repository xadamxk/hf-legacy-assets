The short video shows the general Xbox shape of the controller with a small sighting of paddle buttons on the back.\r\n[video=youtube]https://youtu.be/WyRyHC0t6zc[/video]\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/5SV1Jn7.png[/img][/spoiler]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#72FF84][b]Notable News (August 2025)[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF44]McDonald’s plans to crack down on Pokemon scalpers:[/color]\r\n\r\nMcDonald’s has recently announced new rules aimed at fighting scalpers for the next wave of its Pokemon-themed Happy Meals in Japan. Platforms such as eBay currently have offerings going as high as $1,000 for 50 sealed packages, and individual cards like the Pikachu reaching out for the burger costing between $20 and $40.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF44]The State of Louisiana is suing Roblox:[/color]\r\n\r\nThe state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox for its failure to protect kids from predatory behavior. More than half of the player base, 56 percent, is aged 16 and below, yet there is no minimum age to play the game, no age verification, and no need for parental permissions. On August 14, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a “child protection” lawsuit against Roblox for “permitting and perpetuating an online environment in which child predators thrive.”\r\n\r\nThis has led to multiple documented instances of children being groomed and even abused as a result of their interactions with predators while playing. In July, a Des Moines, Iowa, [url=https://gamerant.com/roblox-sued-13-year-old-girl-kidnapped/]family filed suit against Roblox after their 13-year-old daughter was abducted and assaulted by a stranger she met on the gaming platform.[/url] The girl had been playing Roblox since she was eight years old, which her parents allowed because they believed it was safe. But the “child” she was chatting with and later agreed to meet up with turned out to be a 37-year-old man named Martin Amaya Sandoval, who already had statutory assault charges pending against him in another state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF44]Rumor: EA wants Battlefield to become an annual release:[/color]\r\n\r\nA new rumor has suggested that EA wants to turn Battlefield into an annual franchise in the vein of Call of Duty.

He said it's going to take five or six years before they get two in a row, so we're not going to get there for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF44]Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Leak reveals how many 6x6 maps there will be at launch:[/color]\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of maps to play on for the upcoming BO7.
