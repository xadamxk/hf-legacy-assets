From now on, members who have lost their accounts without 2FA activated will not have them recovered and they will be closed instead. To make the warning clearer, those without 2FA activated face losing several site privileges as basic as posting in the near future. Furthermore, members will have a notification shown similar to a PM notification until they activate the 2FA feature.

How are you doing?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] Doing alright, currently in the hospital with a collapsed lung.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Oh wow, I hope you recover soon. Any shoutouts you'd like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks mate. I'd like to make a shoutout to the guys in Null, my partner in Crime; Dubitus, and all the users affiliated with The Black Hand.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Could you tell us some more about The Black Hand and how it came to be?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] Basically, Ive been on the forum for roughly a year and a half. Dubitus is a very close friend of mine, I consider him Mr. Miyagi, as he taught me most of my knowledge about doxing. He opened a group called The Black Hand and it was unofficial to start off with. The main aim was to neutralise the amount of scamming and overall internet fraudulence on forums. We started off as roughly 4 members, but then realised we could make it so much more. We now have 11 members in the TBH main branch, and we are working on an absolutely amazing project. We also launched our student program and released our Doxing Bible.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Seems like a really cool thing to do, and I see you guys are now officially a subset of Null, so congrats on that. Could you spill any details about your new project?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah sure. We have had this massive idea for am extremely long time, of a place where users can go to resolve deal disputes based on investigation work. As well as an extremely safe and verified market place. We are launching our own website, which will host a dispute resolution center as well as a extremely secure transaction area.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That sounds awesome, I can't wait to see it in action. So what exactly is the student program? Is it just a general class meant for all skill levels or is it meant for more serious users?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] The student program is a 3-4 hour course in which users are taught the latest doxing and footprint removal methods. We provide a class every Sunday, and collaboration and questions are more tham welcome. We take users from all skill levels, some never tried doxing and are now hosting doxing services and such. After going through the course, you will get 24/7 mentoring via our student chat on skype, and if you show interest and persue more knowledge in the field, we move you up to the trials chat, meaning you have a shot at joining TBH's main branch with the core members.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] So far it seems like an amazing group to be a part of, so much to learn. Have you guys released any official products or services?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] We've released our Doxing Bible, which contains basically everything we feel a doxer and footprint removal enthusiast needs to know about. It has private methods and is truely one of the best doxing ebooks Ive ever seen hit the forums, granted this could be slightly biased considering I wrote half of it... But from reviews it has a great reputation.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Haha I'm sure it's worth the buy. How did you come across HF in the first place?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] Like most of us I presume. Just somewhere to gain knowledge about hacking, realising its more than a hacking forum, and have been here ever since.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] It certainly is. What do you do outside of HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] I do a load of sports. And when I'm not overwhelmed with work, I will party with friends and play some FIFA\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] You can never go wrong with FIFA. What's one thing you'd like to see added to the site?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] Well, like I said when applying for Archive, I'd like to see a more secure marketplace. Which adam replied with, \"not being possible at the current time\", although The Black Hand is about to released the first extremely secure forum based marketplace ever to hit the interwebz. Its completely secure, and I can't wait to prove him wrong ahha.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] It'll be awesome, can't wait to see it. Is there anything else you'd like to say to our readers before we wrap up this interview?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285][color=white][b]Ego™:[/b][/color][/url] I realise there has been a lot of critisism towards The Black Hand recently, and I'd like to address the fact that we are doing actions and releasing products/services to better the community and to assist the members. We are a group based around going after scammers and multi-accounters, etc. There were some posts yesterday calling us \"skids\" and such, which is okay, people can think what they want. But we only have 11 members over the course of 5-6 months. Our members specialise in this field and we work hard to maintain professionalism and excellence when assisting users. That being said, come to me if there are any questions involving the group as I'd be more than happy to answer them.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

I don't care who you are, if you don't have this enabled you are asking to be hacked, especially since you can see who doesn't have this enabled using the Trust Scan feature. The practice of closing members accounts and not having them recovered is a good policy and I'm honestly surprised this wasn't implemented when 2FA was first released. Hopefully members will start taking the right precautions to keeping their accounts safe.\"[/b][/align]\n\n[align=left][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide:[/url] \n\"Personally I think that accounts without 2 Factor Authentication should be expected to be stolen, and it's the users responsibility to secure their accounts with all the resources Omniscient gives them. HackForums users are constantly targeted off-site by people, and all users should have 2FA on their account if they do not want their account to be at risk. If you do lose access to your account or it is stolen, it is your own fault for not using the utilities that are provided to secure your account, and you should not be able to regain access to your account. If you are an active and dedicated member on HF, you should have the common sense to secure your account, not enabling 2FA simply shows that you don't care what happens to it. I treat my HF account like a bank account, and I am confident that it will not be stolen with the 2FA feature enabled.\"[/b][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

A group of hackers, who are now believed to have originated in Russia, breached an IRS (Internal Revenue Service) Website and stole over 100,000 records of American taxpayers' information which included Social Security Numbers, street address, birthdays, and much more. It has produced over $50 million worth of damages. The hackers were able to perform this attack by scouring social media sites looking for information on the would-be victims, and were able to correctly answer the security questions on the IRS website, allowing them to  receive the transcripts. The hackers first began their attack in February of 2015, and over a period of the last four months, over 200,000 requests were sent to attempt to get the IRS information. A 50% rate may sound unsuccessful, but when we attacking such a large group, the results can still be devastating. This was dubbed the largest attack on a government organization in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Starbucks Gift Card Vulnerability[/color][/b]\r\nIn a more light-hearted, non-malicious exploit, a security researcher discovered a way to add essentially unlimited money to a Starbucks gift cards. The vulnerability is not in the card itself, but rather in the Starbucks website. More specifically, the section that allows you to check and manage the balances of the gift cards. The researcher uncovered a race condition, or a situation in which two or more operations attempt to execute at the same time, in said website. To see if his exploit worked in a real-world scenario, he purchased three gift cards with $5 each, performed the exploit, and ended up with $20 in gift cards by the end. This entire escapade was detailed in a blog post that can be found [url=http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/05/21/starbucks.html]Here[/url]. Homakov was accused of fraud by a member of Starbucks' InfoSec team, even though a Starbucks official had told him that he'd receive a $1,000 bug bounty reward. Even though the difference was less than two dollars, it does still count as a fraudulent purchase. Luckily, it doesn't seem as if Starbucks will be pressing any charges.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Another Health Insurer Hacked[/color][/b]\r\nA seemingly popular target of malicious hackers is health insurance providers. A single place that contains millions of peoples' information is the holy grail for hackers. The first health insurance organization to be the victim of a cyber attack was Blue Cross, which had 11 million records stolen. The second was Anthem, whose victim count rose to over 80 million. The newest victim in this string of Health Insurance Hacks is CareFirst. Though they are substantially smaller than the previous two companies, having only 3.5 million customers in total, but are nonetheless devastated by the attacks. Hundreds of thousands of records including names, addresses, and credit card numbers, were taken from the CareFirst database. The methods used in the attacks are seemingly identical to those used by a group of Chinese-sanctioned hackers, though it has been denied by Chinese authorities.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://ihydra.net/hfnt/headers/SecurityNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Apple Provides Work Around for Unicode of Death Bug[/color][/b]\r\nIn recent days, iOS users have been experiencing a Unicode of death bug which has caused users who received a text containing a specific message to have their phones crash. It first surfaced on Reddit on Wednesday. Fortunately, the bug does not result in any data loss, however, it is very cumbersome for iPhone users. The attack became widespread enough that one day later Apple issued a workaround for the bug. The instructed users who received the malicious messages to \"Ask Siri to \"read unread messages.”, Use Siri to reply to the message – then open Messages. In messages, swipe left to delete the thread or tap and hold the message, tap more, and delete the message from the thread.\" While not totally clear why this issue is affecting iOS users, but the issue is believed to originate from the Notification system. It is believed that the notification system cannot render the text, and crashes as such. A report from The Guardian claimed that this issue affects Apple Macs, iPads, and the Apple Watch. Apple says a software update in the near future will be available in the near future. [i][size=x-small][url=https://threatpost.com/apple-provides-workaround-for-unicode-imessage-bug/113067]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Angler Exploit Kit Continues to Evolve[/color][/b]\r\nThe Angler Exploit Kit, one of the most sophisticated exploit kits available on the black market, continues to evolve. The exploit kit was spotted adding yet another Adobe vulnerability that Adobe had claimed to patch. In addition, the kit is dropping CryptoWall. Earlier this year, it was discovered that the kit was pushing a ransomware hardware, a cross between TeslaCrypt and AlphaCrypt, in addition to a slew of Adobe exploits Along with the earlier pushes were some instances of Bedep Trojan, which is used for click fraud. The exploit kid added yet another Adobe Flash vulnerability. This comes as a surprise since Adobe claimed they patched the issue, however, researchers have found instances of the vulnerability still present. The vulnerability exploits a rare condition in the shader class which triggers the vulnerability, thus allow attacks to execute code as they please. In January, the kit added two Flash vulnerabilities, one of which was a day zero vulnerability. [i][size=x-small][url=https://threatpost.com/angler-exploit-kit-exploiting-new-adobe-vulnerability-dropping-cryptowall-3-0/113044]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Apple Blocks Outdated Flash Versions on OS X[/color][/b]\r\nAfter a major flash update two weeks ago, on May 27, Apple added older versions of Flash to a blacklist for OS X. “If you’re using an out-of-date version of the Adobe Flash Player plug-in, you may see the message ‘Blocked plug-in,’ ‘Flash Security Alert,’ or ‘Flash out-of-date’ when attempting to view Flash content in Safari,” said Apple in a security advisory. This is not an uncalled for move from Apple, on numerous occasions dating all the way back to 2012, Apple has blocked outdated versions of Flash on it's software, particularly after major Flash updates are released. Apple noted that there is a way to run the Flash plugin in safe mode for users who need older versions. On May 12, Apple released an update for Flash that patches 18 different vulnerabilities in the software, all of which allowed for remote code execution. Flash users were urged to upgrade to 17.0.0.188. The update resolved four memory corruption vulnerabilities, one heap overflow flaw, an integer overflow bug, three type confusion bugs, and a user-after-free vulnerability that allowed for remote code execution. In addition, the issue addresses a time-of-check time-of-use race condition that could bypass Internet Explorer's Protected Mode. Three other remote code execution bugs were patched.

This news comes from a discussion with the developer with news organization [url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/26/games-cd-projekt-witcher-idUSL5N0YG1AW20150526?irpc=932]Reuters[/url], which focused on the success and future plans for CD Projekt Red, which is based in Poland. CD Projekt CEO Adam Kicinski said that, \"We hope and we are certain that [i]Cyberpunk[/i] has even bigger commercial potential,\" he said. \"It is too early to talk about it, though.\" [i]Cyberpunk[/i] was announced in 2012 and is expected to be developed by a different group within CD Projekt Red. Neither a release date nor expected platforms have been announced; however, the studio has said that it will probably be released on the Xbox One, Playstation 4, and PC. CD Projekt Red plans on focusing their time and efforts on [i]Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] for the next three years.

The bug allows an individual to crash an iOS device with a simple string of text. The glitch will only work when it shows up as a lockscreen notification or banner alert. Why exactly does this glitch iOS devices? The system tries to abbreviate the string of text with an ellipsis, which when done with non-Latin characters like Arabic, restarts the device completely. Apple has responded by saying that the bug will be fixed in a later software update.

Sohel Rana is the main owner being charged but along with himself, over 42 other government officials are being charged. Everyone is being accused of ignoring warnings to not allow workers into the building the day before it collapsed and it has since been known as the worst industrial disaster in the country's history. The initial charge for the owner is culpable homicide but in view of the seriousness of the accident they have been since moved up to murder and if convicted the defendants may face the death penalty. Mr Rana tried to flee to India after the disaster happened but was arrested a few days after just before he left. More than 2,500 people were rescued from the building alive but suffered serious injuries.

The news of such is not as surprising as it may seem as the airline was on the decline since before the disasters and since Christoph Mueller took over in May there were expected to be big changes. The airline is still operating as normal and no flights have been affected. In March last year, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard. The plane is still missing. Four months later, flight MH17 was shot down by a suspected ground-to-air missile while in Ukrainian airspace, with the loss of 298 passengers and crew. These two disasters hit the nail in the coffin and caused massive loses.

The suitcase was originally left inside a locker but after no one claimed the luggage it was opened by train staff to find the body. \"There was an abnormal odour when we opened the suitcase. Then we saw hair,\" an unnamed employee told reporters. The victim seems to be around the age of 70 - 90 and around 4ft 7ins tall. Police have said there are no obvious injuries to the body and are currently examining security camera footage to find the person who left the suitcase behind.
