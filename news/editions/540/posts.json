If you have never heard of Hack Forum News, dont worry we have you covered. We are a team of members from the Hack Forums community who are journilists and writers, and we are here to keep you in the loop of the changes around the site and now even around the world.[/b]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/headlines.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=121196]\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6299355][color=#ffffff]HackForums New Theme[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nThis week, [mention=1] has been putting in work on HackForums’ new theme, introducing a sleek, modern background and subtle transparency effects throughout the forum. These visual updates bring a fresh, polished feel while maintaining the familiar structure users appreciate. Omniscient has also stated that he plans to continue tweaking the forum’s design to further evolve its look—so expect more changes to come.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6299750][color=#ffffff]HackForums Official Roadmap[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\n[mention=1] has released an official roadmap outlining the many projects he has planned and is actively working towards. With a whopping 69 initiatives on the list, members can expect a wave of updates aimed at revamping and modernizing HackForums. It’s clear that big things are on the horizon.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6299640][color=#ffffff]Harrassment Policy Changes[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\n[mention=1] has made the decision to remove the long-standing harassment policy between members. He explained that enforcing the rule was time-consuming and added unnecessary strain to his workload. More importantly, he believes the community is made up of adults who shouldn't require constant moderation. Surprisingly, since the policy’s removal, member interactions have remained relatively tame and respectful.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6299924][color=#ffffff]Convo Harrassment & DOXing[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nFollowing the removal of the harassment policy from the forum, [mention=1] has made an official announcement extending the same approach to Convo, where much of the personal back-and-forth typically occurs. He stated that Convo is not intended to serve as a permanent log of communication, and as such, he will no longer be enforcing rules against the posting of personal information within it. While this decision aligns with his broader shift toward a more hands-off, self-regulating community, it has sparked mixed reactions. Some members feel this move crosses a line and opens the door to potential abuse. What are your thoughts on this direction?\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/statistics-header.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=121196]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#ffffff][u][size=large]Total[/size][/u][/color][/b]\r\nPosts: 62,744,475\r\nThreads: 6,299,909\r\nMembers: 5,662,869\r\n\r\n[b][color=#ffffff][u][size=large]Average[/size][/u][/color][/b]\r\nDaily Posts: 9,467.8\r\nDaily Threads: 950.62\r\nDaily New Members: 854.5\r\nPosts Per Member: 11.08\r\nReplies Per Thread: 8.96\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/gaming-header.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=811]\r\n\r\n[color=#72FF84][b][u]Notable console releases (June 2025)[/u][/b][/color]\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/dPaZftT.png[/img][/spoiler]Nintendo Switch 2 - Release date [b]June 6, 2025[/b]\r\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 has finally arrived, eight years after the OG launched in March 2017.\r\n\r\nNintendo sold over 3.5 million Switch 2's in its first four days, Nintendo’s fastest-ever hardware launch.\r\n\r\nLarge retailers are struggling to keep stock to sell to the public. If you're interested in getting a Switch 2 look for online major retailers. Best Buy, Walmart, Target, GameStop, Newegg, Sam's Club, Antonline, BJ’s, and Amazon. Users in the UK can also check for periodic restocks at EE.\r\n\r\nIf you are struggling with getting your hands on the Switch 2, don't worry. Another exciting option is just around the corner. Sit back patiently for this holiday season on the speculated release of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally. With specs rumored to rival many desktops and laptops, this could be a literal game changer for the industry of handheld gaming. We will touch up more on the subject of this powerhouse in a later edition.\r\n\r\n[color=#72FF84][u][b]Notable Game Releases (June 2025)[/b][/u][/color]\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/uzye6FI.png[/img][/spoiler] Mario Kart World (Switch 2)\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/3BmcsIv.png[/img][/spoiler] Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (PS5)\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/dpsHNmP.png[/img][/spoiler]Five Nights at Freddy’s: Secret of the Mimic (PC and PlayStation 5)\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/v46m7o4.png[/img][/spoiler]The Alters (PC)\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/tB49qUP.png[/img][/spoiler]FBC: Firebreak (PC, Xbox, PlayStation)\r\n[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/tapjSJ5.png[/img][/spoiler]Splitgate 2 (PC, Playstation, Xbox\r\n\r\n🏆 [color=#72FF84][u][b]E-Sports[/b][/u][/color]\r\nCS2 BLAST Austin Major: Running from June 3 to 22, featuring 32 top teams battling for prestige and prize money.\r\nLeague of Legends MSI: Taking place in Vancouver from June 27 to July 12, MSI returns as one of LoL's biggest global events.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#72FF84][b][u]Voice Actor Strike (2024-2025)[/u][/b][/color]\r\nA strike was initiated by (SAG-AFTRA) in July 2024, representing approximately 2,600 performers in voice acting, motion capture, and related roles.
