To the exchangers with thousands in their Liberty Reserve account, you may be worried, but we're not sure if Liberty Reserve will make its way back or if it's gone for good. Let's hope it's not the final goodbye for Liberty Reserve, as this payment processor made a huge difference within the online communities.\n\n[color=white][b]Bitcoins (BTC) Are Now Accepted for All Sticky and Award Purchases[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] recently announced via Twitter that he is now taking all sticky and award donations via BTC.

Welcome to your HF News Interview, Saged. Congradulations on the recent promotion to staff; again! Have you got any shout outs to begin with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: A shout to Pink Floyd and the HF news for the interview. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: I know for a fact that you're one of the old members of HF. You've been staff on HF before as well. What made you register back in 2009?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: I originally wanted to hack/Phish RS accounts. But once I joined the community for a while, I stayed for a different reason. I never did get to hacking RS accounts though, lol.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Tell me about your first promotion to the staff position. Was it expected? How long were you a staff member for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: First staff promotion, from what I remember was back in Nov 2009, about 4 months after I started being solidely active. And it was semi-expected. If you remember iBruteforce, he was a big deal back then and he said he'd try to get me staff at some point. So I was confident I'd get it. I was staff for about 4 months before I stepped down.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Have things on HF changed a lot since then? Is being staff harder or easier than before?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: Oh yeah, lol. New rules, new sections. God damn, I remember when we had a porn section, different language section and allowed phishing. Of course staff come and go and they're mostly the same. Like a fart, they're silent and deadly. And for me it's substantially easier after doing it twice before.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Do you have any particular skills like coding, graphics or hacking? Or are you like me and stay on HF because it's a community that is suitable for almost anyone?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: I'm skillless in that aspect, lol. I mainly stay for the community. I've actually made some good friends on HF that I would never met if I hadn't stuck around.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: I just don't have time to learn about coding so I just developped my GFX skills along the way. It's true that HF is a great community. I assume you've also been here to witness all the 2013 drama. Do you have an opinion on that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: There's always drama on HF. In 09' there was H22, '10 was Vaqxine, '11 I got staff again, 😝.. but seriously, it's really nothing new. You, at some point, just allow it roll of your shoulders.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Two official groups have been closed down (Root & Marketers) and a new one has been opened (Complexity). What do you think about all those closings? Were there any similar events back in the days?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: I think they both fucked up. Break the rules and Omni breaks you. It's a simple philosophy most on HF should follow. Disappointing they haven't caught on by now. But I have no direct opinions about it because it didn't influence me. And of course. They closed the Gamers Group, Coders.. however, with groups being free back in the day, it wasn't as big of a deal.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Let's ask about the most controversial section on HF, the Lounge. How has it changed? I hear that people don't like it in there anymore.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: And the Lounge.. it's been a pretty steady place of intelligence and HQ posting since I've been here. Not. It's changed hands on who 'leads' it since I've been around, from MagicSpeed to Prone, to whoever thinks they're top troll now. It's always been a place of general discussion but because people really aren't allowed to troll, this is the place they feel they can get away with it. They are so wrong.. Just for wait for the coming months. ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Do you have any hobbies/jobs/source of revenue in real life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: I do martial arts, detail cars and do odd jobs. It's a process to get a job after you've gotten your degree, so I have no 'real' job. I also do essays and sell my ebook online.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Thanks so much for participating in this interview, Saged. Loved your answers. Any finals words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: You're a very bad interviewer. That is all.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: You're a a very bad staff member!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url]: You're banned.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b]Connected[/b][/url]: Well damn.

For the 144th edition of the HF News we will be interviewing the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1118885]Penar[/url]! To get things going, do you have any shoutouts you would like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1118885][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Of course I do! I'd firstly like to shout out my boy Kosmos. He's pretty much the one who got my into Hack Forums. Also, I would like to shout out Void. Void is my home, and always will be.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I bet Kosmos will be extremely glad to hear the shoutout from you, as well as the rest of the members from Hexicidal's group Void. Anyway moving on, what brought you to the site in the first place; how did you find it? Why did you join?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Oh yeah, I'm sure they will be, too! Well, I was brought to the site by a couple of friends on a Runescape private server we played called Epicurus. They were really into the site at the time, so one of them gave me the referral link, and it all started from there. Since then, they've all been closed and repfucked. Yes, every single one of them, too. That being said, I stuck with it and continued to grow. When I first joined, I really was into keylogging and RAT'ng, but since then I've stopped both of those. Today, I'm really into the Innuendo section. I think I've found my home there. If I wouldn't have gotten into Void a few months back, I don't think I would be as active as I am today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] It's a shame that they've been closed and repfucked, although we are lucky to have a member like you still active on the site! I see you've very recently been upgraded to ub3r, how long ago did you apply? Have you ever been denied ub3r in the past? Is there anything you hope to do now that you are ub3r?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I just got Ub3r, actually! I applied about 3 months ago with around 600 posts and 30 reputation. Needless to say, I got denied. So, I decided that I would make myself more high quality. I then applied a week ago, and I got accepted 2 days later. I was very excited that I got accepted. So, after that, I bought Ub3r, which was two days ago. Honestly, I just hope to become more trusted. I've had many people tell me that I needed Ub3r, so I'm happy that I finally got it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I got ub3r on my first attempt, I was pretty lucky, so I don't know what it's like to be denied. But yeah, trust is always nice to have as an ub3r member. Now, as I'm sure you know there have been several new members of staff promoted, and two demoted as well. What do you think of the change?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, I thought nothing negative. I know Omni does everything for the betterment of Hack Forums. I'm sad to see some of the old staff not there anymore, but that's ok. From their activity so far, they look great! I've had some personal conversations with Saged before he was promoted to staff, and man is he a great guy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I very much agree, it was definitely a shame to see Hexicidal and Genuine go but I'm sure T3h Hacker, Mr. Kewl and Saged will do great jobs too! Something that everyone has been waiting for now is the promised \"P0W3R\" usergroup. What do you think of it? Do you think Omni will ever implement it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, P0W3R. This has been a huge thing floating around Hack Forums for a while now. Honesty, I think he will eventually get to it, but not now. The reason I say this is because of what Omni has to deal with on a daily basis. He's a very busy man. His user title is \"time is my weakness\". I think he really would like to do it now, but he just doesn't have the time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] And I assume you think the same of the upcoming Vouch system? Although, I guess, there's a much higher likelyhood of the vouch system actually being implemented because it's more than just an idea - as can be seen when posting in the market place.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, the vouch system. I seriously can't wait for the vouch system, because it will keep the Marketplace a safer and better place for everyone. Again, it's the time thing. Eventually he will get around to it, but I don't see it all coming in the near future.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Do you think Omni's updates on the reputation system are needed? Or, would you be happier if he had just decided to stick with the old system?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, I would be happy if he just stuck with the old system. If he changed it now, the reputation wouldn't be the same. I just don't think it's best for the site if he decided to change it now. But then again, it's all up to Omni in the end.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, Omni always has had and always will have the final decision. I guess it's for the best though, and although I may not like the decision yet, I'm gonna wait until it's been implemented before I jump to conclusions about what it's like. As of yesterday, Omni announced that he will now accept Bitcoins for all future transactions on the site. Will you be using bitcoins for any purchases or donations? Do you think this was a good decision by Omni?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, that's a great decision on Omni's half! Considering LR is going through a struggle right now, this can make up for that lost revenue. Honestly, I don't see any problem with accepting them; it's benefiting the site. So, yes, I think this was a great decision by Omni.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] It's a shame about the news with LR. I never really used it, so I am pretty lucky. I can't help but feel for those who lost such large sums of money. Anyway, I'd like to take this moment to thank you for taking part in this week's edition of the HF News. Do you have any last words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid][color=white][b]Penar:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, it sure is a shame, isn't it? Yep, I would just like to thank you for choosing me for this interview! It really was an interesting experience! I'd like to shout out one last group, and that's 143. I think they do great things around Hack Forums, and  I would love to join them one day.\n[/spoiler]",

The changelog is a bit hard to explain, but it includes:\n[list]\n[*]Added new UI for horses, to control saddle/armour/inventory.\n[*]Started to move over various things to a new Attribute system. You may see some new tooltips - don’t be scared!\n[*]Lots of work towards a new Resource Pack system, but not finished yet.

This means that players will have a chance to completely restart; this also, however, means that they'll lose everything they have. While a few dedicated players might be angered by this, most see it as an opportunity to restart and begin anew. Plus, occasional resets are inevitable for faction servers; in fact, our very own Hackercraft was reset just last week. With two fresh new servers, there may be some competition; the Minecraft community of Hack Forums now have [i]two[/i] active, fresh worlds to populate. Which one is your favorite?

Xbox ONE is an \"all in one system\" for games, entertainment, and television. It includes 8GB of RAM, an 8-Core CPU, a 500GB hard drive, a Blu-ray drive, HDMI in and out ports, USB 3.0, 802.11n wireless, and more. The reveal stirred up a lot of drama in the Xbox section on HF, with both Xbox and Playstation fanboys joining the discussion. The Xbox Reveal event was a \"hardware\" reveal, so don't be disappointed that you didn't see \"gaming-related\" features. Microsoft will continue the second-half of the reveal at the E3 Expo, where it's all about \"Games. Games. Games.\" Microsoft are expected to show their line-up of blockbuster games, console accessories and anything else related to the gaming area on the console. MarkMare created an updated recap thread during the event. It was updated whenever something happened during the reveal. You can view the thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3494329]here[/url]. MarkMare also plans on doing the same thing for the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 on June 10. Keep an eye out in the Xbox section or HF news for more Xbox ONE information.\n\n[color=white][b]Current \"Confirmed\" Xbox ONE Games[/b][/color]\nIt's all about games right? These games have currently been confirmed to launch on the Xbox ONE console, with Forza Motorsport 5 being a definite launch title. The games are: Assassins Creed 4, Battlefield 4, CoD: Ghosts, Destiny, Dying Light, FIFA 14, Forza 5, Madden 25, NBA Live 14, Need for Speed Rivals, Quantum Break, Ryse, Thief, EA Sports UFC and Watch Dogs. GTA 5 isn't confirmed yet for the new console, however there is a good chance it will be. There are also many unconfirmed games, such as Halo 5, Doom 4 and the Homefront sequel. You can view the list of confirmed/unconfirmed games [url=http://au.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/List_of_Xbox_One_Games]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox ONE vs. PS4 vs. Wii U Comparison Chart[/b][/color]\nI was looking at a few comparison charts and I thought I might add one by IGN. It compares hardware/features from three consoles and it's constantly updated as something changes. Both the Xbox ONE and PS4 are very good. However, the PS4 has slightly better hardware. Even though it has better hardware, will it perform better? Could it be the same scenario as the PS3 and 360, where the PS3 had better hardware, but the 360 played better on many games? Only time will tell. You can see gameplay from both consoles at the E3 Expo. Until then, you can view the comparison chart [url=http://au.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_vs._Xbox_One_vs._Wii_U_Comparison_Chart]here[/url]. \n\n[color=white][b]Are You Confused About Some Xbox ONE Information?[/b][/color]\nDon't worry! Many other games are confused with the information that announced at the Xbox Reveal. Microsoft were not clear about many topics such as the \"internet\" situation or how \"pre-owned games\" will work. I recommend you wait until the E3 Expo for up-to-date information from Microsoft. \n\n[color=white][b]E3 Expo[/b][/color]\nThe E3 Expo is about two weeks away. Microsoft and Sony are sure to give it all they have to impress current and/or future customers. You can expect a lot of information in the HF News during the E3 Expo. If you can't wait, you can go to the respected sections on HF to get the latest information. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThis week's video is from WoodysGamertag, where he compares the Xbox ONE and PS4 in the latest episode of Tech Tuesday. It's worth checking out.\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJW3mwIPzJc[/video]\n[/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/nc2rUHx.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]No Deaths in I-5 Bridge Collapse in Washington[/b][/color]\nAn Interstate 5 bridge over a river north of Seattle collapsed on Thursday, which resulted in several vehicles landing in the river’s waters. Authorities have investigated the cause of the bridge failure and the cause is still unknown; it is speculated that perhaps an oversize load may have caused the failure. Three injured people were rescued from the water after the collapse. Several rescue boats with dive teams continue to comb the scene but according to Marcus Deyerin, a spokesman for the Northwest Washington Incident Management Team, “We don’t think anyone else went into the water”. Washington State was given a C in the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2013 infrastructure report card; this collapse is an example of this C said the group. The group also stated that more than a quarter of Washington’s 7,840 bridges are considered “structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.”\n\n[color=white][b]Boy Scouts Lifts Ban on Gay Members[/b][/color]\nAfter much compromise, the Boy Scouts of America is now openly accepting of gay Scout members; however, gay Scout leaders are still not allowed. Of the approximately 1,400 voting members of the group’s national council, 61 percent supported the idea of allowing gay Scout members. The policy change will take place on January 1st. Liberal Scout leaders, while supporting gay youth, have made it clear that they want the ban on gay adults to be lifted as well. The Boy Scouts of America celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010 and has long excluded both gays and atheists. \n\n[color=white][b]Sweden Reinforcing Police in Stockholm After Five Days of Rioting[/b][/color]\nIn Stockholm there has been five nights of unprecedented rioting. Reports say that several schools and many cars have been burnt. The riots began on Sunday in a large immigrant suburb, Husby, when a man was shot by a police a week prior after threatening to kill them with a machete. In Husby, more than 80% of the approximately 12,000 inhabitants are from immigrant background, most from the Middle East, Turkey, and Somalia. Police have tried to calm the situation by speaking to local community leaders, such as in mosques.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/u9tvsa7.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]\"Facebook Phone\" HTC First Delayed Europe Launch[/b][/color]\nThe new \"Facebook Home\" home screen replacement for Android devices received some mixed reviews when it first launched, with Facebook partnering up with HTC to bring out the HTC First; branded the \"Facebook Phone\". It was the only phone that was pre-loaded with Facebook Home. However, after some negative feedback from the US market, it has been decided to delay the European launch of the HTC First.\n\n[color=white][b]The End of Liberty Reserve? Quite possible[/b][/color]\nOn May 24th, LibertyReserve.com was sinkholed. The nameservers were pointed at ns1.sinkhole.shadowserver.org and ns2.sinkhole.shadowserver.org. There has been no official statement and most of the information being passed around is rumour. Originally, an article from Ticotimes surfaced claiming that the owner was arrested and the FBI shut the site down. This has not been confirmed. A lot of people are panicking, as this may mean that they have lost all the funds on their Liberty Reserve accounts; however some people are still hopeful in that the site will return shortly. In the mean time, track progress of this event [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3501873]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Original Apple 1, Signed by Steve Wozniak Sold for $650,000[/b][/color]\nThe Apple 1 is a computer built in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak themselves. The machine is 1 of 50 built of its kind, however is one of only six remaining that is in working condition, making this quite the antique for any tech-lover. The computer was signed by Steve Wozniak and purchased buy an anonymous buyer from Asia.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/aOFO7jR.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Daft Punk Reveal Plans to Release Their Own Remix of 'Get Lucky' Next Month[/b][/color]\nThe French duo, Daft Punk, have spent the past four weeks at the number one spot on most music charts with the lead single from their album, 'Random Access Memories'. In an interview with the two, they both shared that they are remixing a number of songs from the album themselves with the 'Get Lucky' remix due in the month of June. \"We're working on some mixes ourselves. So, yes, there will probably be Daft Punk mixes of Daft Punk. Usually, we never mix ourselves, that's something we feel we're interested in doing this time. The first track we're remixing is 'Get Lucky'. That will be out by the end of June.\" 'Random Access Memories' was released on Monday (May 20). At the moment the album is one of the fastest selling albums of 2012. On May 21, over 104,000 copies of the album had been purchased in the UK. Surprisingly, the two were able to earn more than Justin Timberlake's new album 20/20!\n\n[color=white][b]Paris Hilton Signs Record Deal[/b][/color]\nThe hotel heiress, Paris Hilton, has recently signed a contract with YMCMB. Yes, you read that right. She joined one of the most leading rap groups of today. She's currently apart of the same label as famous rappers: Lil Wayne, Drake, Tyga, Nicki Minaj and so many others. Paris Hilton is a known lover of music. She's even released tracks in the past. Earlier this month she states that she wanted to work with Young Money Cash Money Records and she finally got what she wanted.\nCash Money Records is home to a number of hip-hop artists, with Wayne, Bow Wow and Busta Rhymes all working with the company.\nShe had this to say about him in a Tweet: 'Love this song I recorded with @LilTunechi. Love Lil Wayne, he is so amazing! Can''t wait for our new song! #I?YMCMB (sic).' Paris' upcoming release has been produced by her ex-boyfriend Afrojack. This has been one odd selection in the eyes of many different people.\n\n[color=white][b]Kendrick Lamar Digs Up 'Hidden Messages' in 'Vibe' Video[/b][/color]\nKendrick Lamar has hidden messages in some of his music. Strangely enough, he'd rather have the listener take in the message rather than telling everyone about it. He wants people to understand his music their way, and interpret it in everyone's own unique taking. He recently shared his latest music video for his song \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe,\" and he had deep and deliberate messages for the fans. \"It's a few different hidden messages over there but the most obvious showing that even a grieving situation, your vibe can't be killed. There's other little intricate things in there, I like to leave it up to the viewers and the listeners,\" Lamar said. If you're not a fan, or do not know much about the video, Lamar starts out in a church. He's singing about his sins in a deep melodic way. Some examples would be: \"I am a sinner, who's probably gonna sin again. Lord forgive.\" He also gives hints about funerals and other things regarding the church.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zNSgSzhBfM[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/GTB3GhI.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nWell, not quite as filling as the 143rd edition, but solid nonetheless. \nWelcome to a new week, Hack Forums.",

The \nMarketers, in my opinion, were hypocrites. Most of them went around \nscamming helpless people and then covered it up. They also acted all \ntough and like they owned the forum, especially Codevade. They were \nthe ones taking it too far in every situation, and they took it too far \nwith the Pay for Bump thread. I can see why Omniscient was so mad \nabout this; This was creating tons of LQ posts. All in all, It's Omni's \nforum and he has the final decision in all matters. I think the action \nwas a little harsh, but still funny. I am glad Marketers are gone.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1498588][i]-WaterSpice[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think what happened with the Marketers was both \nfair and unfair. Omni closing the account of the guy who started the \nmass-ing was fair, and so was repfucking everyone. They broke \nthe rules afterall, and he showed that he doesn't care who you are. \nYou still have to follow rules. What isn't fair, however, is how some \npeople who participated in the mass-ing, like Codevade, weren't \nrepfucked. I know Omni has more important things to worry about, but \nI think if he's going to discipline some of the people involved, he should \ndiscipline them all.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1564835][i]-Period.[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"Action clearly needed to be taken against anybody who participated \nin the Marketer's Bumping. Removing the entire group may have been too \nsevere because of the money the owners invested to purchase Marketers \nwas now down the drain. However, it is important to leave a strong message \nand Omniscient did just that: he's a no bullshit type of guy and if you think \nyou can fly under his radar and break the rules, you will be punished severely. \nAll involved members received a rep fuck, as well. Many of them have \nrecuperated from this already, proving it to be a not-so-severe punishment. \nA rep fuck is not a terrible punishment because most of the time you'll slowly \nfloat back up to where you were because of the pity +3's. All in all, something \nneeded to be done and Omniscient was the man to do it.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=7744][i]-Peter L[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Although justifiable, I personally believe that Omniscient's \nremoval of the marketers was rather harsh a punishment. Even though the \n'crime' that the group had committed was a direct violation of hack forums \npolicy, the rep fucking of a number of innocent members to me seems just \nsilly. Members that were only part of the group by chance that had years \nof reputation points removed in the click of a button, all due to the wrong \ndoings of others. To further my point, every marketer was not actually \nrepfucked. I question why Codevade and Mr. X suffered no punishment at \nall when other members like +Amaze (who had been repfucked a few days \nbefore) recieved the brunt of a severe punishment. At the end of the day \nthough, it's Omni's choice and what he says goes.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1624866][i]-Muzzy[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"How do you feel about the Liberty Reserve situation?
