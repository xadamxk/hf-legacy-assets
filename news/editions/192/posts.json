As it stands, the group offers no additional benefits besides the option to carry the orange \"Ep1c\" userbar. However, that is soon expected to change as benefits are announced. The announcement thread, appropriately named [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4207431][b]3P1C Day[/b][/url], states that the status is currently only for sale for OMC (OmniCoin) and is priced at $12. The purchase cost is expected to be lowered to around $10 in little time, yet some members have decided to get in on the action early. The rank can be purchased by heading over to the [url=http://hackforums.net/go3p1c.php][b]purchase page[/b][/url] which will redirect the buyer to the CoinPayments website. In time, the rank will also be purchasable with BTC and LTC. For now, OMC can be purchased in the Marketplace Currency Exchange section. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] warns not to ask him about features included with 3p1c, advising users to wait for the official posting which is sure to be released within the next few days. With a new rank and a new award available for purchase with OMC, the currency has seen a spike in price as well.\n\n[color=white][b]OMC To The Moon![/b][/color]\nThe cryptocurrency OmniCoin has spent the past week shoving its foot into naysayer's mouths. The little known coin, which had a value steadily dropping towards only a handful of Satoshi's (1 Satoshi = 0.0000001 BTC) has rebounded with several announcements surrounding it. To begin with, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has had it successfully added to the coin exchange website [url=allcrypt.com/market?id=672][b]AllCrypt.com[/b][/url], announced here: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4192855][b][News] AllCrypt Adds Omnicoin[/b][/url] . The well developed exchange is now grounds for safe transactions without the risk of being scammed in the Currency Exchange section. The thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4195588][b]OMC Adoption Questions[/b][/url] was also created to allow members to give feedback and ideas on possible implementations of the coin in the forum. The infrastructure of the Omnicoin node network has also seen improved redundancy with the addition of several [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4188303][b]new nodes[/b][/url], with a possibility of a block explorer hosted by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] himself, as discussed here: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4192846][b]Blockchain Explorers for Omnicoin[/b][/url]. Furthermore, OMC was added to CoinPayments after a mudflinging session between OMC and VTC (Vertcoin), announced [url=https://twitter.com/CoinPaymentsNET/status/460430703386451968][b]here[/b][/url]. Lastly, the OMC Award is now available for purchase for the grand total of 1337 OMC. \n\n[color=white][b]Viral Dragon's Third Campaign[/b][/color]\nHack Forums' very own [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=23809][color=#00AAFF][b]Viral Dragon[/b][/color][/url] has not been having the best year. Since early 2013, he has been having occasional seizures. After the continued reappearance of these seizures it was decided to pay the hospital a visit in order to find out what was causing these disruptions, which turned out to be a lesion in his brain, as determined by the results of a CAT scan and an MRI. At a mere 1.3cm in size, it doesn't seem all that large but his neurosurgeon still believes that it is the root cause of the seizures. Even though medication against the return of the seizures helps, they also have side affects, including severe irritation, affecting his culinary classes. Several other problems have also arisen over time, including light sensitivity and trouble concentrating. Viral Dragon has been a member of Hack Forums for over four years at this point, sharing his knowledge to others completely free of charge. Being a mentor, he is relentless in keeping Hack Forums a good place to be. Now the roles are reversed; Viral Dragon is the one who needs help. On the [url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-matt-get-a-diagnosis-on-a-brain-lesion#home][b]third Indie GoGo[/b][/url] campaign started by his significant other, complete with a video, several ways of how members can help out are described, from sharing his story on social media to helping them diagnose the lesion and hopefully improving the quality of his life.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Uquxypc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=#EFEFEF][b]Vinnie[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011943][color=#00AAFF][b]-Elision- ★[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]News Notables[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4190522&pid=39678071#pid39678071]1st post[/url]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4190522&pid=39696540#pid39696540]50th post[/url]\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Repfucks[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2095799][color=#99FF00][b]nKRYPT\u001e[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2045862][color=#EFEFEF][b]Expels[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2061560][color=black][b]Athlete[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked for reputation abuse.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=188730][color=#383838][b]Volim te[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605725][color=#383838][b]Bat™[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Active Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1346174][color=black][b]nKRYPT[/b][/color][/url] was banned for having multiple accounts.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2166938][color=black][b]#Florida[/b][/color][/url] was banned for spamming.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][color=black][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/color][/url] was banned for LQP.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2061560][color=black][b]Athlete[/b][/color][/url] was banned for excessive reputation abuse.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=122710][color=black][b]Truth Hurts[/b][/color][/url] was banned for sales trashing.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1141148][color=#99FF00][b]steveds[/b][/color][/url] was banned for inaccurate reports.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2001147][color=black][b]Linkin Park[/b][/color][/url] was banned with the reason: \"Use the Contact Form to recover your account.\"\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Expired Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1450962][color=#00AAFF][b]Reptar[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2238979][color=#99FF00][b]PumpIron[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1370977][color=#99FF00][b]AbusiveExBoyfriend[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182380][color=#00AAFF][b]Natsu‌‌‌[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168682][color=#99FF00][b]√ersus[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1823158][color=#99FF00][b]Luther.[/b][/color][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561331][color=#99FF00][b]D4rKn3s5[/b][/color][/url] were banned for discussion of Paypal fraud.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451][color=#00AAFF][b]Farmer Yellows[/b][/color][/url] was banned.

The thread was essentially an index of every official group on Hack Forums since the beginning of the website and had over a thousand replies. When the thread disappeared, everyone was concerned with what happened until [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274]Skitlz[/url] posted an exact copy of the previously notorious one [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4186780]here[/url]. The thread was endorsed by D3x himself which leads us to believe Skitlz has purchased the thread from D3xus or some sort of arrangement has been made between the two. This may very well be the case as D3xus is very involved with college and does not have the time to maintain the thread. Whatever the case, we hope Skitlz can keep the thread updated accurately.

Today we're here with the HF member Kn1gh7. How are you doing tonight Kn1gh7? Any shout-out's you'd like to make before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] I'm doing pretty fine, almost about to pass out from being awake for 20 hours or so. Shout outs? No not really being I have no friends on HF but Omni's a cool guy so shoutout to him I guess.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's sad to hear man. Is that by choice or are you just not likeable like Grin? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] Nah, I've been pretty inactive lately with late semester grinding at school. I kinda just lost connection with a lot of HF kids because I'm either A. Too lazy to respond or B. Doing something else.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Fair enough, and again, I'm sorry to keep you up so late. If at any point you'd like to leave just let me know and we can pick this up later. If it's ok with you, please share with the readers how you stumbled across HF.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] Oh wow, that was quite a few years ago. I first came upon HF to essentially find people to boost with in Halo 3. That was my only intention and wasn't really interested in anything else they had. I didn't really care about any other game than Halo or hacking, computing or coding sections on HF. From the Halo section, I gradually expanded myself into other sections where I really became sucked into the realm and kinda did learn what I was really interested in.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So what were some of your interests?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] Well after venturing out of the Halo/Xbox section, I found myself in the computing section a lot more. This was around the same I got my first computer so I was super interested in what I could do with my shit laptop. I learned how to build a computer from top to bottom and familiarized myself with all the different components that make up a computer. From there, I ventured into the monetizing section where I \"attempted\" to make a decent sum of cash to afford my gaming addiction. I'd say the year I spent in online monetizing was a... unpleasant one to say the least.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Lol, hey at least you gave it a go. Now I could be wrong, but were you a staff member at one point in time? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] I get that question so many times, and I'm starting to think the only reason you picked to interview me was because you thought I was the ex-staff member. In short, NO I am not Kn1ght who is the person you're talking about. However I think sometimes members mistake me a lot for him giving me little more respect than I deserve. ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahaha. I'm just confirming, and I'm glad I did. You mentioned earlier that you're relatively inactive, why is this? Oh and that’s not why you were selected, if that had any relevance I would have confirmed it prior to interviewing you.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] Well besides school, I recently bought my first gaming PC so I spent more time in games than on HF and HF's PC gaming community is pretty inactive so I didn't take interested in the PC gaming section. I kinda hate to say it, but HF is getting dull to me. I'll keep my hipster rant short but HF has changed and evolved soooo much from when I first signed up 4 years ago. I don't really consider myself a old legacy member but even then the small, packed community we once were has turned into a pit of annoying children, self-proclaimed big shots, and new sign ups with the sole intention to get those \"MAKE $2000 DAY\" ebooks we all love.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I understand, I'm sure most of us do. Are you in high school or post secondary?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] I'm just finishing up my Freshman year in college!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh nice, what are you studying? Or are you just upgrading right now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] I'm majoring in Health Administration. However most of my classes were just the regular core classes for my freshman year. It's funny because as I was filling out my college application, I made the sudden change into the healthcare field. I'd love to work in a hospital setting where I can help people get better. But my second choice would of for sure been computer engineering.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] You don't get to help save lives with a Degree in Engineering. What specific job are you looking for in the health-care sector?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] My job entitles me to be basically the \"manager\" of a hospital. So really in essence that's what it is. The job comes with long hours and stressful situations. No doubt my hair will be greying the following year.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That will be a very stressful yet rewarding career. I hope you're ready for all of the responsibility! \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] Well I'll know soon if my choice becomes a reality. The selection process for my program is apparently very competitive. I'll know for sure by the end of June. If it fails, honestly I don't really know what to do. The pre requisites were health classes like Anatomy, Biology, Maths, and Chemistry and I'd have to take a whole other set of core classes if I want to pursue a career in computer engineering. Maybe I'll find another healthcare program so I won't render my credits useless.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good call. Well, I'd like to wish you the best with that and I'd also like to thank you for staying up with us this late to get this interview done. You are, a gentleman and a scholar. If you have any closing statements you'd like to make, now is the time to do so. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=382745][b]Kn1gh7:[/b][/url] it was a pleasure and definitely a surprise at 3:30 in the morning. Well I'd just like to say to any new person on HF reading this, despite what I said, to cherish what HF has to offer. There is so many opportunities and new things to discover. Perhaps you'll find something you'll really enjoy like I did. Maybe a career field that you'd like to spend your days working in. Or better yet, make new friends.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1869260]Wizard[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF news.

Never really thought about it. I got into it by just visiting all the sections, and I saw the appraisals section. I enjoyed anything to do with social mediums / online accounts. I already had a fair idea of the market of accounts, so I begun appraising items for people.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Fair enough!

For a while I didn't really expand on HF and stuck to the marketplace where I'd sell items. I'm becoming more active in The Lounge, the Innuendo forum, and Pet Peeve. I occasionally go to the depths of the beginner hacking section also to help all the new ones out.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad you've found your favorites.

Meaning I'm on the computer most of the time. I enjoy editing videos, playing console games, and researching security flaws and vulnerabilities. On the rare occasion I go outside, I like to bike ride, or chill with friends.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  What games are you currently enjoying on the console? Microsoft or Sony? Xbox One or Playstation Four?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1869260]Wizard[/url]:[/b] I'm a Sony gamer as most could probably tell since I sell a lot of PSN accounts. The games I usually play are GTA V, Black Ops 2, Far Cry 3, and Payday 2. I'll definitely be buying the PS4 when there's more games out for it. Not really a fan of the Xbox One from what I've seen\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] How are you enjoying PayDay? The first one in the series was.. eh, in my opinion. That's true, about the Xbox One. Haven't seen a system seller yet. Do you play anything on the PC?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1869260]Wizard[/url]:[/b][/color] Payday isn't my favorite game, the shooting isn't very realistic compared to something like Bo2. I did play LoL for a bit, and I sucked. TF2 I also played, and some other Steam games for a while. However my current computer needs a huge upgrade and it can't really run any PC games unfortunately.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Luckily league can run decently even on a toaster. Have you gave a thought about returning to it? It's pretty dang popular, as you probably know. Anyways, what got you into selling online accounts/social mediums?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1869260]Wizard[/url]:[/b][/color] I think I will return to it when I'm all fully setup with my new system etc. I've been doing social mediums / online accounts since probably late 2011 / early 2012. I never really used forums as I'd heard a lot of horror stories about how they were filled with scammers etc. So I just used AIM, Skype and on site messaging to contact the people about deals. Since joining HF I've made a lot more sales and deals and have only had a few serious scams. The nature of the marketplace certainly is changing, but I foresee a huge boost in the entire section in the near future. Prices for decent accounts now have skyrocketed.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What's the most desired type of social medium as of right now? Tumblrs, Twitters or Gamertags?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1869260]Wizard[/url]:[/b][/color] Decent Gamertags still remain the medium that everyone wants. Tumblr's used to be worth a lot, but due to the high risk of them getting banned and the snitch on HF the prices have decreased. Junior / Maximum has been the only one IMO to bring decent tags to the marketplace in the last few months. I've only owned two or three original tags since I don't own an Xbox console.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad that there's still hope for gamertags. Any finals words for this interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1869260]Wizard[/url]:[/b][/color] I think I've covered most things I want to say.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to shoutout my BFF Cody (of 143), Sudsy, Reset, Kernel, and yourself, 630.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Quite an interesting list of people, how did you get to know them? I heard iSudsy is BBFs with the user Kray... Care to enlighten us on that relationship?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] Most of the people listed I've met over Hackercraft. Sudsy has been my friend for a few years, I met him over Playstation. Sudsy recently found out Kray lived near him so Kray started paying Sudsy to be his friend. That's all I know about that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So the rumors of them being in a relationship is false?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] I cannot confirm nor deny that statement.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Alright, I understand. So what do you do outside of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] I go on some other forums, play Minecraft, sometimes play PS4. Nothing too exciting, I really don't do much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Alright, I understand.

Do you go to school or play any type of sports?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] I'm done with school, I don't play any sports. I am a huge Boston Red Sox fan though. Go Sox!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] All about them White Sox... So I've heard you run a mine craft server, wanna tell me about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] I run a hub server called TreePunch with 2 of my friends, which are also on HackForums. Currently, we have 4 servers: Prison, Survival, Creative, and Parkour. It's not a huge server, but it is growing every day. If you would like to check it out, the IP is treepun.ch!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] From personal experience I can say it's pretty fun. I heard there are changes coming, what can we expect?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] We made the mistake of expanding from just a Prison server to a hub server. At the time we thought it was a good idea, but I can honestly say it was a huge mistake. On average we had around 40 people online in the evenings, when we expanded to a hub server we dropped down to 20-30. We plan on making it just a Prison server again but we have a bunch of custom stuff to make up for it! As of now we don't have an exact date of when it's happening, just in the near future!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] It's weird how you lost players with the addition of new features, just doesn't make sense to me. I want to add that I've destroyed the parkour a number of times now and it's pretty fun. How do you like Hacker Craft? You seem pretty active.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] That's exactly how we felt. We thought it would help our server grow but in reality it spread out our players and a bunch of them stopped playing. I've seen you playing Parkour before, you seem to like it a lot. On to HackerCraft, I enjoy the server a lot. Making bases and protecting them is what I do best. I wish Factions could come back as the current plugins don't allow any type of griefing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] How did you feel about the recent Hacker Craft reset? A lot was lost and a lot of players are upset over it.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] I was really excited about it. Before the reset, the 666 factions dominated the server. We had the biggest base and the best players on the server in it. We were untouchable. It gets boring being the wealthiest people on the server after a while, so the reset made it fun again! I personally lost a LOT of stuff, but the fact that I would have something to do on the server again made it worth losing everything.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] The reset was bittersweet. So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] Well my mate Lovol signed up here and would constantly talk about it so I decided to come and check it out. Little did I know I would be hooked on it soon after. I haven't left since. This a little over a year ago if I remember correctly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] On a scale of 1-10 ow has your overall Hack Forums experience been?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] There's no reason to not give it a 10. I love spending money just as much as I love earning money. I've done a bunch of deals on HF from buying Spotify accounts to selling HackerCraft awards. Luckily I've never been scammed which makes me love the site that much more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could change one thing about the site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] There are not enough members like Cody of 143. He is a high quality member but lacks arms. Yes, that's right. He does not have arms. That is probably why he is so high quality.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I think that will warp up this interview. Do you have any concluding remarks?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sox:‎[/b][/color][/url] Hmm, I'd like to thank you for taking 5 hours out of your time to interview me. It was a great life changing experience that I will cherish until the day I die.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Cody:[/b][/color][/url] 630 please interview me!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] No.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

They also said that it is out in the wild, meaning it is being used actively to target and infect people. The attacks are very limited, but they are aimed at certain groups of traffic. The exploit allows for remote code execution, which is one of the worst type of exploits. It allows other people to more or less do whatever they wish with someone's computer, most often infecting them to establish a permanent method of accessing the hijacked computer. This exploit bypasses default Windows protection abilities like DEP and ASLR, which makes it very bad. Overall, the idea is based off of a former bug which was patched. This malware was seen targeting financial and defense intuitions within the United States. The group with the vulnerability has been known to have other zero-day exploits in the past. FireEye, the security firm who uncovered the exploit said, \"The APT [advanced persistent threat] group responsible for this exploit has been the first group to have access to a select number of browser-based 0-day exploits (e.g. IE, Firefox, and Flash) in the past.\" This is a huge problem for Microsoft, and hopefully we will see a fix soon. \n\n[color=white][b]Verizon's Shocking Data[/b][/color]\nIn the past the hacking of computers and servers was a lot less serious than it is today. This activity has shifted its focus to a much more economic goal. They are basically stealing right out of the pockets of many unsuspecting people, but now they are much harder to catch. Unlike someone running away from a robbery seen, there aren't many ways to catch a person who just compromised a website and stole money or data. These attacks are changing daily in their method, with some of the most popular being POS intrusion and general website hacking. Each of these attacks has their own niche, so to speak. The POS intrusion typically targets retail services, while website hacks are aimed at financial institutions. Something the cryptocurrency community sees far too often. Verizon's study divided attacks up into 9 groups and monitored their frequency from 2004 to 2013. Another shocking revelation is that malware and attacks like these are growing at a faster rate than those who are trying to stop it. This is a horrible issue which shows the current state of affairs of the Internet as a whole, where stealing is so commonplace. \n\nFor those of you who are interested, check out the report here:\nhttp://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/?utm_source=earlyaccess&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=DBIR\n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nI urge everyone who has friends who aren't tech savvy to give them the basic security information which isn't as readily available to the mainstream community as you may think. While you may think of yourself as a nerd, you can protect those you care about just by spreading the information which many are not privy about. Get them to install a free antivirus and educate them on the basics of Internet security and how they should handle their data.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]France Says Bitcoin Revenue Must Be Declared to Tax Authorities[/color][/b]\nFollowing the US's recent classification of Bitcoin as property, France seems to be following a similar path by requiring Bitcoiners to report profits from Bitcoin to France's Ministry of Economy and Finance. This is an interesting development since France doesn't actually recognize Bitcoin in contrast to the US' classifcation of Bitcoin as property. To justify this, a Ministry spokeperson told France's local daily newspaper [i]Le Monde[/i], \"All taxpayers are required to declare all their revenues, including those originating from abroad. This said, there is a certain tolerance [from the state authorities] regarding minor and irregular revenues, for instance from occasional sales.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Iranians Fight Against Rising Fuel Prices[/color][/b]\nIran faced a large surge in fuel prices following president Hassan Rouhani's decision to slash fuel subsidies. These subsidy cuts will affect petrol, diesel, and compressed natural gas. While at the time of writing, the new prices for the fuels had not been announced, this will serve as a test of the people's support for the President in a country already embattled by inflation spurred by trade sanctions. Iranian police have also been placed on high alert following riots at the pumps after Iran's first rations on the subsidized fuel in 2007. Even if there are no riots, the jump in inflation could hit the Iranian people hard. In 2010, former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's cut of subsidies for fuel, food, and utilities caused a jump in inflation from 8.8 percent, a record low, to almost 40 percent by the end of his term, and potentially contributed to the end of his presidency.\n\n[b][color=white]S&P 500 May Be Heading Towards a Bearish Outlook[/color][/b]\nAfter peaking near 1900 last week, the S&P 500 has shown a fairly steady decline with hits in nearly all sectors of the market, with the only exception being utilities, which showed a small gain. This could be a precursor to the future of US markets across the board as investors and market analysts have started predicting bearish conditions, with some analysts even pointing towards Exchange-Traded Funds as a possible catalyst for the market's turn.\n\n[b][color=white]Fed May Push Gold to $5000[/color][/b]\nPeter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, suggested that inflation may push the price of gold to $5000, a belief that Schiff has been outspoken about since 2011. However, despite his predictions, gold finally managed to pass a high point of a mere $1900 on April 25th. Schiff remains adamant that gold may hit $5000, citing the 2013 selloff and calling it \"completely out of touch with reality,\" and stated his suspicion that the aftermath of the selloff may be the catalyst for gold to reach new heights.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Key Regulator in Pacemakers of Our Brain and Heart Discovered[/color][/b]\nBiologists from the University of Waterloo have discovered how an outer shield over T-type channels change the electrochemical signaling of brain and heart cells. Understanding how these shields work will help researchers develop a new class of drugs for treating epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The researchers discovered T-type channels in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, can shift from using calcium ions to using sodium ions to generate the electrical signal because of an outer shield of amino acids called a turret situated above the channel's entrance. Low voltage T-type channels generate tiny pulses of current at regular intervals by passing positively-charged cations across the cell's membrane through a channel. The channels are, however, very selective, allowing just one sodium ion to pass for every 10,000 calcium ions. The resulting signals produced by this transfer of cations are what support the contraction of our heart muscles and neuronal firing in parts in the brain, which helps regulate our sleep-wake cycle.\n\n[b][color=white]Star is Discovered to Be A Close Neighbor of the Sun and the Coldest of Its Kind[/color][/b]\nA brown dwarf star that appears to be the coldest of its kind has been discovered by a Penn State University astronomer using NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Images from the space telescopes also pinpointed the object's distance at 7.2 light-years away, making it the fourth-closest system to our Sun. Brown dwarfs start their lives like stars as collapsing balls of gas, but they lack the mass to burn nuclear fuel and radiate starlight. The new found brown dwarf, named WISE J085510.83-071442.5, has a temperature between negative 54 and 9 degrees Fahrenheit. Previous record holders for coldest brown dwarfs, also found by WISE and Spitzer, were about room temperature.\n\n[b][color=white]Almost Half of Homeless Men Had Traumatic Brain Injury in Their Lifetime[/color][/b]\nAccording to a study from St. Michael's Hospital, almost half of all homeless men had suffered at least one traumatic brain injury in their life and 87% of those injuries occurred before the men lost their homes. The major causes of TBIs were assaults, motor vehicle collisions, and falls. The lead researcher, Dr.Topolovec-Vranic, said that it's important for health care providers and others who work with homeless people to be aware of any history of TBI because of the links between such injuries and mental health issues, substance abuse, seizures, and general poorer physical health. The recognition that a TBI during childhood could lead someone to homelessness may challenge the idea that homelessness is a conscious decision made by those individuals.\n\n[b][color=white]Chernobyl's Birds Adapting to Ionizing Radiation[/color][/b]\nAccording to a finding published in the journal Functional Ecology, birds in the zone around Chernobyl are adapting to long-term exposure to radiation. The study is the first evidence that wild animals adapt to ionizing radiation and the first to show that birds which produce most pheomelanin, have more problems coping with radiation exposure. Laboratory experiments have shown that humans and other animals can adapt to radiation and that prolonged exposure to low doses of radiation increases organisms' resistance to larger, subsequent doses. The birds around the Chernobyl area have adapted to the radiation and may even begin to benefit from the it.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]YouTube for Android Now Generates Playlists of Your Favorite Artists[/b][/color]\nOver the years, making YouTube playlists was always a hassle for most people, but not anymore with YouTube Mix. YouTube Mix allows you to type in an artist's name and then it will generate a playlist based on that artist. As of now, the playlists are mostly Vevo videos of known artists so you can't really binge out on super unknown acts at this point. While it seems to work for most Android devices, it is unknown whether it works on all. \n\n[color=white][b]Guests at Chinese Hotel can use Smartphone Free during their Stay[/b][/color]\nMost hotels will give you those little shampoos or chocolate for staying with them, but at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, they allow you to use smartphones during your stay. The Hong Kong-based hotel installed the handsets in each of its 381 rooms, which allows guests to use the phone free while staying there. The phone allows unlimited data and calls to places such as US, UK, Australia, and more for free. You can enter in your Google credentials to download any app you want and at the end of your stay, you just press the clear data button and all your personal info will be gone. Perhaps more hotels will take this route in the future, making it easier for guests to navigate and contact people.\n\n[color=white][b]Hulu Attempting to Block Users who use VPNs to Access their Streaming Service[/b][/color]\nMany people outside the US use VPNs (virtual private networks) to circumvent the ban that Hulu has in place for streaming outside of the US. Hulu is now coming down on people using these VPNs by blocking connections from popular VPN services, whether or not the people are just using VPNs for privacy or not. Hulu is saying that folks from the US should \"disable your anonymizer.\" This leaves a lot of people in a bind trying to access the service, but there will be another way to access it eventually. Hulu has not spoken more on this issue.\n\n[color=white][b]Android Beefs Up its Restaurant Search[/b][/color]\nAndroid has always included most restaurants near the user when searching, but it useless if you cannot afford the closest place to you and you want some quick food. Google is now trying to help people find more affordable and popular options by beefing up the search in the phone. The new search allows you to search in your area by price, when they're open, rating, and cuisine style. The search works for hotels too and follows the same guidelines. The new search is currently only for US customers, but may be branching out soon.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

This new direction was described by Raines as \"Gamestop 3.0\" and the company is expected to open around 250 AT&T-authorized mobile stores and 25 stores geared towards the sales of Apple products. The change in the company is also said to be an adaption in the industry given the decline of physical copies of video games and the increase of mobile gaming.\n\n[color=white][b]Jetpack Spotted in Grand Theft Auto V Source Code[/b][/color]\nGrand Theft Auto fans and players may be able to own a jetpack in the game in the near future. According to a Se7enSins forum user named \"Chr0m3 x MoDz,\"  references to jetpacks in the most recent 1.12 update have been discovered. Another reference in the update reveals that players will be able to wield guns while using this jetpack. Jetpacks have been rumored to be part of a DLC pack since the game was launched and references to jetpacks in the game have been found in a mysterious image in the game. Jetpacks were available in a DLC pack in the previous Grand Theft Auto IV game which shows that Rockstar may be up to the same thing in its sequel.\n\n[color=white][b]H1Z1 Monetization Details Revealed[/b][/color]\nThe president of Sony Entertainment Online, John Smedley, revealed details on H1Z1's monetization plans this week on the game's official subreddit. In his subreddit post, he outlined a number of micro-transaction guidelines that the H1Z1 team will most likely be following, which will be inspired by fan feedback. \"We will be selling wearables. We felt like this will be a good, fair revenue generator,\" he said. \"However, we recognize how important finding wearables in the world is so you’ll be able to find and craft a lot of stuff. We agree that’s something important. We’ve also come up with a pretty awesome idea to let players who kill other players loot stuff. So if a player has a black ski mask and gets killed by another player, that player can wear the ski mask for a few deaths. (We have durability in the game. Station Cash wearables won’t degrade at all, but when you loot something, it will degrade.) Please note the original player always keeps their SC purchased wearables.\" Smedly goes on to say that the team is highly against the sale of guns, ammo, and anything that will give players an aid, or boost over other players.\n\n[color=white][b]Release Dates for the Week of April 27, 2014:[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Nintendo 3DS, PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Wii U -  April 29, 2014\n[*]Daylight -  PlayStation 4, PC - April 29, 2014\n[*]Child of Light - PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U - April 30, 2014\n[*]Kirby: Triple Deluxe - Nintendo 3DS - May 2, 2014\n[*]Mario Golf World Tour - Nintendo 3DS - May 2, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Notable Gaming Threads and Events[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4163416][b]H1Z1 - NEW Zombie MMO from SONY -> Next live stream 29/4/14[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=72598]The-Noob[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4188715][b]What games did you play when you were little that seemingly nobody else did?[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1331828]Vent[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4197569][b]Brotherhood Game Night - GTA V - Open to Everyone! - 5/2/2014[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]\n\nInterested in having your gaming event or thread posted in here?

After a few weeks without a real snapshot, Mojang is back with a progress report. The Minecraft developer team has been working hard to improve the game's internal code, plugin API has been rewritten, and some big additions have been made as far as world generation goes. The notable changes, taken straight from Mojang's website, are as follows:\n[list]\n[color=white][*][/color]New highly customisable terrain generation! (Create new world -> “World Type: Customized”)\n[color=white][*][/color]New customisable world borders! Check out the /worldborder command.\n[color=white][*][/color]Lots of bug fixes, performance gains and code cleaninguperizing.\n[color=white][*][/color]???\n[/list]\n[i]Wait, what?[/i] What do those ambiguous question marks mean? It seems like Mojang is teasing us this time around as they usually give us a full changelog! If you'd like to see the new changes in action, create a new profile within your Minecraft launcher. Name it \"snapshots\" and be sure to check the button that enables snapshots-- this will download the snapshot automatically. Remember, before you play using an experimental update, always have a backup!\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft Realms is Now Live![/color][/b]\nMinecraft Realms, a feature which was released in Beta almost six months ago, is officially live. For those unfamiliar with Realms, it's a service offered to the public that allows anyone to purchase and host their own server hassle-free. Starting at $13 a month, Mojang allows players to purchase a Realm through plans that range from a single month to six months long. Realms can accommodate up to ten players, all of whom must be invited by the host. This new multiplayer option fulfills the needs of the parents of younger players who are unable to set up their own servers; since there's a essentially a whitelist, children can play realms with their friends without worrying about malicious players. It's also a useful feature for those who want a small server of their own but don't want to deal with the technical side of server management. According to Mojang's website, users can also play minigames that are included in the purchase of a Realms server. Unfortunately, Realms is currently only available for the desktop versions of Minecraft, as Realms for Pocket Edition has been put on hold for now. Interested in purchasing a realm for yourself? Check out Mojang's Realms page [url=https://minecraft.net/realms]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Denmark Recreated in a 1:1 Scale[/color][/b]\nGeodatastyrelsen, a Danish geodata company, has completely recreated the country of Denmark using real geographical information. This Minecraft version of Denmark is built in a 1:1 scale and includes buildings, rivers, streets, and more. Residents of Denmark can even login and find their own house! While it does have accurate depictions of all the buildings in Denmark, the map does not feature accurate below-ground interaction. The map, which is a first of its kind, is so large that it takes three servers to hold. Each of these servers only holds 70 players, so naturally it is very hard to gain access and login. It is possible, however, to [url=http://download.kortforsyningen.dk/content/danmarks-frie-geodata-i-minecraftverden]download the maps yourself[/url], although you may need a friend from Denmark to guide you through the process; the information and instructions are all in Danish.\n\n[b][color=#FFD700]Featured Server of the Week:[/color][color=white] The Beast[/color][/b]\nThe Beast is a variety server that features three game modes including Mineshock, Factions, and Prison. Owned by a member local to HF, promises of new content and fair play along with an organized structure render this server quite appealing. If you're looking to play casual minigames or survival factions, The Beast is a server you should consider. To log on, join [color=white]play.mcbeast.net[/color] or visit their website [url=http://mcbeast.net/]here[/url].\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yMU9Olr.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]First Official Release for the Missing MH370 Plane is Released[/color][/b]\nA five-page report of the missing Malaysian aeroplane has been revealed and shows some worrying results. For the first 17 minutes of when the plane went missing, no one noticed. Then when someone finally realized, a search was not carried out for another 4 hours. Many family members are of currently lost are understandably angered by this and are calling for action. Unfortunately, the search is soon to scale down with many family-shelters to close down next week. The report also suggest that a new 'real-time plane tracking' should be worked on to stop any other incidents happening in the future. \n\n[color=white][b]Massive Iceberg Six Times The Size Of Manhattan Breaks Off Antarctica:[/b][/color]\nAn Iceberg roughly six times the size of Manhattan and one of the largest now in existence has broken off of Antarctica. The name given to it, B31, is roughly 255 square miles (669 square km) and is up to a third of a mile (500 meters) thick. Icebergs this large are monitored extremely close due to all the shipping lanes in the area. Right now NASA are not concerned that it will affect much.\n\n[color=white][b]China Says More Than Half of Its Groundwater Is Polluted[/b][/color]\nNearly 60% of China's underground water is now considered polluted as China continues to battle environmental damages overall. The country's land and resource ministry found that out of roughly 203 cities, 44% had relatively poor underground water quality and that 15.7% tested very poor. The officials also stated that relatively poor water can be treated but anything below cannot due to the treatment cost and time. China is planning on building a desalinization plant to provide one-third of Beijing's tap water by 2019. The treatment center will cost roughly 7bn yuan.\n\n[b][color=white]Ukraine Reinstates Conscription[/color][/b]\nDue to the deepening crisis in Ukraine, the government has reinstated conscription to deal with deteriorating security in the country. The move which was announced in a decree and has come due to the recent pro-Russian rebellion which saw many government buildings seized, including the regional prosecutor's office in the eastern city of Donetsk. Ukraine has blamed Russia for the organization of the rebellions. Russia has also stationed over 40,000 troops on the border of Ukraine. Oleksandr Turchynov, who is the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine, has admitted on Wednesday that his forces were currently 'helpless'. The pro-Russian militia is in large numbers and is currently overrunning the police, with many officials simply 'running away'.\n\n[b][color=white]North Korea's First Luxury Ski Resort Opens[/color][/b]\nAlthough the pictures make the resort look like a ghost town, North Korea's first 'luxury' ski resort in Masikryong has finally opened! The site spans over a 1,400-hectare site with over 70 miles of slopes which are kept in pristine condition by hundreds of snow canons. Many visiting will get to stay in the luxurious hotel which features a large swimming pool and a modest bar. North Korea's own leader Kim Jong-Un visited the site in December and reported there was 'with great satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable'.\n\n[color=white][b]Families Angrily Confront Officials Over South Korea Ferry Search[/b][/color]\nIn South Korea, families from the missing children are starting to curse at the government and police officials for failing to do their job in saving the lives of any survivors left. They are calling out that the vast majority of the information given to the public at the time of the incident was indeed false or misleading. The ferry \"Sewol\" capsized on April 16th with 476 people aboard which included over 300 high school students who were on a field trip. The number of dead is at roughly 181, with 121 missing and the rest unaccounted for. The hopes of the missing and unaccounted for living this far is fairly low. At this time the authorities are unsure to why the boat sank.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ndzWS1q.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Frozen Soundtrack Tops #1 On Billboard For 11 Weeks[/b][/color]\n\"Let it Go,\" a soundtrack from Disney's hit film \"Frozen,\" currently has 11 consecutive weeks of a #1 ranking on the music Billboard. The Oscar-winning song sold over 259,000 copies (caused by Easter holidays) last week, bringing a total of 2.3 million since its release. This popular song also topped Disney's sales with our all time favorite \"Lion\" from Lion King, which held the spot for 10 weeks. See more [url=http://triblive.com/lifestyles/morelifestyles/5958824-74/says-song-frozen]here[/url]. The soundtrack is getting pretty boring hearing it time after time. Why don't people just \"let it go?\"\n\n[color=white][b]MTV Video/Music Awards Will Return to L.A.[/b][/color]\nOne of the top-viewed showcases, the annual MTV Video Music Awards will return to Los Angeles this summer. This event will happen August the 24th, the day before the Emmy Awards. It is being held at the \"Fabulous\" Forum like before and has become a destination for music lovers. The announcement was given on Wednesday live from Inglewood. I'm sure we are all glad that the MTV is finally returning to the west coast. The Forum used to host many of the world's musical talents, but later fell on hard times. There was a one million dollar makeover and MTV has more-or-less returned to its normal state now. It has already hosted acts like the Eagles or Justin Timberlake.\n\n[color=white][b]Kevin Sharp, Country Singer and Cancer Survivor, Dies at Age 43[/b][/color]\n\"He was such a gentle soul, and had such a giving heart,\" says Wayne Warner, who worked with Sharp on two albums. Kevin Sharp, who survived cancer as a teenager and became a very well-known country singer, has been proclaimed dead. His reason of death? Ongoing complications from past surgeries and digestive issues. His album, \"Measure of a Man,\" which was released in the November of 1996, hit the top 20's of country charts. Sharp has become a motivational speaker and writer, doing speeches and books on cancer. He wrote Tragedy's Gift, a book published in 2004 which talks about his fight with cancer. He was a proud speaker for the Make-A-Wish foundation. Sharp was a great man, and a great musician. May he be remembered in our hearts.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[sp]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlcIKh6sBtc[/video][/sp]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",
