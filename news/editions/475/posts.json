It was created by a collaboration of the companies Hulu, Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Viz. The app provided a legal way to read the licensed manga. The service is not free, and a fee of $4.99 a month is the cost of a subscription. Currently, the application is only available on the Apple iOS store. However, there will be an Android application available soon. The scheduled date has been set for \"the next following weeks or months.\" [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-07-03/mangamo-manga-app-plans-android-version-territorial-availability-expansion/.161422]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Tokyo One Piece Tower Attraction Closes Down on July 31[/color][/b]\r\nIn 2015, the One Piece franchise opened up a small theme park inside of the Tokyo Tower. Inside the theme park were several lifesize statues of the characters from the anime. Additionally, props from the show were also made into lifesize. You were able to see your favorite characters, but there was a shop with One Piece merchandise, as well as a food station where you could purchase food-related to the anime. Sadly, this theme park will be closing at the end of July. The reasoning of its closure has to do with the COVID-19 epidemic. Due to the theme park being indoors and the possibility that the theme park's quality will decrease, the One Piece franchise believes it is best to close it down.

There is no set date on when the movie will be released in North American theatres, but what we do know is that Funimation will be working with Aniplex of America to get the movie distributed to various theatres throughout the US.
