Google says, “it saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 scams” recently. Luckily, their AI filters are in a position to detect these scams “more than 99.9 percent of spam, phishing, and malware from reaching our users”. Such scams are another step away from the 240 million daily spam emails that users already get to COVID-19.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223800/google-malware-phishing-covid-19-coronavirus-scams] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Ear Pads[/color][/b]\r\nAirPods dominated the market for true wireless earphones when they were first launched. Apple is now going to build on this line of products and release a new product, “modular-style over-the-ear” wireless headphones sometime in the future. Ear pads, as they are called, will give the user the option to remove the padding on the headphones so that they can be personalized. Two models will be available, one a luxury version with leather-style fabrics, and the other model will be much lighter and fitness-oriented. There is no other detail on the ear pads as of now.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-is-reportedly-working-on-customizable-headphones/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Clearview AI Exposed[/color][/b]\r\nClearview AI source code has been revealed to the public, sort of. Clearview AI was a hidden startup that received the attention of their users back in January. It allows law enforcement users to take a photo of someone and test it against 3 billion photos, which will then tell the user who that person is. All this data was scrapped from public social media profiles. There's been a slip up with one of their servers that stores data. The misconfigured server exposed all its internal files, apps, and source code for the apps. CSO, Mossab Hussein, who works at SpiderSilk, a Dubai-based cybersecurity company, has found a repository that contains all these files that have been revealed. The repository was private, although it allowed anyone with a password to access the files. It was soon discovered that the repository had been misconfigured, so anybody could sign up as a new user so gain access to the repository. Hussein declined a bounty offer from Clearview AI, because he would not have been able to share this double whammy if he accepted it.[i][size=x-small][url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/clearview-source-code-lapse/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4570721][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/animenews-megane.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Voice Actors Keiji Fujiwara (55) and Hiroshi Masuoka (83) Pass Away Due to Cancer[/color][/b]\r\nAt the age of 55, the voice actor, Fujiwara Keiji, sadly passed away due to cancer on April 12. Keiji was known for various roles not only in anime but in video games too. Some notable characters that Keiji voiced were Maes Hughes from Fullmetal Alchemist, Reno from Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, and ACDC from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In 2016, Keiji underwent surgery. After the surgery, he took a break for a year and slowly returned to the world of voice acting in 2017. A wake was held for him for family and friends.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the voice actor for Masuo Fuguta in Sazae-san and Jam Ojisan in Anpanman, Hiroshi Masuoka, has passed away recently too. Sadly, no further information has been released.

Vanguard Gaiden if\" was supposed to air this spring 2020 season starting Saturday the 11 of April, but sadly had to be delayed once again. The good news is that the delay is only two weeks and the new series in the franchise will be able to premiere on April 25. Hopefully, the epidemic settles down more and the show is not delayed any further. Of course, everyone's health is more important though! Additionally, the latest film in the Evangelion series, \"Evangelion: 3.0+1.0\" will also have to delay its viewing. The movie was supposed to air in Japan on June 27 and there is no current date in which the film has been rescheduled for.

The project will eventually turn into a live-action movie; however, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the movie has been delayed. On the bright side, the VFX videos will be released every Tuesday and a total of six episodes will be aired. The project will star three members from the Japanese idol group, Nogizaka46. The three members chosen were Mizuki Yamashita as Tsubame Mizusaki, Asuka Saitō as Midori Asakusa, and Minami Umezawa as Sayaka Kanamori. The anime adaption of Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! is based on the manga. In the anime/manga, the three band together to form the Video Research Club. Within the VRC, they use their skills in marketing, drawing/animating, and sound production to create outstanding animated videos. The VFX videos that have been released showcase behind the scenes look of what the movie will look like.

There is no set date on when it will be released, but if all things run smoothly, then the game should be released later this year. The game will be available in the Americas, Europe, as well as Japan. Those who purchase Jump Force Deluxe Edition will have the chance to unlock the first DLC pack, which allows you to obtain new characters. Additionally, the Deluxe Edition will provide you with a new game mode that is not in the first edition of Jump Force, the offline 3-vs.-3 mode. The characters unlocked from the first DLC pass will include:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]All Might + Katsuki Bakugo - My Hero Academia\r\n[*]Majin Buu - Dragon Ball Z\r\n[*]Seto Kaiba - Yu-Gi-Oh!\r\n[*]Biscuit Krueger - Hunter x Hunter\r\n[*]Madara Uchiha - Naruto\r\n[*]Toshiro Hitsugaya + Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez - Bleach\r\n[*]Trafalgar Law, Kane and Galena - One Piece\r\n[/list]\r\n([url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-04-16/jump-force-game-gets-switch-version-dlc-character-shoto-todoroki/.158663]Source for DLC Characters[/url])\r\n\r\nFurthermore, players can also expect a new DLC pack which will contain additional characters. The only confirmed character is Shoto Todoroki from My Hero Academia, but there will be one new character for Hunter x Hunter, Yū Yū Hakusho, Bleach, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
