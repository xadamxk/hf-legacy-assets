To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://goo.gl/pxojJ]here[/url]. \n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2Ejce.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Official Group Illuminati's First Ever Recruitment[/color][/b]\nOfficial marketing group \"Illuminati\" lead by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][b]Vіnnie[/b][/url] has opened recruitment for the first time in the history of the group. The group has always remained invite-only throughout the group's long existence. The official reasoning behind the group is \"The illuminati is based on marketing, monetizing, selling, buying, trading, currency exchanging, free services & giveaways. In addition to the supposed shadowy and secret organization we are just overall into helping those who desire the passion of making money online & offline.\" If you think you may be interested in joining a marketing based group, applications are open at the time of this post, and may be located and read here: [url]http://bit.ly/ZthipE[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Important Action Being Taken[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has been taking action lately and cracking down on the post/delete method which people use to bum.p their threads to the top of the forum. An individual would post on their thread, and then delete the post. They would repeat this process to get more attention or sales. If you're thinking about using this, think again. Moderators and other staff members have tools to see who has done this.\n\n[color=white][b]Hack Forums Average Daily Posts[/b][/color]\nHack Forums after many years has always had a lot of daily posts. Well finally, the record has been broken. The statistics page is now showing that the average daily posts on HackForums overall is now 10,000. This is a great milestone, keep on posting. If you would like to view the statistics page, feel free to do so here: http://hackforums.net/stats.php\n\n[b][color=white]New Rule in Free Services and Giveaways[/color][/b]\nA new rule has been implemented in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=186][b]Free Services and Giveaway[/b][/url] section. The new rule suggests that there is to be no more contests or drawings in the section. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] said, \"This section is for freebies and giveaways. If you have a limited amount of something to give away then you must make that limit known in your first post and what requirements you have to earn it. However those requirements cannot mimic a contest or drawings.\" For contests and drawings use the forum located here: http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=155\n\n[color=white][b]Thread Tweeting Implemented[/b][/color]\nThread tweeting has finally been implemented. The tweet button is navigated at the top right of Hack Forums, and you must be on a thread for this button to be visible. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] said, \"I'm experimenting with a Tweet button on Showthread pages. On the upper right hand corner you can tweet the page you're on. This is just an experiment for now. I might remove this within minutes, hours or days. I'll see how it goes.\" By the looks of it, this button will be sticking around, for now anyway.

Good day, ladies & gentlemen. For the 139th edition of the Hack Forums news, I am joined by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1683082]MAN0FWAR[/url]! Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] Hi and thank you for inviting me to take part. I would like to give a shoutout to Sultan and CarrotMilk, they have helped me so much and I continue to appreciate their continued support.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the shoutout, haha. So, what was it that originally brought you to HF? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] Originally I came by HF via Google search as I was searching for a FIFA 11 / 12 Ultimate Team Hack for the PC, this was called an \"AutoBuyer\" I then stayed at HF because I found the information on the site to be interesting and valuable to my learning of my day to day job.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I see you're a relatively new user; what do you think of the HF community thus far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] I find the community to be very diverse and all in all a great bunch of guys. Ofc as with any community there are the odd few that try to go against the grain but the admins here at HF do a great job.\nI think the forums offer knowledge in many different areas and this is what I like about it, it's not all about hacking but can be normal day to day stuff too.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] And what is it right now that's your main interest and keeping you here at the forums? What made you decide to upgrade to l33t?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] My current main interests right now would be my new long term project, creating my very own \"booter\" and to make it as powerful as I possible can whilst keeping within budget.\n\nThe reasons I decided to upgrade to \"leet\" were:\n\n1. I feel that those individuals who are willing to invest in the community are the type of people that help make the community what it is, I probably did not explain that correctly just now but I hope you get my meaning. \n\n2. I also needed to post in the Premium Sellers forum and to do so you need a +rep rating and as a new member not knowing anyone at first I was unable to do so. Upgrading to \"leet\" instantly resolves this issue.\n\nI am really looking forward to building my profile and my overall goal here is to create a trustworthy product / service which people can rely on and whilst doing this try to get my account upgraded to \"Uber\" as I feel doing this would generate allot of trust.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Ahh, I see, I see. So you're hoping to make quite a reasonable income from HF? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] Not really an income just enough to be able to grow the project as long as my costs are covered that's the main focus. Anything else after that is a bonus and I will use it to make the booter better by investing more into it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I see. What was it that made you want to start a booter?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] I was inspired by the HFEmpire Booter and also the previous one I was using which is called Quantum Booter. I also wanted to make a booter so I would have control over how many users were on it so it gave great power output at all times.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] What do you think it is about booters that allows them to dominate the HF marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] I think the biggest appeal is towards the younger generation who play on xbox and pc, for example FIFA , BlackOps, Minecraft etc.It also appeals to those who want to simply see how secure there dedicated servers / networks are in terms of attacks.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for the interview. Any last words before I depart? <3\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=][color=white][b]MAN0FWAR:[/b][/color][/url] Not reeally but if you need one: \"The purpose of all war is peace\" \n\nROCK ON !!\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612]Auron[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] G'day all! Today, for the 139th edition of the Hack Forums news, we are joined by the one and only [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612]Auron[/url]! (lame name, btw) Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] Numb, Dr. Doxum, TH, Eminent, RDCA and all the other dudes in The Alliance. (even the ones that never post in the SF)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] And me, of course! Right? D:\nSo, dearest Auron, on that wondrous day that was the 7th of July, 2011, what was it that brought you to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] My friend Numb and I were looking for OG gamertags and after asking a bunch of people we were brought to this site. The tag marketplace was 10x better than it was then compared to now. You could literally sell a pile of shit (as in a horrible gamertag) and it could go for like 150 dollars in today's market.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Meh, personally, I've never been into having an \"awesome\" tag; be it for PSN, XBL or Skype etc. Reason being, I tend to have an account for a while, build up a friends list and whatever else- it just feels annoying having to start all over again. Know what I mean? 😝\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] You could just change your gamertag to the OG but then you would risk all the little shithead kids that use turbo controllers that sit on their asses all day waiting for you to change your tag so then they could claim it for themselves. I wasn't aware kids get erections off of original gamertags until I familiarized myself with the gamertag scene.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Tell me- what does \"Auron\" mean? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] Auron is a bad ass character from Final Fantasy 10. A game that I was never able to complete due to getting stuck on this one boss that was a hybrid between a scorpion and a penis. I've had numerous names prior to it. Some of my most known alias' were: Slade. (first name), Anarchy (tried to bribe this dude to take it back but he resisted), Pyro, Phobix, and recently Phobitch and Phagbix. Mind you, the last two were created by yourself, RDCA, Anal OG, and AlbinoShadow.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awwhh shucks, you 😊 Such a cutie! What sections are you most active in nowadays, then? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] I really don't post that much anymore. If I ever feel like having a decent read about people wanting to commit suicide and smoking weed I go to the lounge. And when I feel like shitting on kids for their stupidity for creating a \"Rate my shitty gamertag\" thread I go to the Xbox 360 section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Pfft, that's not completely true. Don't be so negative, my friend :D\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] It may not be as bad as I make it out to be but honestly people posting their suicide notes on HF are incredibly stupid. Posting some 300 word bullshit on why someone shouldn't commit suicide is supposed to make a difference? Especially since half of them are most likely just trolls.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Well, you're the biggest troll, baby <3\n\nRegardless of the state of parts of the community, it's undeniable that there is a wealth of information to be shared here. What do you think you have learnt most from Hack Forums? Do you feel as if you've given back to the community just as much as you've taken? If so, how?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] I think I've learned that there are a lot of dicksuckers and fake people on the internet. If you're talking about actual knowledge wise, then I am proud to say I have learned nothing. Personally, I have made a load of tutorials and informational threads relating mainly towards gaming and gamertags, so I believe I have given back enough.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I call bullshit. Whether you think you have or not, being so \"active\" on a forum- there's always a takeaway. It may be as simple as improving one's linguistic skills, or to the extent of providing life skills or general knowledge. Even when to spot \"bullshit\". SEE WOT I DID DER.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] Too be technical, I have learned much more on gamertags than I previously did. Like I said though, there isn't anything or at least anything worth mentioning that I've learned. No coding, marketing, or any of that. I was a reviewer too and even after reading loads of e-books about money-making I feel as if nothing passed me by.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Maybe you just have to look harder :) Or immerse yourself in the community a little more. Anyway, some personal stuff. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do in the future? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] I am seeking a career within video editing. I need fresh up on all my skills though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Ahh, I see. Anyway, dearest Auron, it's been a pleasure chatting. Any final words to conclude the interview? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878612][color=white][b]Auron:[/b][/color][/url] Somebody please buy this goddamn aim: http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3398401\n[/spoiler]",

A bunch of exciting new content was added to Minecraft this week, such as a new launcher and even horses. Yep, [i]horses[/i]. It's been a while since a neutral mob that actually serves a shadow of a purpose was added to the game, and horses are no disappointment. Based on horses from the popular Mo'Creatures mod, our new horse mob is tamable, ridable, and even abusable; implemented with the new horse are saddles, horse armor and leashes used to ride and control your furry friends. Saddles, obviously, are used to ride horses. Armor is used to delay the surely inevitable death of a horse and leashes are used to tie 'em up; in fact, leashes can even tie certain other mobs up. It hasn't been announced how horses will be obtained in survival mode, however I've played with the snapshot myself to figure out the new mechanics and so far horses seem like the coolest neutral mob yet. They can be tamed simply by being mounted a few times; once that's accomplished, horses can be equipped with saddles and even shiny new armor. Donkeys were also added to the game, which spawn less commonly than horses but can hold (currently inaccessible) chests on their back. Horses will drastically change PVP, as swords and bows can be freely used while riding one. Being fast creatures, horses can provide a safe and quick escape; a new jumping mechanic was even introduced specifically for horses, who can clear much larger gaps than we can. A few other new features were also introduced in this snapshot, such as carpet (thin blocks that act like snow but look like wool), hay bales (to decorate your horse's crib) and a new indev launcher which allows for easy version changing. Additionally, Minecraft will now be built for Java 6.

The Razer CEO explained that the company could legally cancel all the orders placed using the code, however they won't due to their consumer-first policy. \"While we have the option of cancelling the orders legally, we’ve always had a customer-comes-first policy at Razer and in respect of this incident, we have decided to honor the orders that were placed using the unauthorized code by Razer fans buying single products for their own use,\" Tan wrote. Razer is expected to see high amounts of losses and it could possibly take months to ship ordered products. \"Our focus is on doing the right thing for our fans, the gamers and the community, not for resellers or users to profit from this,\" Tan said. \"That’s not gaming, that’s not our deal.\" Users on Reddit had a change of heart, when many announced that they were going to cancel their personal orders and respect Razer with their decisions. \"We appreciate everyone’s patience, and we thank all of our customers for their support. Game on,\" \n\n[color=white][b]Ouya - 10,000 Developers[/b][/color]\nHead of Developer Relations, Kellee Santiago announced that Ouya now has 10,000 developers working on games and applications for the console. Developers range from small start-ups to big names such as Double Fine and Square Enix. At the end of February,  8,000 developers were signed on. \"It's really awesome, especially at this early stage of the console still being in the preview period,\" Santiago said. \"Critics have their job,\" she said. \"But what I can say is Ouya is a small company and we're very nimble and what's been encouraging about the criticism and the feedback so far is that it's all stuff we're aware of and we're working on. It's great to hear it because we are still in this preview period and we continue to iterate and improve upon the console in a way that no other company can. For our gamers and developers that creates a very supportive ecosystem for them.\" The Ouya launches on June 4 through retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, GAME, GameStop, and Target, as well as through the Ouya online store.\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox 360 Hits 77 Million Sold[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft announced that the Xbox 360 has been sold more than 77 million times. 1.3 million consoles were sold in the last three months to reach the 77 million total since the console launched back in November 2005. Along with this massive number, they said that there are now over 46 million Xbox LIVE members across the globe. The bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off as people increasingly choose Microsoft services including Office 365, Windows Azure, Xbox Live, and Skype,\" Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in a statement. \"While there is still work to do, we are optimistic that the bets we've made on Windows devices position us well for the long-term.\" Sources say that the next-generation Xbox console will be announced in the next few months.\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Xbox 360 Games[/b][/color]\n[b]Apr 16, 2013[/b] - Injustice: Gods Among Us\n[b]Apr 16, 2013[/b] - Painkiller: Hell & Damnation\n[b]Apr 23, 2013[/b] - Dead Island: Riptide\n[b]Apr 23, 2013[/b] - Star Trek\n[b]May 14, 2013[/b] - Metro: Last Light\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Fast & Furious: Showdown\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Resident Evil: Revelations\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - Fuse\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - GRID 2\n[b]Jun 04, 2013[/b] - Remember Me\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThis week's video is from DJ Keemstar... also known as KillerKeemstar which is his new troll persona. If you didn't know already, Keemstar recently got back into trolling on Xbox LIVE. So, here is Sparkles, the gay rapper. \n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpf6XunDIjs[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2Ejj2.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Margret Thatcher[/b][/color]\nSeveral days ago on the 17th of April, the late Margret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has been buried in a public funeral in Saint Paul’s Cathedral.  Many people lined the streets to see Ms Thatcher’s coffin pass, with a procession being led by Queen Elizabeth the 2nd at its head.\nAlthough Ms. Thatcher’s political endeavors and accomplishments made her unliked by some, with people turning their backs on the coffin as it passed them in the street, she was still one of the most notable Prime Ministers that Britain had ever had, as well as being the first female Prime Minister.\nWith a funeral with over 2000 defense force personnel and a total cost of over £10 million, there is much dispute whether the 87-year old former Prime Minister’s funeral was worth such an exorbitant price.\n[color=white][b]\nBoston Bombings[/b][/color]\nOn the morning of April 15th during the annual Boston Marathon, two improvised Explosive Devices went off at the finish line of the event, leaving three people dead and over 180 wounded. This was originally thought to be the world of religious extremists and an obvious act of terrorism, yet with no known motive or party coming forward to take responsibility, the initial few hours were a mystery.\nThe FBI examined hundreds of hours of video footage and thousands of still images to break down what happened and who placed the explosives and, on the 18th of April two brothers:[list]\n[*] Tamerlan Tsarnaev\n[*] Dzhokhar Tsarnaev [/list]\nwere identified and their information were spread around the country in a nationwide manhunt. The next day, after having car-jacked and stolen from a civilian, Tamerlan was captured by the police and taken to hospital after a fire-fight ended with him receiving multiple gunshot wounds to his body, where he then died.\nThat night, the police were notified of Dzhokhar hiding underneath a boat-cover and a careful and precise extraction was undertaken so that he was taken alive, which was successful.\n\n[color=white][b]New Zealand Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage[/b][/color]\nNew Zealand has become the 13th nation in the world which has officially recognized and legalized the ability for two people of the same gender to be married, after a recent vote ended 77 for, 44 against the proposition.\nThe bill has received a substantial amount of positive feedback from the general public and LGBT supporters themselves, with the sponsor of the bill stating that she is\n[i]\"very proud to be a member of a Parliament that has voted overwhelmingly to give New Zealanders, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender, the right to marry.\"[/i]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2EjjA.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Android[/b][/color]\nAs all Android lovers would know, the Galaxy S4 will be the next addition to the Galaxy family before this summer. Earlier this week Verizon launched the official [url=http://www.verizonwireless.com/wcms/consumer/devices/samsung-galaxy-s4.html]Samsung Galaxy S4 Page[/url] on their site. The site does not give confirmed details about the next smartphone, but it allows users to enter their email and subscribe to further official announcements and  information that will release about the smartphone. Earlier this week Verizon tweeted that the S4 would come packing on a 4G LTE network some time this May. While being one of the largest carriers in the US, Verizon will be the first to stock the phone on its store's shelves soon following Sprint and T-Mobile. AT&T has said that the S4 will be shipped in late April, just days after other carriers.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nThis April marks the 27th consecutive month that the Xbox 360 has made a land slide in the console gaming industry. On April 18th, the company announced that more Xboxes were sold in March than Play Station 3s and Wii Us combined, with a whopping total of 261,000 consoles sold. On April 20th, Microsoft announced the overall total profit for Xboxes since release, was over 400 million US dollars. Microsoft seems to be taking the lead in console gaming, with the next model of Xbox just around the corner.\n\n[color=white][b]HTC[/b][/color]\nWith the release of the S4, HTC seems to be one step ahead. The HTC One was released on April 19th leaving customers in lines at both AT&T and Sprint stores. With the cost of the smartphone being close to that of it's competitors, selling for 200 US dollars for a 2 year contract and 32 gigabyte model. If you are tied to a contract with T-mobile, do not fret; the HTC One will release on April 24th for all T-Mobile stores. If you are a user with more media than others, a 64 gigabyte model will release in just weeks.\n\n[color=white][b]Reddit[/b][/color]\nIt seems that a number of popular social sites and blogs have been the victim of several DDOS attacks. This week, Reddit was pounced with a fairly large Denial of Service attack that left users offline for nearly two hours. The site had come back online after 7AM Eastern time, with thousands of users talking about the Boston Bombing and supposed rumors behind it. Even after the staff of Reddit redirected the attack, the site was still facing difficulties for several hours after the site came back up. Reddit apologized for the inconvenience via Twitter, and gave its dues to the victims of the Boston bombing incident.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2EjjW.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Snoop Lion's 420 Party Shut Down[/b][/color]\nSnoop Lion's 420 party was reportedly shut down by police, before the rapper had actually arrived. It had been planned at Lion's mansion in Hollywood Hills to mark \"Cannabis day\", and began at 11:00am on Saturday. Unfortunately, his neighbors began to complain about the loud noise and the parking situation and this led to the party's end. The party was set to last throughout the night. When Saturday came, Snoop tweeted to his followers to mark the occasion. \"Bout to be #Snoop420. Who's celebratin' wit me (sic) The happy holidays\" the tweet wrote. Last year, Snoop Lion had told the Hollywood Reporter that he hoped for Cannabis to be legalized in the US, or more specifically California. \"There would be fewer high-speed chases, fewer robberies, less crime,\" he commented. \"Go to Amsterdam or the Netherlands, where it is legal, and you see that the crime rate is nonexistent, the murder rate is probably under 10 percent, people learn to get along! There are people riding on bicycles being happy and it's because of the environment that's provided by the legalization of marijuana.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Willie Nelson to Dedicate 80th Birthday Gig to Texas Blast Victims[/b][/color]\nWillie Nelson had scheduled a show on April 28th to celebrate his 80th birthday which is coming up on April 30th. However, the celebration took a back-seat after an explosion in Texas ripped through a fertilizer plant, killing many, just five miles where he grew up. Willie has announced that any money made from the gig will be donated to the West Volunteer Fire Department who fought the blaze and who lost five of their volunteer crew in the explosion. Willie issued a statement on the event: \"West is just a few miles from my hometown of Abbott. I was born and raised here and it was my backyard growing up. This is my community. These friends and neighbors have always been and are still a part of my life. My heart is praying for the community that we call home.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Gomez and Bieber Can't Stay Apart[/b][/color]\n19 year old Justin Bieber and 20 year old Selena seem to be unable to stay apart from each other, even after their split from each other in December after a whole two years of dating. Recently, Selena flew all the way to Norway on Thursday to support Justin while he was performing at a concert in Oslo to his Scandinavian \"Beliebers\". It has been noticed by many now that they just can't keep away from each other, despite no longer being one unit. \"They have a crazy connection,\" a source commented. \"They just can't seem to break their connection. It can be intense.\" Since their break up, many have complained that Justin Bieber's attitude and behavior has gone downhill, after incidents such as his two hour late concert and his insensitive remarks about Anne Frank. On top of this, he has apparently been caught smoking weed and speeding on multiple occasions in his car. Many are eager for the two to get back together, including Justin's mum after seeing what a good influence Selena has been on his son. \"Pattie [Justin's mother] has been pushing hard for Justin to get back with Selena. However, Selena doesn't want to associate with the crowd Justin's been hanging out with lately as she thinks they're not to be trusted,\" a source recently explained.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9uSyICrtow[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2Ejkh.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI'd like to just appreciate this moment right here. To think about the amount of work and effort that has gone into what you're seeing right now. Not the work and effort put in by the News team, but rather by the advancement of the technological age and everyone involved. Just think about the amount of time it took to build what the internet is today. Lifetimes upon lifetimes upon lifetimes have been written on these machines, all to be transferred via cable and data for endless distances and stored for unfathomable time. Think... just think about the world we live in today. It's just bewildering.",

Since Legion is all about Hacking, Illuminati is \nabout Monetizing and Respawn is about gaming, when you have a group \nthat is about all things you are bound to get low quality members over \nthrowing the group to make it more LQ than it really is.
