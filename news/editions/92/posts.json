This is due to quite a few members using their dynamic IP service to create multiple accounts and evade bans. He also mentioned that all of their IP's are blocked as well.

Based on the group description found [url=http://hackforums.net/showgroups.php]here[/url], it seems to resemble The Wraith in the sense that they partake in debates, and of course, because they are very secretive.

In addition to that, the group was removed and all members that joined haven't been refunded for their entrance fee.

To obtain the award members have to purchase it for $100 and accept the fact that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] will most likely humiliate you in the award's description.

Thanks for joining us in this interview, Chief. First of all, I'd like to say happy birthday to you on behalf of the News Team! Before we start, would you like to make any shout-outs?[/color]\r\n[color=#00BFFF][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#00BFFF]Chief.[/url][/color]:[/b] [color=#00BFFF]Thanks for having me bro. I'll drop a shout-out to Hexicidal and Purple Haze.[/color][/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]Chocothunda[/url]:[/b] Absolutely welcome, I'm sure they will appreciate the shout-out. With the vague sections of HackForums, nearly anyone can join and find a section suited for them. How did you personally find out about HackForums, and why did you join?[/color]\r\n[color=#00BFFF][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#00BFFF]Chief.[/url][/color]:[/b] [color=#00BFFF]I wanted to learn how to hack AIMs and simple iPod games so i did some googling and found HF. I looked around and enjoyed the site. I believe I upgraded myself within my first week.[/color][/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]Chocothunda[/url]:[/b] Well you obviously made a great choice. What do you think is the most important thing you've learned from HackForums?[/color]\r\n[color=#00BFFF][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#00BFFF]Chief.[/url][/color]:[/b] [color=#00BFFF]I've learned quite a bit of coding in various areas. HTML, VB, CSS. I'm currently trying to get into php and learn more VB. I'm most experienced in HTML and websites.[/color][/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]Chocothunda[/url]:[/b] Glad to see you've succeeded in these areas.  I'm sure you'll master the others quickly as well.  What would you say is your biggest accomplishment at HF?[/color]\r\n[color=#00BFFF][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#00BFFF]Chief.[/url][/color]:[/b] [color=#00BFFF]I would probably say coming back from a dead account. That was a pretty boring time. I was addicted to HF( lol ) at that time and it just wasn't there. I lost some of my skills because I mostly focused on helping people on HF. I've since tried to not be as harse with users but at times i am.[/color][/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]Chocothunda[/url]:[/b] That's an impressive feat.  Last but not least, do you have any particular section on HF you prefer to be in, any why?[/color]\r\n[color=#00BFFF][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#00BFFF]Chief.[/url][/color]:[/b] [color=#00BFFF]I would say the Lounge but it's not as fun anymore. Most of the old trolls are long gone and the new ones are just plain stupid. I enjoy the Visual basic section and Group Subforums.I also like to check the R.A.T section and help out people.[/color][/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]Chocothunda[/url]:[/b] You sound like you have your life, passions, and priorities, right where you want it, and I'm sure it will further your success inevitably. I'd like to thank you for joining me in this interview and I've had a great time. Before we go, do you have any last words for the readers?[/color]\r\n[color=#00BFFF][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=458073][color=#00BFFF]Chief.[/url][/color]:[/b] [color=#00BFFF]Thanks for having me again man. Just remember to not troll to hard. :D Later Boys.[/color][/color]\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113]Dan.[/url][/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] I've ran into a very beloved member of our community; this weeks interviewee had definitely earned this opportunity-- how's everything going Dan?[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]I'm doing great Waleed. Summer is coming up, school is almost over. How could it not be going good?[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] That's great to hear, surely all of us here on Hack Forums can't wait for summer break. Would you like to give your closest HF friends a shout out; I bet they'd appreciate seeing their names featured in our next edition of HF News.[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]I would love too. Here are some people that I have grown a good friendship with and love to hang out with them. Chief., iNviZ, ABlackFedora, Suryap, Scar_, H3x3N. There are many more, these are just what I thought of off the top of my head.[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] You've made quite a large circle of friends. You're becoming relatively well-known around the forum and you constantly strive to give back to the community. What would you say is your greatest accomplishment thus far?[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]For me, buying my group was a great accomplishment. I can't wait to start inviting members and get the group active.[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] Serenity is definitely a group needed in the forum, it'll teach the members the importance of brotherhood and unity. Would you mind sharing with our readers what your new group's (Serenity) motive and intentions are? [/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]I would like to share that. This will be the first time I have publicly said this, so here we go. Serenity will not only focus on unity and participating in a group, but we will host large discussions and debates. It could be on any topic, members of the group will be required to post their own threads, and members will have to participate by posting their opinions and points. I have high hopes for the group and I think it will succeed.[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] This definitely reminds me of my days in The Wraith. Were you hoping to revive what The Wraith brought to the forum in terms of conversing and expressing different views?[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]I have been told that. I was never personally in The Wraith. From what you have said, yes, that is what I want my group to be about. I would like to also post outside of the subforum in the name of the group also, so we can get HF's opinions as a whole and not just who is inside the group. This will also be a great way to recruit members.[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] There is a new group known as Logic, who carry the same aim regarding debating and discussing; Logic also plans on going official very soon. Do you think this group will intervene with Serenity's objective?[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]They do have a similar objective, but I feel we are going to run it differently. As I said before, I want the members to be like a family. Going off topic in the sub-forum won't bother me. Anyone who has been in a group here before will know that the description of the group and what goes on in the sub-forum can be vastly different. Discussion and debates will be our main goal, but will not be limited to that. Answering your question, I don't feel they will be viewed as one in the same.[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] I understand Serenity is an invite only group, is this a set rule or are you concidering the idea of applications-- also, you're currently the only member undertaking the leadership role; do you plan on promoting people to the position?[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]For the immediate future, I will be the only one recruiting members. I have no plans of having a leader add members without my permission. I want to make sure we withhold a level of quality to the users in the group. Take that lightly though, anything could happen once the group becomes active and we have a decent member base. We will just have to see.[/color]\r\n\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=769614]Waleed:[/url][/b] Thanks for taking the time out of your day to partake in this interview, it's greatly appreciated by the news team. I'd also like to thank you on behalf of our readers for sharing insider information about your new group. Do you have any last words for our readers?[/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][color=#87CEFA][b]Dan.:[/b][/url][/color] [color=#87CEFA]I appreciate you having me. To the readers, be on the look out for Serenity. We will be adding members in just a few days. Also, as requested, H3x3N is the best. Thanks again. :)[/color][/spoiler]",

Lai, now 53, fled to Canada in 1999 and successfully avoided extradition for twelve years. His argument being that if he was, he would face torture and execution back in China. He was accused of bribing officials and trafficking things such as cars and oil, described as ‘one of China’s biggest political scandals’. After Beijing promised that he would not be executed, Canadian authorities deported him back in 2011.\n\n[color=white][b]US ‘Baby Boomers’ are being Advised to take a Blood Test[/b][/color]\nThe US Centers for Disease Control have started a campaign that they believe could save more than 120,000 lives. It has been said those born between 1945 and 1965 are the most probable to be infected with Hepatitis C. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of infections were contracted during each year in the ‘70s and ‘80s, the time when the ‘baby boomers’ would have been young in adulthood. \n\nHepatitis C was first identified in 1989, and many infections came from before screening began in 1992. As it was not identified at the time, it was mainly transmitted through blood donations. The reason the CDC are giving advice is because statistics show that 2 million out of the 3.2 million Americans which are known to be infected, are ‘baby boomers’.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Facebook[/color][/b]\nFacebook launched their IPO today. They opened up at 38 dollars a share. Some people are skeptical about buying it because they think it will fail, however, current shareholders are said to be making millions from Facebook's IPO. Some analysts are saying that you should wait to get in to Facebook, to see what would happen in the long run. \n\n[b][color=white]iPhone 5[/color][/b]\nMore rumors are coming out about the iPhone 5. There is currently a huge rumor about the screen size. It's said to be anywhere from 4-4.3 inches. The iPhone currently has a 3.5 inch screen which isn't bad, but people want a larger one, for more HD. Another rumor is that Steve Jobs himself worked on the newly redesigned iPhone. Some are saying that he carved it by hand. This could be an iffy rumor because of the 4S release, which was expected to be the game changer for iPhone. \n\n[color=white][b]Iran vs Google[/b][/color]\nIran? Yes, Iran. Iran is suing Google because of Google Maps. Google Maps is one of the most detailed online maps out there right now, yet Iran is suing Google Maps because they did not label a huge body of water known to most as \"The Persian Gulf.\" In case you didn't know, Iran used to be called Persia. \n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbjo5C8ZAaCfSc.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]T.I. Sets a Date for [i]'Trouble Man'[/i][/b][/color]\nT.I. plans to release his eighth album, Trouble Man, on September 4th of this year. He revealed the news at an interview with Hot 97's Angie Martinez on May 15th. He also debuted a new single from the album, \"Like That.\" Previous singles include \"Hear Ye, Hear Ye\" and \"I'm Flexin,'\" featuring Big K.R.I.T. Since completing his time in federal prison last September, T.I. has been busy on several occasions. Lately he has signed an upcoming rapper Iggy Azalea, and also produced B.o.B's sophomore album, Strange Clouds, as well as released his mixtape \"Fuck Da City Up\" in January. While his reality show T.I. & Tiny Family Hustle earned him a second season, he will be busy building his career as an actor with upcoming roles. \n\n[color=white][b]Big Sean is Principal for a Day at Michigan School[/b][/color]\nBig Sean gave an appearance for the students at Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan when he visited and served as the principal for the day. He appeared at the school on Monday, May 14th as the grand prize for raising its attendance ratings by 9%. Sean went from classroom to classroom visiting students and explaining to them the importance of staying in school. He also attended Class Technical High School, where he graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Sean was offered a scholarship to Michigan State University.\n\n[color=white][b]Lady Gaga Forced to Cancel Concert in Indonesia[/b][/color]\nIndonesia rolled up the mat on Lady Gaga's concert. Gaga's show was sold out, but legislators got in the middle and figured out a way to shut down the concert before she could even touch the country's ground. A group of religious conservatives came together under the operation of protecting the youth's from corruption to raise concerns about Gaga's performance. A few threatened physical violence, and officers warned that they wouldn't be able to give adequate security for Gaga's threats of attack. Later, they were denied the permission needed for her show. Many people believe this will not be the first nor last Gaga has trouble with her reputation. After the release of her second album 'Born This Way,' the sexually explicit star who spreads\nhomosexuality was banned in Lebanon after they deemed her content \"offensive to Christianity.\" Her music videos also faced a ban in the U.K., along with sales of her upcoming tour dates in South Korea restricting concert goers to 18 and over, because conservatives were not comfortable with teens attending her show.\n\n[color=white][b]Bobby Brown Talks New Album[/b][/color]\nSince the death of his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, reports of Bobby's estranged relationship with his daughter, Bobbi Kristina, and a recent arrest shows he could use some treatment. Brown is planning to get his life back on track this year. He's starting with the revival of his music career. He's planning to release his first album in 14 years called, 'Masterpiece' this summer. He also went on the [i]Today Show[/i] with Matt Lauer, so as to set some things straight about speculation of his turbulent marriage with Whitney Houston. Brown said that he never did any hardcore drugs before he met Whitney. He still claims that he's drug free, but Brown was charged with a DUI this past March for drugs. Later, he made a deal to settle this issue with the LAPD. Despite the problems he's been having, the singer remains dedicated to his future career. The album he's releasing isn't the only thing on Brown's plate. He's also marrying his fiancee, Alicia Etheridge, during the summer, at Honolulu, Hawaii. The wedding's date is set for June 15th, and they will be flying out some of his friends and family to witness the ceremony. There is still no word on whether or not his daughter, Bobbie Kristina, will attend the event.\n\n[color=white][b]Jay-Z Opts for Quality Time With Blue Ivy Over Studio Time[/b][/color]\nAlthough Jay-Z will be staying in the spotlight with his upcoming tour in Europe, he says he doesn't have any plans to release music anytime soon. The rap artist also stated that he's taking some time off from the recording studio to help raise his daughter, Blue Ivy Carter. Jay was in Philadelphia on May 14 for the announcement he made in the America festival. The two-day event will feature performances by 28 different artists from all genres, hand picked by Jay-Z himself. The lineup will not be announced until Monday, he said 70% of the artists had already been confirmed.

I went through and fixed what grammatical errors I found, but I underestimated how long it would take me. I expected to have it out over an hour ago. I plan on releasing it earlier on next week, as I now know how long it will take and will set out a block of time earlier in the day. Enjoy!",

There \nreally is too much to keep up with, and find the interesting stuff going on around \nHF, and the News is great to show you the best bits. Without the HF news, there \nwouldn't be such a bond around HackForums, where everyone knew what was the \nlatest hot topic, and who was the next scammer to be banned. It's also interesting \nto \"flip\" through the Comics and the Non-HF related News, which I wouldn't usually \nfind. The Interviews introduce me to a lot of great new members, and see opinions \nabout several things, I hope to be in one one day. The webshow can be improved, \nbut it really spices up the text with an actual voice telling you about an online forum. \nI sometimes read the news just for that. There is always the occasional error to \nbitch about, but overall HF News cannot be replaced. \"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1134703][i]-bobjon[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I believe that the HF News team are doing an amazing job, and \nserving a much needed demand in the community. Without this section, a lot of \nmembers would be majorly behind on the current happenings, obviously. Anyhow, \nthe team is doing an amazing job, and the editions they are pulling out are amazing. \nReally top job with all the sections and compiling.
