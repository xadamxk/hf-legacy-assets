It is blatantly clear that Omnicoin has been struggling for quite some time now but we are starting to see members taking an interest by seeking information on how to mine, where to trade their Omnicoin, and brainstorming possible products and services that only accept Omnicoin as a form of payment.\n\nAnother member has inquired about possible products and services that may be offered for only Omnicoin in hopes of raising the Omnicoin market.  Some suggestions include stressers, CSGO items, OG names, and physical coins.  This is great news as more members seem to be willing to sacrifice some of their profits for the good of Omnicoin.\n\n[url=http://pool.omnicoin.cc/]Project Sparkle[/url], a mining pool created by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1439038]Doctor Blue[/url] has gone offline yet again for a short time making this the fourth consecutive week which the pool has had issues.

This is a great update for members who use euros as their primary form of payment as they will no longer have to calculate the exchange rate of Omnicoin to USD to EUR.\n\nA user by the name of [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2682887]Mr. Robot[/url][/b] has joined the top ten richest Omnicoin users with a balance of 100,032 OMC.

The website [url=http://www.rpg-gaming.com/fo4.html]RPG Gaming[/url] has created a page that lets players decide on their statistics for the upcoming videogame Fallout 4 before the game is officially released. It lets players choose their “name, gender, and skills to pour your point into,” along with what perks players would like their character to have. With this tool players will be able to spend less time on Fallout 4’s release date worrying about how to create their character and more time exploring the wasteland. Fallout 4 is set to be released on November 10, 2015. \n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-legion-expansion-release-window-/1100-6432037/][b][color=white]World of Warcraft: Legion Release Window Announced[/color][/b][/url]\nDuring the opening ceremony for BlizzCon 2015, the release window for the World of Warcraft expansion pack known as Legion was announced. The news comes a day after the online leak of the same information, saying that Legion is set to be released in the summer of 2016. The leak came from an image found on a Battle.net website that was an advertisement for the expansion pack. The advertisement stated the following: \"Expected game release on or before September 21st, 2016.\" Also found on the advertisement are details regarding pricing, pre-purchase bonuses, and bundles with other Blizzard titles. The beta for this new expansion is set to begin this year.\n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-movie-coming-in-2017-from-the-mummy-pr/1100-6432017/][b][color=white]Witcher Film To Be Released in 2017[/color][/b][/url]\nA film based on the Witcher series of videogames has been announced to arrive in 2017. The movie will be made by two production companies, one of which is the American company called The Sean Daniel Company and is responsible for The Mummy movie series, the other being a Polish company called Platige Films. Platige films is responsible for many cinematics in video games, such as in the Witcher 3 and Halo 5. Producers have confirmed that the film will have Geralt of Rivia as the main character, but that it won’t be a direct adaptation of any prior materials in the game series or novelizations. The film is expected to be the first in a series.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Gladly.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/sennheiser-unveils-40000-marble-clad-valve-amp-orpheus-headphones/][color=#FFFFFF][b]Sennheiser Unveils $55K Pair of Headphones[/b][/color][/url]\nAudio company Sennheiser has released a very pricey update on its highest quality line of headphones, the Orpheus line. The headphones retail for the very hefty price of $55,000. What sets this pair of cans apart from the competition? Unlike the drivers that most modern headphones use today for output sound, these Sennheisers use electrostatic charge to deliver sound to your ears. The charge sitting between two metal plates then creates extremely accurate sound reproduction. The headphones come with the full-marble amplifier needed to use the headphones, and the vacuum tubes sit on the top right of the amplifier. The power amp itself is integrated with the headphones themselves to avoid quality loss, according to Sennheiser. Although unaffordable to most, the new addition to the Sennheiser Orpheus line releases around mid-2016 for those who can justify purchasing it.\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/crypto-e-mail-service-pays-6000-ransom-gets-taken-out-by-ddos-anyway/][color=#FFFFFF][b]ProtonMail Gives in to Extortion from DDoS Group[/b][/color][/url]\nWith hundreds of Swiss websites going down as a result of a massive DDoS attack this week, email client ProtonMail underwent massive attacks at volumes of up to 100 GB/s to their various datacenters and routers. The group responsible for the attack targeted ProtonMail’s router nodes, resulting in the eventual takedown of the ISP itself. The DDoS group sent a ransom email to the company asking for bitcoins, which ProtonMail ended up paying. ProtonMail paid the attackers 15 BTC, which amounted to about $5,850 at the time. The company is working with other affected companies to research the attack and how they can better defend against attacks of such a large size.\n[url=http://www.wired.com/2015/11/c2sense/]\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]Artificial Nose Tells You When Food Spoils[/b][/color][/url]\nA device that may have many implications for the food industry, company C2Sense has created a device that can “smell” when food goes bad. The device works by detecting a chemical emitted by food that spoils, known as ethylene. Depending on the amount of ethylene, a sensor on the small device will change electric currents based on the amount of the chemical it has detected in the vicinity. The nose then measures it on a visible scale. The device is still not commercially available, although the company’s co-founder Jan Schnorr says she wants to be able to make the sensor cheaply available and to be useable in food packaging and other food related applications, such as in produce bags.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align]\n\n\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34743216][b][color=#FFFFFF]Putin Suspends All Flights from Russia to Egypt[/color][/b][/url]\nA plane departing Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, destined for Saint Petersberg, Russia, crashed last week killing 224 people. While the cause of the crash is still a mystery, there has been speculation that it was caused by a bomb that could have been placed in the cargo hold of the plane. In-flight recorders show that everything was normal and operating to standard until a sudden explosion. Militants from the Sinai Province group have claimed credit for the crash, but have not detailed how it was accomplished. Russia recently joined the list of countries who have suspended all flights to Egypt due to the increasing unrest. Other countries that have restricted flights are the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. \n\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34751370][b][color=#FFFFFF]US President Turns Down Keystone XL Pipeline Deal[/color][/b][/url]\nFriday November 6th, U.S. President Barrack Obama announced that he would reject the Keystone XL pipeline deal that has been disputed for the past seven years. Many have contested the pipeline plan, citing irreparable damage to the environment. The pipeline would have carried 800,000 barrels of oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska. Conservatives have made claims that the project would create jobs and lower gas prices. The Obama administration research has provided analysis to the contrary, saying that to move forward with this project would put the United States behind the rest of the world in the fight against climate change. \n\n[url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/07/us-china-taiwan-idUSKCN0SV2PU20151107][b][color=#FFFFFF]Leaders of China and Taiwan Meet For The First Time In 60 Years[/color][/b][/url]\nChina President Xi Jinping and Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou met last week, making history, as it was the first time the two nations had formally met since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The nationalist party of China in the 1940s retreated to Taiwan after losing the war, and the unrest between the two ideologically different countries has remained. Both leaders are committed to promoting peace throughout the region, though no specific measures have been planned.
