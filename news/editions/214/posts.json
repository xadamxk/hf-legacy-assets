Unless you're an idiot, this new system should be very easy to follow. There are new features, such as the fact that you can not gift Ub3r unless you are an Ub3r, the system now checks whether or not the UID you are gifting to exists, otherwise you get an error, and you cannot upgrade closed, banned, admin, or staff accounts. This new upgrade system now accepts BTC along with PayPal. The prices of each upgrade also changed, to $13 for 3p1c, $18 for L33T, and $25 for Ub3r. The upgrades will start to be automatic after [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] makes sure his code is running smoothly. You can read more about the new upgrade system [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4533576]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]New Feature: Verify Secret[/b][/color]\nOn November 7th, 2014 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] added a brand new feature; Verify Secret. What Verify Secret does is help with authenticating a buddy on XMPP and can also be used to ask a member to verify themselves in other situations as well. A help document for that can be found, [url=https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/help/4.0.0/authenticate.php]here[/url]. The XMPP will require OTR to work. If members using it want to authenticate, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] now has a simpler and more efficient way than sending PMs and in just five easy steps which can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4526830]here[/url]. To prevent secrets from being either reused or stolen, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made it so that a new secret is generated each day. Keep in mind though that doesn't mean every 24 hours, as it's all based on server time. You may also use this for other XMPP services using OTR as it will work exactly the same. Also, to find the Verify Secret feature on Hack Forums just simply click on the [url=http://hackforums.net/extras.php]Extras[/url] tab and click on Verify Secret. You can find [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] thread explaining all of it, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4526830]here[/url].\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/eBLLjui.png[/img]\n\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8cOBQgPP0o[/yt][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/c2aftti.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2177496][color=#00AAFF][b]bοxxy[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation points.\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]News Notables[/b][/color]\n[list][*] Seen a member of Hack Forums do something amazing for someone?

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] Hi, I'd like to shout out my mom, my m9 SAUX, my mat9 lingo, and Cody.    \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] How did you get to meet this group of characters? Your mom included.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] Ok, so this one time I was hitting on SAUX (I thought he was 15 at the time), he was quite shy and wouldn't speak on his mic because he was afraid of me. Then he loosened up (in both ways) and then we became m9s. My mom has always been there from the start, she tells me I'm very special and I'll be president one day. I met Lingo on beacon's MineCraft server. Cody just kind of came out of nowhere.    \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I think that Cody came out of the closet, not nowhere. So how did you end up finding Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] I was looking for ways to become the best hacker ever and have more slaves than anyone ever had, but someone ended up telling me that slavery was abolished in 1865 and that it was frowned upon. I ended up downloading about 78 e-books and never tried any of them.    \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] That's a lot of eBooks, have you find your money making niche yet? I hear you're apart of a pretty nice Minecraft server.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, Sox, Lingo & I own a pretty successful server. It's nice knowing that hundreds of players a day get on our server to have a good time. It's also nice that we make a good amount of money from it, but giving the players a fun experience is our top priority.    \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Mind sharing a little about the server? I'll give you guys a little advertising.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] It's a prison server and it's AMAZING!!!!!! Our IP is play.mineclash.com, If I recall correctly, you've actually played on it before.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url]  I did win $250 there recently. How long have you been hosting Minecraft servers? What made you get into it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] We started launched the server on the 21st of January of this year. I used to play on a prison server that Sox and Lingo were admins on, which was owned by one of our friends. I ended up getting admin on the server too. I guess our friend thought we played around too much and ended up demoting/banning us. So we started up our own server and brought the players we knew from there and it just started growing from there. We would be the ones always interacting with the players which I think is what helped us grow, since we had a good relationship with the players. We ended up buying the IP from our friend and routing all the players to our server. We actually had Tyrone do a \"review\" for our server when it was still called treepun.ch. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuAZ8t2mXk4    \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So what comes next after mineclash? I don't want to be a downer, but what comes next from Chef Hou?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'm planning on becoming the next best FIFA player in the world. That way I can't challenge anyone and bet money on myself and win. I will also try to become president just like mom says I will. Maybe I'll finally be able to adopt Cody and Sox and give them the warmth they need.    \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Pull Cody out of Canadaland, that would be a true miracle. So what's your favorite soccer team and how much have you spent of Fifa? I heard those cards are pretty pricey.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] I don't really follow futbol as much as I used to so I really don't have a favorite club team, but I'm a fan of the Netherlands national team. I've spent about $350 on fifa points and haven't got shit. Some might say opening packs is as addicting as opening clasher crates.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So it looks that Hacker Craft is launching back up, do you plan on playing? As a server owner will this server impact any of your activity?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] No, I really don't plan on playing. I might get on just to check it out, but the last time I went on Hacker Craft you really couldn't do anything other than make a farm for money. The whole server was basically a huge farm for the HC award which was super boring. I have no clue what they're planning on doing but I hope it's better than before. So it probably won't affect any of my activity.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's all the time we have for this interview do you have any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827057][color=white][b]HOUstoner:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I hate that you never play CS:GO with me. Also another shout out to Cody, I know it's hard to live in a time where most people have 2 arms but he has none :( 2 sox 4 being my m9\nand 2 lingo for being mat9 and fifers9[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777]Cooligan[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to this week's edition of the HF news! Today we're here with a fellow Writer, Cooligan. What's up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Not much man, just sitting here smoking and listening to some good music. Feeling positive vibes right now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds relaxing. Any shoutouts you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah. Shoutout to my boys Haze and Evangelist and all of my Phoenix noobs. <3\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] They seem pretty cool. Speaking of cool, how did you come up with your username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] I can't give all the credit to myself, most of it is Omniscient's. The day I donated for the ED award him and I got into a short conversation about my username and how I wanted to change it. He recommended Cooligan, I liked the way it looked and sounded so I chose it. I'm glad I did, it's really grown on me and I don't think I'll ever change it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] It's pretty unique, not gonna lie. So how were you introduced to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks :) I was introduced through a friend in an XBL party chat. One day he was talking about how you could buy Netflix accounts here super cheap and I wanted to check it out. So I registered and then after checking out those Netflix accounts I realized how awesome the community here is so I stayed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Nice, did you ever end up getting involved in the marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Nope, I never really had any intention to. I pretty much went straight for The Lounge and SRPP, I enjoyed both at that time. After that I started applying for groups, met some really cool people and here I am.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, the Lounge and groups are probably some of the most popular sections. With all these groups going for sale, how would you run one if you were an owner?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] That they are. I'd probably be criticized by this by some people but I'd run it almost exactly how The Empire was run. There would be no sectors, there would never be any member or leadership buy ins, and there wouldn't be any specific skills needed to join as in coding or marketing ect. It would be a general based group with group activities and projects. Something along the lines of that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] There's nothing wrong with that, you should be able to do whatever you want if you pay for a group! You mentioned earlier that you found HF through an Xbox party. Do you still game?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do. After we get through with this interview I'm gonna go play some Destiny or GTA V with some friends.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's a good idea, I'm really enjoying Destiny at the moment. So what do you do outside of HF? Do you have any hobbies or play any sports?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Not really any hobbies and I don't play any sports. I work a lot  and well, up until my recent break up I hung out with this girl in most of my free time. Other than that I mostly just chill with my friends and drink pretty often. I guess you could say I'm sort of direction-less right now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] So you go wherever life takes you, huh? Do you have a fun job?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty much, I just go with the flow. My job is alright yeah but lately it's been getting pretty irritating, there's a lot of drama at my job. I work at the service desk at a grocery store so I'm constantly talking with the supervisors and managers and basically, it causes a lot of drama. I'm probably going to try to find a new job soon.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Oh that doesn't sound fun. Any idea where you want to go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=777][color=white][b]Cooligan:[/b][/color][/url] Not yet, but I know I probably don't want to do anything with customer service.

After the termination of Silk Road 2.0, more than 400 other various online services such as itself were also shutdown. Operation Onymous is said to be one of the largest operations executed by globally-coordinated officials in 17 nations ranging from North America to Europe. During the sting, 17 people were apprehended and $1,000,000 Bitcoin was seized. Could the seizure of this amount of Bitcoin result in a spike in market price? We may soon find out.  \n\n[b][color=white]53 Million Email Addresses stolen from Home Depot[/color][/b]\nAfter the September attack on Home Depot which resulted in the leak of over 50 million credit cards, hackers are at it again. Home Depot has now confirmed that over 53 million email addresses have been stolen from their customer database. The company has reported that the hack could cost them roughly $62 million in damages. The hackers used a third-party vendor’s user name and password to enter Home Depots private network. If you happen to be someone who has given your email to Home Depot at one point or another, it would be safe to say that you can expect some spam mail in the near future. \n\n[b][color=white]New iOS Vulnerability Allows Hackers to Replace Apps with Malware[/color][/b]\nIt may seem like Andriod has been the long time target of Hackers, but now it seems like those hackers are shifting their focus to the widely used iOS devices made by Apple. While it is contrary that Apple has stated that their devices are extremely difficult to be breached by cyber criminals, sources now say that hackers have found a vulnerability allowing them to replace everyday apps with Malware. This is caused by a security flaw in Apple’s mobile operating system. It is said that the malicious apps can be used to replace legitimate apps, such as gaming, mobile banking, social media and other day-to-day applications. This vulnerability has been dubbed by FireEye as a “Masque Attack.”\n\n[color=white][b]Russian Domestic Internet Traffic Compromised[/b][/color]\nFor what may have been several months, domestic Russian internet traffic has been re-routed to other areas including Stockholm, Sweden; Los Angeles, California; Shanghai, China; and Frankfurt, Germany.  This error was caused by a malfunctioning router in the China Telecom network due to a weakness in the dynamic routing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). An agreement was signed by Russia allowing a process known as BGP Peering which would allow some traffic to be routed through existing and less expensive transit operators. Unfortunately, the Russian internet traffic provided by its largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) has been re-routed, and thus exposed, to numerous other countries. Over 7,000 routers and a routing table of over 326,000 entries was shared. This is not that uncommon of an issue, but its effects may possibly be detrimental. No major security news in this scenario has surfaced yet.\n\n[color=white][b]Man Charged for Carding $50 Million[/b][/color]\nCameron Harrison, a 28-year old Georgia resident, has been sentenced to nine years in prison and ordered to pay over $50 million in restitution for purchasing and using stolen credit cards online along with 26 of his partners. He purchased more than 250 stolen credit cards and was caught in a sting operation wherein he attempted to purchase a fake ID. Unbeknownst to him the seller, to whom he had admitted his crimes as a member of 'ShadowCrew,' was an undercover FBI agent. Harrison pleaded guilty to several charges including participation in and conspiracy of racketeering and trafficking and production of false identification documents. Harrison and several of his accomplices were sentenced to up to 9 years in federal prison, and the people behind the website [url=http://carder.su]carder.su[/url] were taken down.\n\n[color=white][b]Chinese Hackers Breach US Weather Systems[/b][/color]\nIt's not uncommon for the US to accuse China of taking part in state-sponsored cyberattacks, and a recent attack on the US weather satellite network has been traced back to a group of Chinese hackers. This resulted in the network being essentially sealed off for a short period. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) admitted to being the target of an attack late October, 2014, but the attacks took place mid-September. It took longer to get to the public light as the NOAA claimed that there were [i]\"no lasting effects\"[/i] of the attack. They claim to have risen their security standards, but the Chinese hackers, for years, have been determined to breach secure US networks.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1339278]Paragon[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Mac OSX Malware \"WireLurker\" Abolished[/color][/b]\nWireLurker, a new breed of OSX malware, has been put to rest. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks confirmed this morning that the infrastructure supporting WireLurker has been patched and Apple has revoked a legitimate digital certificate used to sign WireLurker code and allow it to infect non-jailbroken iOS devices. The motive of the attacks were unknown but the malware was capable of stealing system information and data stored on iOS devices, credit card and banking information remained untouched by any third parties.\n\n[b][color=white]”War...Flying?”[/color][/b]\nIt has been reported that US Marshals are now flying around in small Cessna planes, and collecting thousands of user’s mobile data. With the hopes to collect information on terrorist or criminal activities, these Cessnas have been known to fly mainly around airports, harvesting tens of thousands of different individual’s data. Acting as a mobile receiver for mobile data, the devices these Marshals use, nicknamed “dirtboxes” capture “unique identifying information” on those phones they take data from. Verizon has said that they had no idea that the Department of Defense was going through with the aforementioned harvesting, and the DoD has yet to comment on the matter.\n\n[b][color=white]AT&T Cricket Email Encryption “Attacks” [/color][/b]\nAT&T’s subsidiary service “Cricket” has been identified as a culprit in an attack that could potentially, and might already have, exposed numerous “encrypted” emails. Said to have removed the STARTTLS flag placed on the emails at the time of sending, Cricket renders the STARTTLS encryption placed on emails useless, due to it not encrypting anything in the first place. The proponent for internet privacy “Goldenfrog” has accused Cricket of sabotaging its users. Although the STARTTLS interception attacks have been seen as perhaps not purposely done by Cricket, the issue is still being investigated.\n\n[b][color=white]Multi-Version Windows Bug Disclosed[/color][/b]\nSaid to rest in the SSL (secure sockets layer) and TLS (transport layer security) protocols of Windows-based servers, and perhaps even laptops and desktops. The flaw affecting the SSL library “SCHANNEL” in Windows systems is said to “leave client machines open if users run software that monitors Internet ports and accepts encrypted connections.” This means that any program that listens to any port securely on the system would render the system vulnerable. Microsoft has stated that they will release an immediate patch for this and numerous other bugs this Tuesday (the 18th). The vulnerability is labeled as the following: “SCHANNEL vulnerability, CVE-2014-6321” and will be patched in “MS14-066”.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]CS:GO Launches Operation Vanguard[/color][/b]\nValve, the developers of the popular FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, has released six new maps chosen by the community. Operation Vanguard is currently the fifth event going on for CS:GO. Players will be able to purchase Operation Vanguard, which not only includes the new community maps, but a new \"Operation Campaigns\" series of events. Campaigns will be made-up of several different missions within the series of the game. Valve explains that when you successfully complete a mission you will receive a Vanguard drop, which provides the player with a case including different items. The drop will be randomized; either you get a Vanguard case drop or a random weapon. Completing missions will earn you more upgrades so players will be expected to focus on the challenges to receive points and upgrade your \"Operation Vanguard Challenge Coin.\" In addition, the Arms Race gamemode has been updated as well. New rules and three new maps have been added for players to enjoy.\n\n[b][color=white]WoW Has Its First Level-100 Players[/color][/b]\nHours after the release of the new World of Warcraft expansion Warlords of Draenor was released dedicated players reached the level cap, which is level-100. Blizzard states, \"There are already plenty of level-100 players running around Azeroth, following the expansion's release at midnight last night.\" Using the  \"/who 100\" command will allow players to see who's a level-100 on their server. Blizzard tested the command on the European server Bloodscalp. Bloodscalp had 24 level-100 players roaming their server. Outstanding indeed. It's said that these players were lucky enough to reach these levels so fast because they had access to the beta. Beta players knew where and what to do, as well as power-leveling strategies to get the edge over other players.\n\n[b][color=white]Halo: The Master Chief Collection Matchmaking Issues Persist[/color][/b]\nAs a new game comes out, no one should really expect perfect up-time the first few days of multiplayer gameplay. Microsoft has tried their best to fix Halo's connectivity problems by releasing a new update, which will improve the time it takes to join a matchmaking game. Sadly, the update hasn't been a success for everyone. Those who haven't gotten into a game yet, or have waited long times to join one, will notice that Halo: MCC has a very lengthy matchmaking time despite the number of gamers playing. 343 Industries has been working as hard as they can to find a solution for the problem. Following the updates, 343 also changed the playlists from 4v4 to 5v5, which may also cause uneven teams. Not only is the multiplayer buggy, but so is the achievement system and player stats. 343 states: \"The 343 team continues to work around the clock to provide ongoing improvements to the experience for Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Thank you for the ongoing patience and support.\" Hopefully the servers will be back to normal sometime this week.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of November 14, 2014:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Pure Pool - Xbox One - November 14, 2014\n[*]Terraria - Xbox One - November 14, 2014\n[*]This War of Mine - Linux, Mac, PC - November 14, 2014\n[*]Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom - Nintendo 3DS, PC,  Play Station 3, Play Station Vita, Xbox 360 - November 18, 2014\n[*]Company of Heroes 2 - Ardennes Assault - PC - November 18, 2014\n[*]Dragon Age: Inquisition - PC, Play Station 3, Play Station 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One - November 18, 2014\n[*]Escape Dead Island - PC, Play Station 3, Xbox 360 - November 18, 2014\n[*]Far Cry 4 - PC, Play Station 3, Play Station 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One - November 18, 2014\n[*]Grand Theft Auto V - Play Station 4, Xbox One - November 18, 2014\n[*]LittleBigPlanet 3 - Play Station 3, Play Station 4 - November 18, 2014\n[*]Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - Play Station 3, Xbox 360 - November 18, 2014\n[*]Never Alone - PC, Play Station 4, Xbox One - November 18, 2014\n[*]Watch Dogs - Wii U - November 18, 2014\n[*]WWE 2K15 - Play Station 4, Xbox One - November 18, 2014\n[*]Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms - PC - November 20, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[align=center][sp=Gaming Video of the Week][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9RCqhpgdIE&list=UUEXFSf2qoF4ZNZ5sSBsYIkw[/yt][/sp]\n[/align]\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/i1QkwoE.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \n\n[b][color=white]Samsung Announces \"Project Beyond\"[/color][/b]\nThat's right, the virtual reality revolution has started. Samsung officially announced their new 3D camera made specifically for virtual reality. The camera can capture 360-degree footage. Even more amazing, because the camera captures everything around it, the camera gathers over 25 GB of data per second. Samsung says that the camera, dubbed \"Project Beyond,\" will also have lightning fast connectivity. Because of the camera's connection speed, there will be absolutely no latency. This camera opens doors for virtual reality tours of cities and other historic places. The ideas for virtual reality are endless, and this camera is a large step forward in a virtual world. Yes folks, it is a fully working device, and not just an idea. \n\n[b][color=white]Spark: Add WiFi to Any Device[/color][/b]\nNot only is technology becoming smarter, but it's also becoming smaller. The spark has created a new small board that allows you to add an internet connection to almost any device with little technical knowledge. Spark calls this wireless networking board \"Photon\" and it is on sale for only $20. Possibly the cheapest wireless networking board on the market, and the most unique. There are also cheaper boards for common devices that are as cheap as $10. All of those prices are great considering the original expected listing price of $40.\n\n[b][color=white]Brew Coffee Via WiFi[/color][/b]\nMr. Coffee and Belkin are working together to create an automated coffee brewing machine. Belkin is already known for stepping into the home automation scene, but a coffee maker is a brand new idea. Mr. Coffee calls their new WiFi equipped coffee machine the \"Smart Coffee Maker\" and it is able to brew up to 10 cups of coffee, which satisfies even the most dedicated coffee drinkers. In order to control the coffee machine, there is a custom app which allows you to schedule brewing times, check if the machine needs cleaning, and even power the machine on or off. Also, according to Belkin there is a new \"Optimal Brew\" technology, which supposedly increases the speed of brewing. So if you need to get that cup of joe early in the morning, this $150 machine is a great addition to your kitchen.\n\n[b][color=white]Skype For Web Beta Released[/color][/b]\nSkype web beta has been released to a small few members of Skype. Perhaps a step in the right direction for Microsoft's lack of security regarding Skype in the past. That saying, maybe it will help prevent IP lookups if using the web version only. For now, it will require browser plugins, but they have reported that once it is out of beta, it shouldn't require any plugins and should be able to run natively without any add-ons. For now, it is only available for users of the Chrome web browser.\n\n[b][color=white]Google Wallet API End Of Life[/color][/b]\nGoogle has decided that they will end Google Wallet's API on March 2nd, 2015. At that time it will cease to work, so you have up until then to use it and find another solution for your products. After that time, you will only have access to the merchant panel for issuing refunds and transferring your money elsewhere. Of course, they will continue to use Wallet for themselves and within the Google Play Store, so this will not effect app developers on the Play Store.\n\n[b][color=white]Artificial Muscles Created With Muscle Memory[/color][/b]\nThe University of Cambridge researchers has created artificial muscles that can store and learn your bodies movements, just like your biological muscles. This muscle memory technology is a breakthrough in technology as it is the first time that artificial body parts could contain and retain memory. Muscle memory technology opens the doors to more technological advances and seems like something out of a science-fiction movie. It will effect the future of prosthetics, robotics and exoskeletons according to researchers. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
