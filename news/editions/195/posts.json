In the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4237906][b]announcement thread[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] states that the policy is in effect immediately and that all threads currently owned by normal or L33t members may be closed at staff discretion. Paid stickies in the section purchased by non-Ub3r members will remain open and stuck until their expiration. While disappointing to many regular members or L33t members who have been permanently denied Ub3r, a reduction of new threads in the Deal Dispute section is to be expected.\n\n[color=white][b]10,000 OMC Website Design Contest Winners[/b][/color]\nIn the past week, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread in the GFX Contests section asking users to come up with a design for the Omnicoin.org website, which is dedicated to the popular crypto-currency \"OmniCoin\". In return, he promised the winners of the first, second, and third places a reward of 10,000, 1,000, and 500 OMC, respectively. Many members put forth their best effort, some coming up with wonderful designs while other chose to insult committed works. In the end, the winners [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4227532&pid=40168506#pid40168506][b]were announced[/b][/url] and a design by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1290620][color=#EFEFEF][b]Designer[/b][/color][/url] took the first place.

Being another automated feature to save staff time, the [url=http://hackforums.net/selfban.php][b]Self Banning Page[/b][/url] allows Ub3r members to select a time period for which to auto-ban themselves. The choices are 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, or 6 months. The ban will cause members to lose access to their accounts for that time period and it has been made clear that the ban will under no circumstances be lifted early. Benefits of banning yourself includes account security during a vacation. Upon receiving the ban, the reason will be stated as \"Vacation\" and email PM notifications will be disabled.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Uquxypc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 prestige.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451][color=#EFEFEF][b]Farmer Yellows[/b][/color][/url] has reached 2,000 reputation points.\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Member Highlights[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] Seen a member of Hack Forums do something amazing for someone?

This new feature was announced around midnight on the 17th of May. This will serve both as an aid to users, Staff, and Admins, easing up on their workload. This is just one of the upcoming features Omniscient has planned for the 3p1c usergroup in the near future. Stay tuned, this magician has many other tricks up his sleeve.\n\n[b][color=white]Omnicoin Surpasses 20,000 Blocks Mined[/color][/b]\nOmnicoin is one fifth of the way to its first halving. After one month, twelve days, Omnicoin hit a major milestone of 20,000 blocks, or 1,337,000 coins mined. It's right on par with the average amount of time it should take to hit the halving. This shows Omnicoin's doing quite well in terms of stability, and should continue to maintain stability throughout its life-cycle.\n\n[color=white][b]New Competitions to Encourage more Users to use Omnicoin[/b][/color]\nFollowing up on Omniscient's 2,000 OMC competition, the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1881806]Jack Sparrow™[/url] has suggested a 25,000 OMC tutorial contest. The 25,000 OMC have been spread across the first place and runner-ups, resulting in 1x10,000 OMC, 2x5,000 OMC and 5x1,000 OMC prizes. The submission thread can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4226430]here[/url] and the contest ends on the 1st of June. Moreover Omniscient has given out a 10,000 OMC bounty to the user with the best website design, aimed at the new official Omnicoin website omnicoin.org. The competition was won by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1290620]Designer[/url] and the new design is already live on the website.\n\n[color=white][b]New Marketplace Section for Exclusive Omnicoin Offers[/b][/color]\nA new subsection has been added to the premium sellers section, with the purpose of further highlighting exclusive Omnicoin offers, that is offers which are only purchaseable with Omnicoins. These exclusive offers might be just what Omnicoin needs in order to get known across the forums.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yVoOuuj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4218453][b]How to Track Your Stolen Laptop.[/b][/url] - [url=How to Track Your Stolen Laptop.][b]Mr.Chargen[/b][/url] - This user explains how to use a program to track your laptop if it had been stolen.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4219281][b]How to root ANY Android Phone.[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2281450][b]-----[/b][/url] - For the newer android users, this thread, and the following posts may be helpful for rooting your phone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4215221][b]DiamondMarketers | $1,500 WORTH OF PRIZES[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1844751][b]Dr. R[/b][/url] - Another massive contest, for many financially challenged on the forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4231036][b]My gamer story and my frustration with IRL friends.[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2106326][b]Kayoz[/b][/url] - An interesting background and description of the user Kayoz's gaming career.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4226303][b]Common Lingo | A guide to understanding the HF language[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2209419][b]MI-6[/b][/url] - For the newer members on Hack Forums this thread may be helpful.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4232075][b]Please read this article and learn from it[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor[/b][/url] - If you've purchased BlackShades, or any other RAT in the past year or so, you might want to check out this thread.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4229971][b]Get your username on a cartoon *10 New Pics*[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2163119][b]Snores[/b][/url] - Check out this thread for an oddly disturbing, yet free picture of your username on a template.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4203652][b]FREE Thread Design - HQ [Download Link inside][/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=43211][b]Griffin[/b][/url] - If you're too lazy to make your own thread design, take a look at this free template provided by Griffin.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/IDI7isd.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694]OhMyQuad[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url]  Welcome to 195th edition of the HF News, today we're here with OhMyQuad. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] Hello, thanks for having me, shout-out to Banish, Proficient and K4Y3, great guys who i've recently started working with.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What are you guys working on together? Not a bad group of guys, I've seen them around.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] I do a lot in the social networking section, we all run our own services but we all help each other out through what we can, giving advice on how to improve and just generally making the section a lot nicer for the customers. We're also working on a thread that's about giving a bit back to the community, it's a work in progress and is being updated as we go along, but it's basic money making guides showing a few methods which i've used myself to make a bit of money with support from myself and everyone listed above.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Giving back is always good. So tell me about the social networking market, how does the average person get into that type of thing? How competitive is the market?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] The market is always quite competitive, as it's rather easy to get in to starting these services so people always keep pushing the prices down so you have to be up to date on the pricing. However we're all a friendly bunch. I've actually written a brief guide on how to get in to social media services which can be found here: http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4096083 for anyone who is interested.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Thread looks pretty nice. I've seen the market and it looks pretty tough. So what do you do outside of the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] I actually run my own business, I was always interested in working for myself, so along with my old boss we started an online store that is linked with eBay selling a variety of electrical goods, outside of work though I spend a lot of time at the ice rink, I've been going for roughly 3 years now, I'm a freestyle ice skater (which is a mix between break dancing and figure skating) but I also play a bit of ice hockey when I have the time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Definitely not the answer I was expecting, pretty interesting. I'm a huge hockey fan, what's your favorite team? I'd also like to quickly add in GO HAWKS! How did you get into freestyle skating? I gotta YouTube it for a better reference.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] Well unfortunately as i live in the UK there's not too many teams, however as i grew up watching them I've got to support my local team the Peterborough Phantoms. With freestyle ice skating i just started skating with my friends, we saw people trying tricks on the ice and we just copied (and fell a lot) until we got to be able to do it, three years later I'm being the one that people watch and think \"I want to be able to do that\" at some point I would love to be able to do Red Bull Crashed Ice, looks like it would be great fun!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds pretty cool. What do you do with your eBay business? Seems like an interesting way to make money and from the sounds of it you're quite successful. How did you get into it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] With eBay we actually have it linked to a magento ecommerce site which we also run. At the time of starting we were doing industrial LED lighting, we were approached by our wholesaler asking if we wanted to work on an opportunity with them, as they had an account that had run off with a large amount of money they needed someone else to start bringing in a reasonable amount with them. So we said yes and have been working off with them listing a large variety of products ranging from light bulbs and batteries to fridges, washing machines and large industrial air conditioning units. It's a good opportunity for anyone, but it's a lot of hard work listing thousands of products to eBay. However nobody got successful by sitting around waiting for money to come to them. This is something that i believe anybody here could do, i picked up the software within a couple of weeks and just worked hard.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Hard work pays off, glad to hear it was a success. What's the meaning behind your username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] That's a good question, I'm not actually sure, I started using it at the time when operator perry was saying \"QUAAAAAD\" a lot and i was heavily playing call of duty, and i think one of my friends just jokingly said oh my quad after i had gotten a quad and it just fit, so i started using it and it just stuck really.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I wasn't sure if it was religious related or gaming related, but I figured I'd at least ask. Do you still game? If so what console and games do you play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] I rarely have time to game any more, however you can't beat a bit of minecraft or gta 5 with your friends after a long day at work. Personally after having a couple of xbox consoles fail on me, i'm playstation all the way, bought my first one on the day of release and it's still working well to this day, now have a total of three, one at my dads house, another at my mums and another at work for when me and my boss/business partner want to just have a bit of a laugh.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Gaming in the workplace? Sounds pretty badass to me. So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] Especially considering my boss/business partner is in his 40s, he's also an active mmo player and is actually very heavily into crypto currency and has a large amount of OMC so it's rather difficult at times to just not spend hours talking about gaming and spending hours on hackforums. I found hackforums after an old runescape cheating community which i was very fond of shut down i was lost as to where to spend my time, so i stumbled across one day and just thought i'd learn a bit more about the world of the internet. I liked the community, formed a few friends and stuck around. Don't regret it at all and now i have a bit more money i'm starting to give back to the community in terms of donating and helping anyone who wants my help.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] You've been here about 2 years now, what's one thing you'd like to see changed on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] The quality of the eBooks, you see so many people buying them and they post after \"i already knew this method\" and people are just selling methods that are already known, there are very few that are unique or offer the level of detail needed to guide people. Other than that there isn't anything i would change.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree, I've never been a fan of eBooks myself and miss the reviewers. Last question I've for you for today, how would you rate your overall HF experience on a 1-10 scale.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] I believe the reviewers would be a great way of managing the quality of eBooks. I would say it's an 8 out of 10, i enjoy my time on here. Thank you for having me today, was a lot of fun.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Skipping ahead on me a tad bit, gotta do my finale.

Do you have any concluding remarks you'd like to make for us?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1353694][color=white][b]OhMyQuad:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry, thought i'd get it in there early just to make sure i was being polite!

Do you have any shout-out's you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] I am doing great. Thanks for having me! I would love to send a big shout-out to my buddy ComplexCube!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So what inspired you to register with HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] Haha. Well I remember playing video games and people always threatened to DDoS me. So I looked into it a bit more and eventually ran into HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Ah of course. Lol. I haven't seen you around the forums too much. Mind sharing some general information about yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] I was one of the creepers for a very long time. Trying to make money or learn how to \"hack\". I started giving back to the community in Feb 2013. And recently I have been much more active.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Did you end up learning how to \"hack\"?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] I was into RATs for about a year then decided I wasn't going to pursue it for much longer as it was pushing moral boundaries at some point.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] If you could change one thing about HF what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] I find too many better known upgraded members being complete assholes to the new people and I am sure that it would be hard for me to want to stay if my first experience is bad. Be nicer people!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I see, so what are you up to these days?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] I was into HackerCraft for a bit and found the continuous grind too much for me. Lately I have just been chillin in lounge and selling my only product at the moment, Instalike.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] How are the sales doing? Are you working alone on that or do you have a team?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] Sales were doing pretty great last month and have seemed to slow down.  My buddy ComplexCube is the one who coded this. He's a great programmer!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Would you like to explain to the readers what it is your product does?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] It is a bot that pretty much does free advertising of your IG account for you, which in turn increase your followers and likes. It is not like a social media panel where you buy followers. It uses your account to like, comment, or follow other users, and has a delay to keep yourself within Instagram limits.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's cool. Seems like it would be really useful for getting your account out there. Do you have any other future plans/goals you'd like to achieve on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] I would like to join a group eventually. I don't know which one is right for me at the moment, but I am a gamer/businessman so I have options. I also think that the Militant award is pretty sexy!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I'd agree with that last part. It's nice to be apart of group but don't obsess over it like many do. It's just a group on a forum site. That being said maybe Instinct or Respawn? Anyway, thanks for joining us today. If you have anything else you'd like to say please do so now\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662860][b]mashuginaH:[/b][/url] Either would be cool, as long as they are chill. I just want to say thanks to you Clark and the rest of the news team for putting in the time to do this every edition.[/spoiler]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

This update is nearly a quarter of a gigabyte in terms of data; however, soon after the update was released information that there was a big security hole was released. Apple's Security Bulletin described the nature of the problem: \"Upon each reboot, the permissions for the /Users and /Users/​Shared directories would be set to world-writable, allowing modification of these directories.\" While this doesn't affect everyone, it is a problem none the less that needed to be fixed. So, Apple needed to edit and resent out its massive update once more to iTune users. \n\n[color=white][b]Facebook and Google Working Together[/b][/color]\nRecently Google and Facebook have announced that they are cracking down on tech support scammers. They have suspended 4,000 suspicious advertiser accounts, which account for roughly 2,400 scam tech support agencies. Basically, it is a new very powerful colation to try to effectively stop these malicious companies and the bad ads which promote them. They have a website named [url=http://trustinads.org/index.html]TrustInAds.org[/url]. These bad companies are doing more than just randomly calling people now, using ads to get people to call them. From there to try to get users to download and install malicious apps with the intent to make money.\n\nThe real threat of these kind of attacks is that they are starting to look more professional, and as the older generation is starting to see a rise in technology they may not be savvy enough to detect these very malicious attacks. Featuring full scale websites, professional looking graphics, and some form of a business model they are able to con people. In addition ads networks and SEO make them a very profitable business, letting them truly infest the market. This gives publishers and ad providers a bad name, and makes other true technical sites look bad. \n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nContinuing on the previous point, there is a true need for people to report not only malicious ads, but links, and downloads. Sites like [url=https://www.virustotal.com/]VirusTotal[/url], [url=http://trustinads.org/index.html]TrustInAds[/url], and various other security sites are always on the look out for bad sites, ads, and other dangers against the general online user. While most people won't report sites, many of them rely on these services. By using these sites and doing a tiny bit of work it can make a massive dent in online attacks and thievery. You can report things from phishers, infected files, malicious webpages, and even bad ads. Even e-mailing a hosting provider is a vital tool to sometimes getting these scammers off of the net.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\nRestructuring.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Praying Mantis Discovered in Rwanda[/color][/b]\nResearchers discovered a species of praying mantis in Nyungwe National Park that hunts like a tiger which is the reason why they decided to call it \"bush tiger mantis.\" Riley Tedrow, a Case Western Reserve University evolutionary biology student led the research and was amazed that the females hunt lower in the vegetation while males hunt higher since they have wings. Luckily, the scientists were able to catch a female bush tiger mantis that laid an egg, enabling the scientists to study this rare species at every stage of its lifespan. The scientists urge the authorities to place the park under protection to ensure that these critters can continue to live. \n\n[b][color=white]Pneumonia Bacteria Can Grow in Windshield Washer Fluid[/color][/b]\nA new study shows that a pneumonia bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease can grow in the windshield washer fluid that's used in cars. Those who are most susceptible to the bacteria are older people because of their weakened immune systems. Researchers also examined the windshield fluid from Arizona school buses and found that 75 percent of the buses windshield fluid was contaminated with the bacteria. The bacteria could survive in the fluids from days to weeks, however, warm climate contributes to its survival which can extend its lifetime.\n\n[b][color=white]'Albino' Gene Found in Dogs[/color][/b]\nA study by researchers at Michigan State University find that certain dogs carry a gene mutation that causes albinism. Paige Winkler, a doctoral student in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University, stated that the mutation was caused by a missing protein that is necessary for cells to be pigmented. The skin of albino dogs, just as in humans, are sensitive to sunlight which increases its vulnerability to skin tumors. The researchers studied 20 albino dogs and 20 colored dogs, finding out that all the albino dogs had at least one tumor while only one colored dog had a tumor. \n\n[b][color=white]Research Shows That Wild Animals Run The Wheel For The Lulz [/color][/b]\nTwo Researchers in Netherlands did an original experiment with wild mice behaviors towards the wheel. The researchers placed exercise wheels in a garden, and monitored the wheels with motion detectors that triggered cameras to start collecting valuable data towards the experiment. It resulted in wild mice, rats, and even frogs to run the wheel. Gene D. Block, chancellor of the University of California, claimed that the study shows the act of animals running on the wheel is a \"rewarding behavior\", and not compelled from anxiety.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Verizon Launching Improved Mobile Data Known As 'XLTE'[/b][/color]\nVerizon has really been ramping up their data availability for a while now, but now they're really going to put all that space to work with their new XLTE service. We can see that from a recent TV ad by Verizon, that they have revealed plans to improve 4G speeds under this new name. The new banner promises better performance in applicable areas. Currently, Verizon states that if you live in the region where XLTE is available, you will get double the bandwidth and much higher peak speeds. Folks who live in test areas have confirmed that the increase in speed is noticeable. Verizon will supposedly be announcing it fully on May 19th. Until then, all we can do is wait.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft Makes Data Pretty With Light Show[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft put on a pretty amazing light show recently, known as the Infinity Room. The Infinity Room was a temporary art installation, that used data to put on a fabulous light show. The project, itself, used LED lights and spheres which were all choreographed to give the impression that you were standing among the data. The whole thing was available for a few days, but sadly it has been taken down now. Microsoft has put up a 360-degree version of it though, which you should definitely check out. \nIf you want to see the Infinity Room in all its glory, click [url=http://insightsawait.brightkit.com/?WT.mc_id=Web_SQL_aprilmomt_stunt]Here[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]Google Maps' Bike Routes Help You Avoid Challenging Routes[/b][/color]\nA lot of people like cycling, but that doesn't mean that they all want to have a challenge when going for a ride. Google Maps' update to bike routing looks to fix this problem to give cyclists much safer, easier routes to ride if they so choose. Google has recently added elevation data to the route info when you input it. If you set your path on a desktop, you can see visual and data representation of the changes in elevation to help you plan your route according. This could mean there are big things in the future to all of Maps itself.\n\n[color=white][b]AT&T Relaunches Cricket With 4G Coverage[/b][/color]\nCricket was taken down about a year ago, when AT&T acquired them. News comes now from AT&T that Cricket is being relaunched with nationwide 4G coverage. Cricket customers have to purchase new devices so they can access 4G, and this will include LTE. All the plans on Cricket include unlimited calling and texting, with international texting to 35 countries. The plans come at $35, $45, and $55 monthly and includes 500MB, 2.5GB, and 5GB of data, respectively. Cricket offers group discounts for people, taking off money per line you add. Also a big feature of Cricket is that you won't pay for data overages, you will be capped at 128 Kbps instead.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

On both consoles it will cost $19.99 stand along, however, if you've bought Minecraft for the PS3 or XB360 in the past, you can upgrade to the next gen version for a mere $5. Feature wise, the PS4 and XB1 editions will not be cross-playable with XB360 and PS3 versions. The draw distance and world size will be increased as well in the new editions. Along with this a majority of the skins and texture packs purchased on the PS3 or XB360 editions will transfer over to the new versions. Also, worlds will not be importable immediately when the new editions are released, but 4J Studios intends on adding the feature in the near future.\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Halo Updates for the week of May 18, 2014[/b][/color]\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Halo 5: Guardians Announced[/b][/color][/size]\nIn a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft announced and detailed next installment in the Halo franchise, Halo 5: Guardians. The game will launch of the Xbox One in the fall of 2015 and as with every Halo game since the debut of Combat Evolved in 2001, it will be a massive and exciting project. In the blog post, it states: \"“Halo 5: Guardians” is a bigger effort than “Halo 4.”  That applies to the content and scope of the game, as well as the technology in what’s now a brand new and more powerful engine.  Certainly there are some core elements carried over from prior games, but we've invested a huge effort in retooling our tech to take full advantage of the Xbox One’s hardware and ecosystem to create worlds and experiences worthy of next-gen.\" 2015 should be a big year for Microsoft, 343 Industries, and the Halo franchise, with the launch of both the Halo television series made with the legendary Steven Spielberg and the highly anticipated Halo game for the Xbox One.\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Halo: The Master Chief Collection rumored[/b][/color][/size]\nIn a report from Engadget this week, a remastered collection the first four games of the main Halo series could make its way to the Xbox One. The report names the collection \"Halo: The Master Chief Collection\", which would include Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4, and would be expected for a release during the fall. The Master Chief Collection could be aimed to give gamers a refresh of Master Chief's story before the release of Halo 5: Guardians, which will be released next year. Because it is a collection of games based around Master Chief, Halo 3: ODST and Halo: Reach are not expected to be included in the collection. This project has not been confirmed by Microsoft of 343 Industries, the developers, resolution, and frame rate are not known at this time.\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Destiny Updates for the week of May 18, 2014[/b][/color]\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Beta Release Date Hinted[/b][/color][/size]\nIn Bungie's weekly update last week, it was hinted that something is being big is being planned for Bungie day 2014, and that we will be getting a release date for the Destiny Beta at E3 in just a few short weeks. It is stated in the weekly update, \"Bungie Day is about the entire Bungie Community at large, so we’ll do something special that everyone can enjoy. At the same time.\" This is hinting that we could see the beta out for everyone by Bungie Day, since the beta will be available for Playstation users first, and it can be assumed that they will have the beta a week in advance which would be July 1st and seven days later would then be Bungie Day, July 7.\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Release Dates for the Week of May 18, 2014:[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]Transistor - PC, PlayStation 4 - May 20, 2014\n[*]Wolfenstein: The New Order - PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One - May 20, 2014\n[*]The Forest - PC - May 22, 2014\n[*]Killer is Dead: Nightmare Edition - PC - May 23, 2014\n[*]Tropico - PC - May 23, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Notable Gaming Threads and Events[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4236321][b]List of Free Xbox 360 arcade games[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2282100]Dragga[/url] - Looking for a new game to play on your 360?

The member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url] recently posted a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4228529]thread [/url] regarding the decrease in activity, in which players (and ex-players) voiced their opinion about why Hackercraft is dying and what Omniscient can do about it. In general, the Hackercraft community pleads for the reintroduction of factions and PVP. This would change the server's focus from farming to PVP and raiding, similar to the original (and highly active) Hackercraft. When Omniscient introduced the first Hackercraft award over a year ago, eager farmers fled to fertile land to rack up a mere 50,000 or so in-game money to purchase the shiny award; along the way, those players were able to raid the farms and bases of others and sell the loot for profit. Now, a year and a half later, only a handful of those original players remain and the same premise (minus the fun of raiding) is beginning to bore most of the community. Hackercraft is not the same as it used to be for many. Players want to go back to the days of Terror, when Wolves stalked their prey and we all fled The Company of Chad. What do you think about the current state of Hackercraft?

The explosions happened in the city of Jos in a busy market near a bus terminal. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but the city has seen many deadly clashes between Christian and Muslim groups in recent years. It has been reported tension has been rising in the area with some youths blocking off roads. Religious leaders appeal for calm, though all of this has come amongst the 200 girls who were kidnapped from a boarding school in Nigeria. The government claims to be doing its best to track down the girls.\n\n[color=white][b]Thailand's Army Imposes Martial Law[/b][/color]\nGrowing feuds between the government and anti-government protests has forced Thailand's army to enforce a martial law. Thailand's acting PM has pleaded for the army to act peacefully and within the constitution, he has also asked for new elections to take place in August. The martial law was announced on television at 03:00 local time with the intention to \"preserve order\", though anti-government protesters vowed the martial law would not affect their campaign to topple the administration. So far the atmosphere appears calm in Thailand and the Army chief Gen Prayuth Chan-Ocha said the martial law will stay in affect until \"the country is safe and there is stability.\" Soldiers have currently taken over TV and Radio stations in Bangkok.\n\n[color=white][b]13 Killed in Syria Missile Strike[/b][/color]\n13 people have been killed, including 8 children in a devastating missile attack on the town of Marea in north-east Syria. The missile hit overnight while most residents were sleeping, witnesses told the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that the missile may have been fired by a government warplane. On Tuesday morning it was also reported another aerial attack killed 10 more people in a nearby town, Azaz. All this feud and violence is amongst the ongoing struggle in Syria, where reports of chemical bombs have also been used and more than 160,000 estimated to have been killed. A further 9.5 million have been driven away from their homes caused by the uprising against President Assad which began in March 2011.\n\n[color=white][b]India's Largest and Longest Election[/b][/color]\nDuring the past few weeks, India has been busy voting for its next Prime Minister. The election ran from 7th April to 12th May, making it the country's longest election to date. Along with this an estimated 550 million have voted, making this the biggest election in the world so far. Results for the election were announced on the 16th of may, with the National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party winning and taking 336 seats. BJP itself won 282 seats, which means it can now govern without the support of other parties, the first time this has happened since 1984. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi is set to take over on the 31st of May.\n\n[b][color=white]Godzilla Of Dinosaurs Fossils Found[/color][/b]\nPaleontologists in Argentia Patagonia region have discovered fossilized remains of a Titanosaur which could of been the largest dinosaur to ever live. Titanosaur was a long-tailed and long-necked Sauropod that lived during the Cretaceous Period nearly 95 million years ago. A Tianosaur weighed around 100 tons, which is equal to more than 14 African elephants and could of weighed over 77 tons. The Titanosaurs bones are among 200 fossils discovered at the Patagonia region site.Currently the largest dinosaur to date is one found in India estimated to be over 220 tons, though this opinion remains controversial as the estimate is based on very few bones. Jack Horner, who advised on the Jurassic Park movies refuses to believe this is the \"biggest\" dinosaur yet \"It's like a fish story [by an angler], it really is. The science will come after, when they start studying the thing.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Fatal Train Crash In Russia[/color][/b]\nAt 08:38 GMT carriages on a goods train derailed near Bekasovo, 1 station 37 miles from Moscow. The derailed carriages crashed into a passenger train carrying approximately 400 people from Moscow to Chisinau in Moldova. One of the passenger train carriages was crushed by the goods train wagons. Officials have stated that 6 people have died, 5 at the scene and 1 in hospital with the death total expecting to rise. Rescue coordinator Vadim Andronov said \"Rescuers are working to pull injured people who are being crushed by the wagon\". Oleg Salaguay a spokesman of the health ministry said that rescue crews and medical teams were doing everything they could to save lives. The cause of the accident is currently unknown. \"We tried to use an emergency brake. We couldn't see anything ahead, there was lots of dust,\" described one of the drivers of the passenger train.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ndzWS1q.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Another Icon Back From The Dead[/b][/color]\nMichael Jackson's hologram is going to be performing at the Billboard Music Awards. After a fuss with the Billboard industry and Hologram USA Inc. over rights to the hologram, they eventually were granted permission by a judge to use it. Hologram USA Inc. were the creators of the Tupac Shakur hologram and other famous holograms at the Coachella Music Festival; it's not hard to see why they're upset, Hologram USA Inc. is losing money by this happening! Additionally, the King of Pop is going to be performing a track from [i]Xscape[/i] \"Slave to the Rhythm.\" [i]Xscape[/i]—being his most recent album release since his passing— is hitting success. Although, it's not the real MJ, it's the best we're going to get!\n\n[color=white][b]What Was Frozen, Now Has Melted[/b][/color]\nThe soundtrack that had 13 consecutive weeks as #1 on the Billboard 200 is now #2! The Now 50 album has taken control of the top spot. I think now we can plan on a little bit of a decrease in popularity with the soundtrack but it is still one of the very few albums to do what it did. Can the Now 50 last as long or longer than the Frozen Soundtrack?\n\n[color=white][b]Jay Z And Beyonce Go For A Run[/b][/color]\nThe drunk in love couple went all out on this short film. In preparation for their upcoming \"Part II (On The Run)\" they created a short film with a bunch of well-known actors such as, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, and more. Their upcoming tour is rumored to be all they plan on, so you can exclude plans for a full film. It's refreshing to see such positive activity from the Carters despite the recent issues with Jay Z and Beyonce's sister, Solange.

The album is described as a \"Satirical look at violence in hip-hop and American society overall\" by the lead rapper. Black Thoughts, who is one of the artists in the band went on an interview with XXL and said \"We’re close to being done on it, it’s coming soon, hopefully sometime this Spring. It’s called And Then You Shoot Your Cousin. It’s conceptual; it’s another concept album in the spirit of Undun, but it’s not just about just one kind of character, we create quite a few different characters in this record. It’s satire, but in that satire it’s an analysis of some of the stereotypes perpetuated in not only the hip-hop community, but in the community. I don’t know if that makes any sense.\" \n\n[b][color=white]Track listing[/color][/b]\n[list=1]\n[*]\"Theme From The Middle Of The Night\" (performed by Nina Simone)\n[*]\"Never\" (featuring Patty Crash)\n[*]\"When The People Cheer\" (featuring Greg Porn)\n[*]\"The Devil\" (performed by Mary Lou Williams)\n[*]\"Black Rock\" (featuring Dice Raw)\n[*]\"Understand\" (featuring Dice Raw & Greg Porn)\n[*]\"Dies Irae\" (performed by Michel Chion)\n[*]\"The Coming\" (featuring Mercedes Martinez)\n[*]\"The Dark (Trinity)\" (featuring Dice Raw & Greg Porn)\n[*]\"The Unraveling\" (featuring Raheem DeVaughn)\n[*]\"Tomorrow\" (featuring Raheem DeVaughn)\n[color=white][*][/color]\"Nothing\"  \n[/list]\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]iHeartRadio Music Awards[/b][/color]\nHere are the winners for May 01, 2014 yearly IHeartRadio Music Awards.\n\n[color=white][sp=Winners][/color]\n[hr]\n[hr]\n[b][color=white]HIP HOP/R&B SONG OF THE YEAR[/color][/b]\n[hr]\n[u][color=#E0FFFF]“Pour It Up” Rihanna[/color][/u]\n“Holy Grail” JAY Z feat.
