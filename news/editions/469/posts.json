It would be one of the longest to come in at 23,000 miles and about the same length as the Earth's circumference. It's estimated that the cable would cost around $1 billion. “When completed, this new route will deliver much-needed internet capacity, redundancy, and reliability across Africa, supplement a rapidly increasing demand for capacity in the Middle East, and support further growth of 4G, 5G, and broadband access for hundreds of millions of people,” said in their blog. The cable will be ready by 2024 for the new 16 countries to start accessing the internet much quicker than ever before. Four in ten people in Africa have access to the Internet, while six in ten people worldwide have access to the Internet.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52676253] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Combat Drone[/color][/b]\r\nBoeing unveiled the first unarmed combat drone concept delivered to the Australian Air Force for the first time. The Loyal Wingman can travel with other platforms in place with the Air Force and will be under the influence of Artificial Intelligence. It was the biggest military investment Boeing has made outside the U.S. Loyal Wingman was built using a \"digital twin\" advanced 3D system that allows engineers to test the aircraft before assembly is started. So far, three of these units have been made.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnet.com/news/boeing-loyal-wingman-a-combat-drone-and-historic-aircraft/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Twitter Employees Can Work from Home Forever[/color][/b]\r\nAs States begin their process of re-opening phases, Twitter has announced that they will allow their employees to work at home forever if they choose. Not all staff will be permitted to make this decision, and Twitter has not disclosed to whom it will apply. “If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,” said VP of people. Following this, the corporation cancelled all corporate travel and the opening of offices before the end of the year, which can also be extended to 2021, if necessary. Many big tech firms, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, are allowing their employees to work from home until the end of the year.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/tech/twitter-work-from-home-forever/index.html] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4570721][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/animenews-megane.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World Anime's 1st Promo Video Reveals Cast[/color][/b]\r\nA promotional video for the upcoming anime, \"Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World\" has been released.

Now, this should not be a surprise to anyone, as a majority of animation studios are closing their studios down temporarily. One good news is that the studio will be open and employees will be working on Saturdays.

The anime movie was originally supposed to air in Japan on July 10. At the moment, no new date has been announced. As mentioned in a previous edition, the anime will revolve a new character as well as a new legendary. Koko is a human living in a jungle filled with Pokémon. A reference was made where this story is very similar to the movie George of the Jungle. That being, Koko believes he is a Pokémon himself. He thinks, acts, and moves around like a grass Pokémon would in the jungle. The new mythical Pokémon Zarude is his father. Soon enough, the two will end up meeting our well-known duo Ash and Pikachu who is on an adventure to discover new Pokémon.

Only three members of the four-member group will be performing. Those three being Uki Satake, Sayaka Nishiwaki, and Hirona Murata. They'll be performing from their homes. Included in the performance will be live discussions and merchandise for sale. How the merchandise will be sold is unknown at the moment, but most likely links will be provided for fans to purchase items based on the idol group and have it shipped to their house.\r\n\r\nThe concert will be interesting, that's for sure! For those in the states, if you've been watching live-television or even watching videos on YouTube, you might have stumbled upon celebrities coming together over Zoom calls (or whatever they are using to connect) and singing songs to cheer everyone up. This performance might be something similar to that, but who knows maybe we will be in for a surprise!

BNA will finally be coming to Netflix outside of Japan on June 30. Previously, the only way to watch the anime was illegal as mentioned or if you owned a Japanese Netflix account. The first six episodes aired on March 21 and the remaining six aired on May 6.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around a tanuki (Japanese raccoon dog) named Michiru. Michiru was not always a tanuki, she was once a human. In this anime, there are two cities. A human one, and one where animal-humans take refuge due to the human city not accepting them. This animal-human city is called \"Anima City.\" One day, Michiru runs away from her house and takes refuge in this city. You can hear more about her adventures in Anima City on June 30!
