They have found an exploit that allows them to completely break through the security measures in chat GPT-5.\n\nRed teams from NeuralTrust and SPLX have dealt a major blow to GPT-5’s credibility as an enterprise tool, breaching its safeguards in under 24 hours through layered “storytelling” jailbreaks that bypassed safety filters and coerced the model into producing dangerous instructions. SecurityWeek reports that these findings expose significant vulnerabilities in GPT-5’s architecture, rendering it “nearly unusable for enterprise” without aggressive hardening and continuous monitoring. The incident underscores the growing tension between AI innovation and the operational realities of securing next-generation models against sophisticated adversarial prompts.\n\nThe 2025 cybersecurity landscape is equally volatile, with AI emerging as both a frontline defense and a weaponized threat. Governments in the U.K. and U.S. have announced major funding and guidance to secure critical infrastructure, even as budget cuts to CISA and military cyber units raise concerns about resilience against nation-state attacks. Meanwhile, ransomware gangs are targeting platforms like SharePoint with AI-enhanced tactics, tool sprawl is hampering SecOps efficiency, and firms like Bitdefender are launching advisory services to close security gaps. From Anthropic’s Claude dominating cyber competitions to Microsoft’s autonomous malware detection rollout, Spec Ops teams are adapting with AI-driven SIEM, zero-trust frameworks, and streamlined tooling to keep pace in an increasingly complex threat environment.\n\n[b][url=https://www.securityweek.com/red-teams-breach-gpt-5-with-ease-warn-its-nearly-unusable-for-enterprise/]Source[/url][/b]\n\n[hr]\n\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/user.png[/img]\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=2331053]\n\n[b]\n[size=large]Remember if you have reached an achievement on your account feel free to post about it on our weekly reports thread.

Battlefield 6 peaked at 473,632 concurrent players. This positions it as the fourth most-played game on Steam right now, only behind Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG: Battlegrounds, and ahead of EA's own Apex Legends.\n\n[color=#FF5F54]Battlefield 6 players need to uninstall Valorant due to conflicting Anti-Cheat Software:[/color]\n\nPC players participating in the open beta for Battlefield 6 are being told to uninstall Valorant, as the games have conflicting anti-cheat software. While the EA title is already finding incredible success ahead of its full launch in October, many Battlefield 6 players are frustrated by this requirement, with some even deciding to purchase the game for console instead.\n\n[spoiler][img]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gx81dy3bcAAeLO0?format=png&name=small[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[color=#FF5F54]\"CODified\" Battlefield 6 UI:[/color]\n\nGamers are upset that the BF6 menu is strikingly similar to Call Of Duty. Players all around the world want the old vertical menus back, but as the gaming industry advances so do corporate trends. It might not affect a title's gameplay, but a sleek and user-friendly menu interface is something gamers are extremely passionate about.\n\n[color=#FF5F54]Gamers hoping to get a Switch 2 for the holidays may be in luck:[/color]\n\nSince its June 5 launch, the Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's company history, with over six million units sold as of July 24. Nintendo is ramping up Switch 2 production ahead of the holidays. Due to the Trump administration's tariffs on goods from various countries, Nintendo has increased the price of the original Switch family of consoles and accessories in the US, with the Switch Lite now starting at $229 instead of $199.\n\n[color=#72FF84][b]Game Releases - (August 2025)[/b][/color]\n\n[spoiler][list]\n[*]Wander Stars (PC, Switch) (August 1)\n[*]Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles 2 (Multi-platform) (August 1)\n[*]Hello Kitty Island Adventure (PS5) (August 1)\n[*]Turbo Kid (Switch) (August 1)\n[*]Gradius Origins (PC, Switch) (August 7)\n[*]The House of the Dead 2: Remake (PC, Switch) (August 7)\n[*]Operation Night Strikers (PC) (August 7)\n[*]Ritual of Raven (TBD) (August 7)\n[*]Tiny Bookshop (PC, Switch) (August 7)\n[*]Mafia: The Old Country (PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC) (August 8)\n[*]Echoes of the End (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S) (August 12)\n[*]Ra Ra BOOM (PC, Consoles) (August 12)\n[*]Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II (PC, Xbox Series X|S) (August 12)\n[*]Dorfromantik (PC, Switch) (August 14)\n[*]Drag x Drive (TBD) (August 14)\n[*]Madden NFL 26 (Multi-platform) (August 14)\n[*]Midnight Murder Club (TBD) (August 14)\n[*]Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War Definitive Edition (PC) (August 14)\n[*]Bendy: Lone Wolf (TBD) (August 15)\n[*]OFF (PC) (August 15)\n[*]Delta Force (PC, Consoles) (August 19)\n[*]Sword of the Sea (PC, PS5) (August 19)\n[*]Black Myth: Wukong (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S) (August 20)\n[*]Discounty (PC, Consoles) (August 21)\n[*]Grit & Valor: 1949 (TBD) (August 21)\n[*]The Legend of Heroes trilogy (PS5, Switch, PC) (August 21)\n[*]Ariana: The Books...
