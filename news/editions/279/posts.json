This new recruitment will consist of Four Phases; Phase One is the current recruitment where members will submit their application on the specified recruitment thread // Both Phases Two and Three will be for analyzing the grammar and writing skills of the applicants // Lastly, Phase Four will be where members are actually invited into Writ3rs for a trial test. These members will be placed on the On-Call Team temporarily once invited for said trial test. After two weeks as a trial Writ3r have been completed a decision will be made that will determine whether you keep your spot permanently or if you will be removed from the Writ3rs. If you think you have what it takes to be an official HFNT Writ3r and or would like to read the rest of the recruitment thread kindly make your way to this thread, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5158658]here[/url]!\n\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]PayPal Payments and Upgrades are Temporarily Disabled[/b][/color]\nOn February 13th, 2016 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made an announcement thread stating that as of right now PayPal is no longer an accepted form of payment for both payments and upgrades here on HF. PayPal has unfortunately made alterations to their TOS/AUP which HF supposedly violates. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] does not agree however it has been an ongoing issue with PayPal in regards to fixing these situations. With that reason alone plus [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] having to get his lawyer involved the last time something like this happened he is unsure whether or not he even wants to fix this issue again. Plus the fact that HF adjusted and operated just fine for months when PayPal wasn't an option once before adds more to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] reasoning of not wanting to necessarily jump at the opportunity of getting this fixed. For now HF will operate solely on crypto payments with the majority portion being Bitcoin. Of course this will cause an inconvenience for some members however [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] feels that members should be learning how to use cryptos as a secure online payment method. Though there are downfalls to this change there are also some benefits as well like payments being much more private and the risk of chargebacks and payment disputes are greatly reduced now which of course is excellent news for HF.

How are you doing today? Any shout outs before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] Hi Clique, thank for having me! I'm very well thanks. Huge shout out to everyone in the .NET chat, you guys are awesome.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome, so tell us a little bit of your history of HF. What have you done here so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] Well I joined HF to view a help thread when learning to program. Almost 7 years later, about 3 of which spent lurking, I like to think I've accomplished that. In terms of what I've accomplished onsite, pretty much all the boxes are checked. Upgraded to Ub3r, had a shot at group leader (twice), became a moderator, won MoTM and joined Red Lions.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Quite a journey. What else do you do online? Any hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] Actually that's kind of it for online, I used to do some graphic work - see my owl for example - a few years ago and the odd bit of writing. Hobbies-wise, I kind of hibernate in the winter then return home to Turkey for the summer season and work on a dive boat. Typical hobbies like sports have never really interested me for some reason.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Where do you see yourself five years from now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] I haven't thought that far ahead if I'm honest. Sorry for such a short answer.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url]  That's quite alright. What's your thoughts on the state of groups on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] There's been such a shuffle in recent weeks I can't keep track of what was what. Groups are a great thing if the leadership is stable. But when you do find a group that isn't going to be sold and has genuine, caring members as leaders, it makes it that bit better, gives you the assurance your efforts won't be wasted and inspiring others to do the same. That's my theory anyway.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] What's your name about? Any story behind it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=932616][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] Lots of people ask me this and everyone seems to have a different idea, from some kind of Greek deity to a spin on 'modulus'. It's really just 'sudo' from Linux backwards, I stole the idea from Natas a while ago.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] ADo you think groups have become more or less just a way to flip a profit?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] Absolutely. Aggressive profiting from groups has been around for some time now, but it won't last much longer now that people are growing wise to these tactics, you can see it's becoming less and less profitable and I think the increasing rate of re-brands reflects this. Heavy, even average users will know that a group is only as good as its contributions towards the forum.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] True stuff. What's your honest opinion on riptide?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] It has some pretty big boots to fill given FBN's legacy. But if it can, it'll be a fine group.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FF69B4][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Appreciate your honesty. Thanks for joining us in this week's interview, anything you'd like to say before we finished?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=85546][color=white][b]Odus:[/b][/color][/url] I hope it turns out well. We pretty much covered everything. Thanks for having me, it's been fun!\n[/spoiler][/align][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

In fact, it has now been declared legal by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) for the United Kingdom. This means any intelligence agency within the UK is now allowed to hack into any device without having to worry about coming up against the law - of course, this has not gone un-noticed. GCHQ now struggle with the constant battles between multiple Internet Service Providers and themselves. Previously GCHQ has been able to justify their agencies hacking programs. Agencies have admitted to installing malware on devices, remotely turning on microphones and cameras, tracking locations and stealing documents from their targets. The British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said that \"procedures have been scrutinized by an independent body and been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.\"\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2016/02/63000-social-security-numbers.html][b][color=white]University of Central Florida (UFC) Hacking Leads to Stolen Social Security Numbers[/color][/b][/url]\r\nThe University of Central Florida has revealed a hack that started to surface a month ago. This led to 63,000 Social Security numbers being stolen by a number of online vigilantes. Whilst the investigation is undergoing, the UFC Police have partnered with the FBI \"in an effort to identify other potential victims.\" UFC first noticed this problem in January but is only now spreading the word to their students. This breach in data now means the hackers responsible now have a record of current and prior members (students and staff) of the University of Central Florida dating back to the 80s. UFC has claimed that the \"intrusion\" of personal information has not been attempted to be used to commit identity or financial fraud.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-asks-congress-for-19-billion-to-stop-hacks/][b][color=white]President Obama Wants to Get Serious About Cybersecurity[/color][/b][/url]\r\nObama has approached Congress and has asked for $19 billion to fend of hackers who target individuals, companies and government agencies. Last year, the US Office of Personnel Management was successfully hacked, and data regarding federal employees were stolen. This has undoubtedly influenced the president's decision to approach Congress for $19 billion. Obama has declared that the money will be used to hire cyber security experts and promote hardened security in finance along with updating the government's ancient computer systems. It is believed that this budget proposal represents a shift in spending priorities.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Astute.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dead-at-79-1455404229][b][color=white]US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia Dies at 79[/color][/b][/url]\r\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead at a ranch in Texas on February 13, 2016. An autopsy could not be performed at the time, but officials are presuming that he died of a heart attack induced by old age. Justice Scalia was well known for his staunch position as a \"defender of the Constitution\", interpreting it word for word during a myriad of court cases. In terms of his replacement, one is yet to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

Hours before he entered the prison, he had released a video where he was pleading for the citizens of Israel to remember his legacy, and how he helped Israel in many good ways. Many citizens celebrated over the honesty of their Justice system but simultaneously mourned the loss of an effective and intelligent Prime Minister. Ehud Olmert's abrupt resignation in 2009 paved the way for Benjamin Netanyahu to take control and commandeer the last round of Isreali-Palestinian peace talks. He is currently facing an additional month of prison time for other charges, however, he has submitted an appeal, and is waiting for a response.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/australian-cops-seize-900m-worth-hidden-liquid-meth-article-1.2531725][b][color=white]Australian police seize $900M worth of liquid meth hidden in boxes of imported bra inserts, art supplies[/color][/b][/url]\r\nAustralian police seized over $900 million worth of methamphetamines recently. The drug bust came to fruition after intense co-operation between Australia and China to hunt and shut down multiple massive criminal drug cartels operating between both countries. In the drug bust, four men of Chinese descent were arrested on charges of possession and distribution of an illegal substance. The men were smuggling the drugs by utilizing bra inserts and art supplies among other objects. The magnitude of this drug bust has caused it to be named one of the largest drug busts in Australia's history.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The names of the four newest maps are Alcatraz, Chinatown, Cemetery, and Thin Ice all of which are pretty predictable by their names. Along with the maps, you now have a gun bench to customize primary weapons and uniforms. Both of which you can test at the Gun Range. Finally, there are new Assignments and Legendary Camos. We are unsure of an exact release date in March, however we do know it is in that month. \n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=616118055][b][color=white]Possible Signs of a New CS:GO Operation[/color][/b][/url]\nOperations in CS:GO are without a doubt one of the reasons some people keep playing. It gives them a set of fresh new maps and missions to complete over the course of a few months. Giving the experience of the game a bit of diversity. However, it has been nearly twenty weeks since the last Operation for CS:GO and the community is absolutely furious at Valve for not staying consistent with Operation release dates. However, a sign of hope popped up over the weekend. Six different map makers had been contacted directly by Valve regarding their maps. They had asked the makers to update their maps with anything that may have needed fixing. These maps are Coast, Cruise, Royal, Santorini, Empire, and Tulip. All of these maps are set to be in the Operation coming sooner or later. Now, there does not seem to be any other reason as to why Valve might have contacted these people so we are essentially assuming that is the reason they have been contacted. An exact release date for the Operation is unknown. \n\n[url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-denies-the-division-on-pc-held-back-by-consoles/][b][color=white]Ubisoft Denies That The PC Version of The Division Will Be Held Back By Consoles[/color][/b][/url]\nA couple of weeks ago popular YouTubers Team Epiphany held and interview with one of The Division's developers (who has not been identified). The developer stated that it would be unfair to console players if we had the PC version release earlier. This is theoretically implying that the PC version was set to be held back by consoles. Ubsoft recently made a statement regarding this interview. They then said that what ever their employee said was untrue, and PC will still release at its set release date. Ubisoft is known for ticking people off, so people actually were not too surprised that this would happen. Obviously a sigh of relief for those who are hyping up the game.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Angel.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=left]\n[color=white][url=https://plus.google.com/+GoogleAds/posts/dYSJRrrgNjk][b]Google to Reject All Flash Based Advertisements[/b][/url][/color]\nGoogle announced this week that its Google Display Network and DoubleClick Digital Marketing (DCDM) platforms will now be based solely on HTML5 in order to reach more devices and to offer the best browsing experience. Starting June 30, 2016, AdWords and DoubleClick will no longer accept ads built in Flash to be uploaded, and from Jan. 2nd, 2017, Flash ads will no longer run on either the Google Display Network or through DoubleClick. Google will continue to offer AdWords assistance for advertisers to transition to HTML5. This only applies to static ads, mind you. Flash-based video ads will not be affected at this time.\n\n[color=white][url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338][b]Moore's Law is Finally Being Put to Rest[/b][/url][/color]\nAfter more than 50 years, Moore’s Law, a prediction that has driven technological advances from personal computers to digital cameras and smartphones, is coming to an end. Gordon Moore, an Intel co-founder, made an observation in 1965 that the number of components in integrated circuits was doubling roughly every 12 months. This became known as Moore’s law, which was used by the silicon chip industry as a target to be achieved. Moving forward, rather than cramming more transistors into a microchip and letting device makers build around that, Intel and others will build chips that meet market needs.  \n\n[color=white][url=http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/att-5g-field-testing/][b]AT&T Set to Begin 5G Testing This Year[/b][/url][/color]\n5G is coming, eventually. AT&T has unveiled the groundwork for bringing ultrafast wireless connectivity to the U.S. The company announced Friday that it will start testing 5G wireless connectivity in the first half of 2016 as part of a plan to broadly roll out 5G connectivity across its network in the future. The company stated that the first 5G field tests will take place in Austin, Texas sometime in the second quarter of 2016 through a partnership with Ericsson and Intel, though the company cautioned that widespread connectivity to 5G likely won’t be available for several years. \n[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ariana.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Leadership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2843773][color=#EFEFEF][b]ℭompleχ[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Engima.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2540775][color=#EFEFEF][b]๖ۣۜCyber[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Engima.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#EFEFEF][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Riptide.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1185212][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fiber[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Riptide.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1469364][color=#EFEFEF][b]prada⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Riptide.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1961000][color=#EFEFEF][b]Zexo[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Riptide.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=#EFEFEF][b]illuminati▲[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of The Brotherhood.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1864779][color=#EFEFEF][b]Red Sоx[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of The Brotherhood.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][color=#00AAFF][b]Razor[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a leader of DARK.\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5158658][b]Hack Forums News // Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5170501][b][Official] Engima Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5128494][b][OFFICIAL] Fusion Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5159400][b][Recruitment] Riptide | Create & Record a 16[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5168454][b][Official] Riptide visual sector recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5070037][b][Recruiting] Royalty [Official Group][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5126569][b][Official] The Brotherhood Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Related Buy-ins & Informational Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5152674][b][For Sale] Black Lodge Leadership[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097430][b]DARK - Official Group Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097281][b]Enigma | General Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5172267][b][Official Group] - >> Eternal << - Information - Members - Contributions -[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5127772][b][OFFICIAL] Fusion Official Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4456035][b]Titans | Official Group[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097188][b]The Black Lodge | How to join | Information[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Sales Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5153553][b]DARK Official Group | My group is for sale.[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/SiteNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ariana.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Site Statistics[/b][/color] \n[list][*][sp=[b]Total[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Posts:[/u] 49,793,519 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.19%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Threads:[/u] 3,460,797 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.25%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Members:[/u] 3,040,023 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.27%[/color] )[/list][/sp][/list] [list][*][sp=[b]Average[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Daily Posts:[/u] 13948.85 ( [color=#FF0000]-0.02%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Daily Threads:[/u] 969.49 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.04%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Daily New Members:[/u] 851.61 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.06%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Posts Per Member:[/u] 16.38 ( [color=#FF0000]-0.06%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Replies Per Thread:[/u] 13.39 ( [color=#FF0000]-0.07%[/color] )[/list][/sp][/list] \n[b][color=white]Ban Statistics[/color][/b] \n[list][*][sp=[b]Last Weeks Bans[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Staff Bans:[/u] 119 \n[list][*][i]...
