A press release cited a significant amount of fake content, rumors, and seemingly rebellious content as reasons for the removal. It also pointed to Scratch forums, which contained \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Free Taiwan\" threads that violated local laws and policies. It's unclear how current or potential users of Scratch will be able to leverage similar tools for learning, especially as the school year begins all around the world.

Though the NSA defended the program as being important to the detection and apprehension of terrorist operations, the only example in which they claimed to have material involvement was rejected. The court argued that the NSA's involvement did not contribute to the terrorist's conviction. With the program having allegedly shuttered in 2018, it remains to be seen what will happen to the NSA should more lawsuits follow from this event.

Crave is a streaming application that allows Canadians to view American TV stations, such as HBO, Showtime, and other movies. There is no indication of whether or not the anime will be in English sub or English dub. However, until around the Sailor Moon S, which is the third season in the anime, the English dub stops (As far as Megane knows.) [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-08-28/sailor-moon-anime-streams-in-canada-on-crave-in-september/.163429]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Burn the Witch Anime Trailer Streamed With English Subtitles[/color][/b]\r\nCrunchyroll has confirmed that they will be streaming the upcoming anime \"Burn the Witch\" this coming Fall 2020 anime season. Crunchyroll has uploaded a [url=https://youtu.be/bJzUi09q4q8]video[/url] on their YouTube channel with English subtitles. The anime will take place in London. 72% of London's deaths have been because of dragons; however, what makes it even scarier is that these dragons are invisible to the average eye. Taken from AnimeNewsNetwork:\r\n[quote]\r\nOnly inhabitants of Reverse London who live in the hidden “reverse” side of London can see the dragons. Even then, only a selected few become qualified enough as witches or wizards to make direct contact with them.\r\nThe protagonists of the story are witch duo Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole. They are protection agents for Wing Bind (WB), an organization for dragon conservation and management. Their mission is to protect and manage the dragons within London on behalf of the people.\r\n[/quote]\r\n[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-08-23/burn-the-witch-anime-trailer-streamed-with-english-subtitles/.163220]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Crunchyroll Announces New Membership Tiers With Offline Viewing, Multiple Concurrent Streams[/color][/b]\r\nAn exciting concept that Crunchyroll is trying to achieve. On Aug. 31, Crunchyroll announced that they would be releasing tiered versions of their membership. As of now, those plans are in effect. The United States will be getting four tiers. These being \"Free, Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan.\" Other English speaking countries will not be getting the \"Ultimate Fan\" tier; however, they will be getting the \"Free, Fan, and Mega Fan\" packages.\r\n\r\nThe free tier will remain what it sounds like. You can still watch shows on the service for those who don't know what you get with a free account. However, you get multiple ads during the viewing. Additionally, premium members gain access to private servers, 1080p viewing, and when a new episode is released, they do not have to wait to watch it. Free members do not have access to private servers, meaning they will not get the highest quality when streaming their video, you may have access to 1080p on particular anime, but some shows will only have 360p to 720p. Lastly, when a new episode is released, free members must wait a couple of days to watch it.\r\n\r\nLike the previous \"premium membership,\" the Fan tier is the new name for the premium membership tier. You get everything you would have with that, being no advertisement, watching videos when released, and premium servers. This will cost around $7.99 a month.\r\n\r\nThe next tier is the Mega Fan and will be $9.99 a month. You get everything you would for the Fan tier membership, but you can enable offline viewing for a little extra more, perfect for those long road trips and flights. You can also have four streams at once, which means that you and your buddies can watch different things at the same time without interrupting each other. If you are a subscriber in the United States, you will receive a $15 discount on all $100 or more purchases every three months for the Crunchyroll store.\r\n\r\nThe last tier is the Ultimate Fan, which costs $14.99 a month. Of course, you will gain access to everything in the Fan and Mega Fan tier. However, instead of four streams at once, you can stream six. Instead of the $15 discount, you will get a $25 deal off for $100 or more every three months. The last thing you will get in this tier is a customized \"Swag Bag\" with goodies inside exclusively for this tier.
