If you have never heard of Hack Forum News, dont worry we have you covered. We are a team of members from the Hack Forums community who are journilists and writers, and we are here to keep you in the loop of the changes around the site and now even around the world.[/b]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/headlines.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=121196]\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6302035][color=#ffffff]The Great Purge Day[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nEarlier this week, Omniscient declared \"The Great Purge Day,\" making a bold executive decision to remove a select group of members whom he believes have been damaging his business and driving members away from HackForums. These individuals have been permanently banned, and some have even been completely erased. Omniscient has made it unmistakably clear: cause trouble, and you're out - no exceptions.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6301947][color=#ffffff]Public Convo Closure[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nAfter receiving multiple reports of doxing and harassment in the public conversation room, Omniscient has decided to remove this feature and close the room entirely, stating that the actions of a few have ruined it for the majority. However, Omniscient has mentioned plans to introduce the ability to create private rooms within the conversation feature.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6301729][color=#ffffff]VIP Group Subforums CSS Changes[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nOmniscient has implemented updates to the VIP Group Subforums, giving them a customized CSS design that now reflects the unique name colors of each group. This change enhances the visual appeal of the subforums, making it easier to distinguish between the different VIP groups at a glance.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6301521][color=#ffffff]New L33T & UB3R Userbar Design[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nAs we've highlighted in recent news editions, Omniscient has been implementing various visual changes to give the forum a fresh, updated feel. This week, Omniscient revamped the L33T and UB3R userbars with the assistance of graphic designer Motusora, giving both upgradable user groups a sleek, new look. We think they look fantastic - what do you think? If you're considering upgrading but haven’t already, you can do so here: https://hackforums.net/upgrade.php\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6302095][color=#ffffff]Bytes Reward Adjustment[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nThis week, Omniscient decided to lower the minimum character requirement for posts to just 5. Following this change, Omniscient also determined that it would be more suitable to adjust the byte reward structure. You will now receive 1 byte as a reward for each reply, down from the previous value of 3.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/statistics-header.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=2331053]\r\n\r\n[b]Tables currently don't support centering, but fingers crossed this will be fixed soon.[/b]\r\n\r\n[align=center][table]\r\n[tr][td][b]Dates[/b][/td][td][b]New Posts[/b][/td][td][b]New Threads[/b][/td][td][b]New Members[/b][/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]30.06.2025[/td][td]570[/td][td]76[/td][td]324[/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]01.07.2025[/td][td]594[/td][td]75[/td][td]332[/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]02.07.2025[/td][td]752[/td][td]89[/td][td]303[/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]03.07.2025[/td][td]807[/td][td]110[/td][td]290[/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]04.07.2025[/td][td]852[/td][td]114[/td][td]300[/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]05.07.2025[/td][td]751[/td][td]132[/td][td]301[/td][/tr]\r\n[tr][td]06.07.2025[/td][td]800[/td][td]178[/td][td]291[/td][/tr]\r\n[/table][/align]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/awards-header.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=2331053]\r\n[color=#ffffff]\r\n\r\n[b]This week the donation awards page has had a bit of a change.

The industry's focus remains on software and adoption of Nintendo's new hardware. There are no major console or  hardware releases announced for July 2025 at this time.\r\n\r\n[color=#FF5F54][b]Nintendo Switch 2 restocks:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nScalpers are still a concern for this console a month later. Released on June 5th, the Switch 2 remains in high demand. Best Buy briefly restocked July 1st in-store, and sold out. U.K. retailers (Amazon, Currys, ShopTo) maintain steadier supply.\r\nOfficial pricing: $449 base and $499 bundled with Mario Kart World.\r\n\r\n[color=#72FF84]Notable News (July 2025)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF5F54][b]Call of Duty Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[u][i]Highly Vulnerable: Call of Duty: WWII (PC)[/i][/u]\r\n\r\nWhen the publisher, Activision, was aware of this critical vulnerability, PC servers went completely offline for emergency maintenance.\r\nTimeline of the event:\r\n\r\nJuly 2nd - 4th: This is when the community became aware of the issue. People began posting on Reddit and X warning other users that hackers began opening applications like Notepad and harassing players in-game.\r\nJuly 5th: Activision's official \"Call of Duty Updates\" account acknowledged they were investigating \"an issue\" and took the PC version of the game offline.\r\n\r\nA specific vulnerability \"CVE-2018-20817\" affected several older Call of Duty games as well. Hackers could exploit the game's authentication process, and execute code on your machine remotely.\r\n\r\n[u][i]Historically Vulnerable and Still Considered Unsafe on PC:[/i][/u]\r\n\r\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)\r\nCall of Duty: Black Ops\r\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\r\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II\r\nCall of Duty: Ghosts\r\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\r\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered (on official servers)\r\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III (A patch was released in 2023 by Treyarch.
