The game, made by Riot Games, is a free-to-play video game focusing on the dominion of the opposing team's base, destroying key structures in the process. The members previously in Void have, for now, been invited to remain in the new group as it makes its first steps towards a well respected presence within the community. The well known member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=#EFEFEF][b]Vinnie[/b][/color][/url] has shared his insights in the purpose of the group: [i]\"We're trying to make this group into one of those super active private League of legends communities, so far we have our own TeamSpeak for all of the members to come out and play with other members, we've got a pretty decent directory for the community deep within the sub forum and soon enough we will be hosting private tournaments between Instinct & Nexus within the sub forums, that is why we have the Instinct & Nexus League of legends program, it's not to benefit us but to make the League of Legends community more active, fun and to bring some actual competitiveness to the forum.\".[/i] From those words, the purpose and mindset of the group should be clear to all. For those wishing to join, the information thread located [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4127340][b]here[/b][/url] states that a recruitment will be held in the future, or the option of buying in is available for the set price of $70 for a lifetime spot. Currently, the leaders are [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][b]Hexicidal[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][b]Phenomenal[/b][/url],  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879655][b]iElement[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1189774][b]Bandors[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878647][b]Kosmos[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Gameshark Code: Hyper-Frog[/b][/color] \nMuch controversy has been raised in the past week or so concerning the Hack Forums mentor [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=#EFEFEF][b]Froggy[/b][/color][/url]. Last year, the well known community member received an astounding 1,000 reputation from forum owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, another 9,000 was added to that this month, granting the user an additional 10,000 positive reputation atop that given by members without administrative privileges, bringing [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=#EFEFEF][b]Froggy[/b][/color][/url] to the very top of the leader boards and leaving the controversial member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=63387][color=#EFEFEF][b]Black Shadow's[/b][/color][/url] record in the dust. More surprise followed when all non-positive feedback was removed from the profile and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated in a [url=http://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/445692010838495233]Twitter post[/url] that anyone caught leaving the member negative reputation would receive an instant repfuck, mentioning that an automated plugin is to be expected. Not heeding the warning, several members bit the dust by testing his words, with bitter result. Many threads, since removed, afterwards appeared across the forum with enraged users giving their opinion on the matter. In the end, it may only be a test for the expected upcoming revised reputation system which may or may not nullify existing statuses. Time will give the answer.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/gIeGa1Z.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=215614][color=#00AAFF][b]Androctonus[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 reputation.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1544977][color=#EFEFEF][b]Kreature[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 reputation.

How are ya bud? Any shoutout's you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] I'm good thanks! Yeah, I want to make a shoutout to sobeg, V for Vendetta and Harry Dresden, some of the smartest people I know. I also wanted to give a shoutout to Eeluminati, umad? Didn't even have to ask to get interviewed. :~)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Terrific. So lets talk about the elephant in the room. You've created a thread that has attracted a lot of attention regarding your stance on homosexuals. Do you support homosexuals? Was that thread a troll? It's perfectly fine if you don't of course, everyone's entitled to their own opinion.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] The stance I've presented in the thread is the one that I take in real life. I find it disgusting, but as long as I'm not involved in any way shape or form, I'm happy to let them live their lives. That being said, I also enjoy a good argument, especially with retarded HF members who feel the need to defend human rights, and all that shit. If I'm going to be completely honest, I don't believe in human rights. I don't believe in people who say 'We all deserve equal rights’. The notion might be a good one, but it’s just not going to happen, ever. What really makes me mad are those who sit behind their 4000$ computers typing up paragraphs about human rights and equality while people in Africa, China, Malaysia, hell, even America die on the streets everyday. It might have started as a bit of a troll thread, though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] There you have it folks. Well written if I do say so myself. Moving on, you've recently joined the Writ3rs. What are some of your responsibilities as a Writ3r?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] I was actually approached by Sir 2 days before the News was set to be released, asking if I could write up the World News. Of course, I said yes. I'm basically in charge of keeping up to date with the news, something that I enjoy doing anyway. The Writ3rs are great, they made me feel right at home. It's a tight bunch of people, probably less so than it was before, but nevertheless, it's fantastic to be involved in it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] We're glad to hear you're enjoying yourself. So tell me, if you could change one thing about HF what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] To be honest, there are too many things that I would change. Top of my list would probably have normal members back in the SRPP section. Secondly, I would get rid of all the pretentious Ub3rs who care so much about a few green pixels. Finally, I would get rid of *****, simply because he/she's a bitch.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What exactly is it about HF that keeps you coming back?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] Honestly, I've been on and off HF quite a bit. The only reason I'm back again is because Sir asked me to be a part of the Writ3rs. When I first started out here, I thought the Writ3rs (And Red Lions) were the best groups. Although I can't say anything about Red Lions since I was never in it, I can honestly say that the Writ3rs are the reason that I'm back now. Apart from that, I came back because it's easy to make money here. ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's awesome to hear. Care to expand on your monetizing techniques?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] Not particularly. I've dabbled in quite a few areas. I started out in Social Media, selling Facebook fan pages me and a mate made. After the introduction of all the fake follower shops, I stopped simply because it wasn't profitable anymore. So I moved into RATing. Everything was done for educational purposes of course, and I just used the computers that I owned and infected to attack some of my own servers, and people would pay to see my servers go down. After that, I moved into currency exchange, where I made a killing. I think my total at the time was almost 30k through PayPal, which was ironically registered under a fake name and was never detected. It might not seem like much compared to other exchangers, but just bear in mind I was just over 15, so it was good cash. After that, I went into DDoS services, where people would pay to see me down my own servers again. Now I'm just working in real life, like a normal person. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So what does a regular working' Joe like yourself do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] I'm actually working in a fruit store, doing all the paperwork and occasionally jumping onto registers. It's fun, I don't feel like it's a chore or anything. I'm not working as much as I once did, simply because University is tiring. The pay isn't great, and the people you deal with are retarded, but I've learnt a lot from dealing with people on HF, and everyone has to grow up one day, HF won't be around forever.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahaha, that's an awesome way of putting it. I worked in retail too, so I can relate to that, especially in regards do dealing with the odd retard. Do you have any ideas on what you'd like to do when you're older?  \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] Yeah, I'm currently studying Commerce at the University of Melbourne, and I'm aiming for actuary. I'm pretty sure that 90% of people here won't know what that is, so I'll just quickly elaborate. It's basically very mathematical, calculating insurance policy rates, stuff like that. I honestly don't mind what job it is, as long as I can provide for a family and myself (And I’m not completely miserable). :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Just tell women you work in finance and you're golden. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] Of course, or I could just tell them I play the guitar, I like to watch romantic novels and enjoy long walks in the beach. Personally, I don't think I'll have any problem finding the right one, I've already gone through a few, bound to find the right one someday. Everyone does. So all you loners out there, there's still hope! Go out into the real world, get a job, talk to some REAL people. Get your lives together. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahaha. I'd like to thank you for joining us today Neal. It was a pleasure, do you have any closing statements you'd like to make before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=944024][b]Neal Caffrey:[/b][/url] Yeah, Eeluminati, you're a tool. *****, you're a bitch. Orgy, I love you, have my babies. To everyone reading this, just remember that HF isn't everything. You need to get out and experience life. The more you put that off, the more regret you'll feel when you do step out and realise how wonder life is. And of course I'd like to say thanks to you for choosing me to interview. :)\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Welcome to this weeks edition of the news! We're joined with T3h Hack3r -- owner of Null. How are ya' doing man?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] Thanks for the interview. It's much appreciated. I'm fine. Currently working on Null at the moment. There's quite a bit to be done.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Sounds good man. Glad you're keeping yourself busy! Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] There's quite a few to list. I wouldn't want to miss out anyone. You know who you are \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Awesome, awesome. So. What do you think of the latest group change -- Nexus? Do you play league of legends?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm sure Hexicidal will do a phenomenal *check spelling* job at leading Nexus to the best of his ability. I've had the chance to work with him whilst we were both staff at the time and I wouldn't expect this group to be anything short of perfect. It also adds for some friendly competition between Respawn and Instinct. Yes. I do play League of Legends although it's on the Oceanic Server which is quite limited. If any Hackforums members would like to have a game or two please let me know. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I know quite a few in Nexus that are actually on OCE. Neato. What about Null. How'd that come about?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] Well. The Alliance was for sale. And as I was leader at the time I made an inquiry to obtain it from Paradoxum. The price which was quoted was heavily discounted and myself, Vinnie and Soccer decided to take the opportunity which was presented to us at the time to purchase it. I like to take a unique approach with usergroups and decided to offer a few fields of expertise which aren't presented anywhere else on hackforums. At the moment we are inviting members into the Group as we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforum content. Members should expect to have a high skill cap and specialize within a few fields of interest should they wish to invited.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Unique, indeed. You were previously staff on HF for quite a bit, how'd you like that?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] Well. There's a lot of members that comment saying how hard it is. Whilst that is indeed true. I don't believe it's something which can be commented on with no prior experience. Your drive should be to assist the forum to the best of your ability. If it's anything else. You do not have the correct frame of mind to be staff. Most members here should know that I've been staff twice. The first time was the best, without a doubt. I still recall the time when I was congratulating *shit spelling* Richie at the time over Skype to find out that I also had an invite which I had not read. It's one of my best memories on the forum till this date and I thank Omniscient and the rest of the staff team. The second time was not the best and I do regret accepting the invitation that was presented to me at the time. Looking back I do think that Staff is something that you can only do once. There's a reason that most ex-staff don't return back to the site after they have left the staff team. It's a hard reality.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Thank you for serving HF, man. No doubt! Glad you enjoyed it. Anyways, since you're leader of MRT (trainees). How's that going?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes. MRT is going fine for the moment. I will be honest I haven't been that active with it as I'm studying full time. Although I'll be on break within the next few weeks which I hope to get a lot done. This includes responding to users which need assistance. Paradoxum deserves a shout out here. He is awesome! The current batch of trainees as to which we have at the moment are working hard and I expect them to Graduate the course late this year should all work well. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds good! What are you currently studying? Something is the security department, I'd imagine? Interesting stuff. What do you plan on doing for your break?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] At the moment I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Computer Science. Which will take me three years to complete. Once I'm complete I'll most likely undertake my Masters and PHD. Whilst this isn't within the security field I do work at Mozilla within the security field as a volunteer. My break will consist of hackforums and a lot of assignments/study. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Hope you continue to do well in your studies, T3h. Do you like the direction that Hackforums is going as of now?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] I will be honest, no. Within 2009 members on hackforums were a lot more individuals contributing and willing to assist new members. New members are the backbone of the site. Members here should be a lot more respectful of that. Take for example a thread I saw last night. This individual had a question which was presented within a clear and concise manner. There were no responses offering any direct assistance. Although they told him to \"Google it\". If this was myself within 2009/2010 period I would have been flooded with requests offering me assistance via Teamviewer or MSN which was used at the time. New features here also take a lot of time to implement. I don't think the fact that something that has taken that time can be justified. There are a lot of things here which can be improved. The forum as a whole is not infallible.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I see where you're coming from. Can you picture yourself still being here for the upcoming years?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] Whilst my insight of the forum is different to most. I don't see anything that would justify myself to leave within the next few years. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad you're going to stick around man. Any closing statements before we're finished with the interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=128873]T3h Hack3r[/url]:[/b][/color] Thanks for your time.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Well first, I would like to thank you for having me on here for an interview, it is an honor to be interviewed today. I'd like to give a shout out to Tibit, xadamxk, inxy, Aura, Evangelist, Soccer, 'Snorlax, Compass, Corso, and Renium. They have all been good influences to me during my time on Hack Forums. I'd also like to give a shoutout to all of my fellow noobs in The Empire, Instinct, Complexity, The Brotherhood, Writ3rs, and Polymath.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I noticed that you always have a good collection of userbars, have the groups of Hack Forums had a good impact on you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Groups have always had a good impact on me even before I was invited to my first group. Some of the groups I'm a part of now are some of the one's that have had users I've always looked up to, and a few of those users mentored me and essentially shaped me to be the user that I am today. I wouldn't change the groups I am in now as I have become great friends with many of the members in these groups and I don't have a problem with many members in these groups or many on the site for that matter. The members in these groups strive for excellence and are always helpful and friendly towards others, regular members look up to members in these groups and truly helps shape the site as a whole.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's good to know that they're impacted you in positive ways. So tell me about yourself what do you do outside of the internet?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Outside of the internet I game a lot and I work for an IT Help desk at my school where I also take some classes with the Cisco Networking Academy where I learn how to program and configure switches, routers, hubs, servers and networks. I have been named student of the year three times and hopefully will get the sweep with a fourth one later this year. I am planning on getting my CCNA certification in Routing and Switching later this year and will finally be getting my A+ Certification in two weeks. You can see me helping others troubleshoot their computers and networks in the computing forums from time to time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] You have to answer this for me because I've been wondering this for a while, why did you choose Roger Waters as a username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I chose Roger Waters as a username because I am a HUGE fan of the British band Pink Floyd. For those who do not know who the real Roger Waters is, he played Bass for most of the years the band was together. I made my username his name shortly after a concert of his was announced for my area and I was pretty fuckin' psyched for it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well thanks for clearing that one up for me. Backtracking a little bit here, but what games are you into?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I'm into most pretty much any game for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. I have a decent amount of games that I've collected for numerous systems like the Nintendo Game Cube and the Nintendo 64. I have really been into Dead Rising 3 and Ryse: Son of Rome, some of the other games I've been playing recently are Grand Theft Auto V, NHL 14, Halo 3, and Minecraft/HackerCraft.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice are there any games or titles you are excited about coming out in the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I'm excited for The Elder Scrolls Online, Destiny, and Wolfenstein: The New Order this year. Hopefully some news about the next Halo will be released at E3 this year as well as a few more games to look forward to in the fall.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Those sound like some fun titles. I noticed you played a little Hacker Craft, do you still play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I used to play it a lot before the Green award was replaced by the Purple award. Nowadays I don't really have the time to do it since I am a leader of two sectors in two separate groups and I am overwhelmed with school work. Every now and then I'll pop on to say hello though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice the server could use some more players on it. On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate your overall Hack Forums experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I would rate it a solid 8 out of 10. I've had a great experience on the site with friendly users, easy to use interface, and great groups. There is always room for improvement for the site and would like to see some more features implemented into the site that were announced around a year ago such as 3p1c, the new reputation system, and the mobile application.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm pretty excited about 3p1c as well, if you could change 1 thing about Hack Forums what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I would probably change the fact that you can't buy groups from Omniscient anymore. I don't know why he stopped selling them, he made a good amount of money off someone getting something it takes a little amount of time to get set up. More groups could be set up and their focus could reach more people.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that will wrap up this interview, do you have any closing words for us today?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to thank you, 630, for interviewing me as well as the rest of the Writ3rs for giving me this oppritunity to be interviewed and to be a part of the HF News staff, it has been an amazing thing to be a part of!\n[/spoiler]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

They are now forcing SSL connections. They have switched the connection to HTTPS. While this isn't a big change in terms of actual security, since it has been default for some time, and always existed, it does show us something very important. Google is trying to protect us from the stringent and fathomless reaches of the NSA and other security agencies. This is mainly a promotional campaign to show security-conscious users that Google is there to protect their personal information. Before any of you get too excited though, realize Google will hand out information at the second they are told to by the federal government. Use another service if you want true anonymity. \n\n[color=white][b]Wickr 2.0[/b][/color]\nMany people online use many instant message services to conduct sales, manage businesses, and in general, talk to people. An age old hallmark of the hacking scene is stealing accounts, and with the way technology is so intricately intertwined with business, it is becoming a bigger issue. Not to mention the amount of texts shared on a daily basis, between every day users, and top celebrities. There is no standard of security, but a few months ago Wickr was released. It features fully encrypted texting, no data storage except locally for a limited time, and many other security measures. The chances of you're account being compromised are very, very slim. Though, this got in the way of actual usage and every day problems. So, with some rethinks Wickr 2.0 is now on its way out. Well, in reality it was already past 2.0, but that just shows how fast it truly is growing. Grab a good name while you can. I suggest everyone check it out. \n\n[list][*][url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wickr-self-destructing-secure/id528962154?mt=8][b]Apple Store Link[/b][/url]\n[*][url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mywickr.wickr][b]Google Play Link[/b][/url][/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nPassword management has taken a very large change in the past couple of years. There are constant solutions to the problem of how you can maximize your password's security, but still remember or be able to find it. My advise to you is, less is more, but too little isn't enough. Sounds odd right? Well, if you use a big company like LastPass there are more people trying to hack the server, but if you use a generic site or something you directly control there is a greater chance they will close or you will make a mistake. So, I advise you to either get out the old pen and paper, or use something in the middle.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/RKmUG6A.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Crimean Crisis Costs Russian Moguls Hundreds of Millions[/color][/b]\nRussia's biggest businessmen spent over an hour waiting for reassurances Russian President Vladimir Putin, but got nothing of the sort. After showing up over an hour late to the meeting, Putin spent only minutes with them, offering no reassurances or promises of respite for the companies that could feel serious repercussions from Putin's decision to annex the Crimean Peninsula. The main worries stem from Crimea's value, or rather lack thereof. The only value it really holds to the Russians is national pride, but provides very little in economic terms. This is amplified by foreign trade sanctions, which have been promised to worsen if Russia does not back down from Crimea. The United States has issued asset freezes on several businessmen with close ties to Putin, and investors have pulled approximately $35 Billion dollars out of Russia in the first quarter of 2014. Unless an agreement is reached between the Russia and its partners in trade, or if Russia decides to back away from its annexation of Crimea, the economic situation in Russia could only get worse.\n\n[b][color=white]False Report of Chinese Bitcoin Ban Drives Price Down[/color][/b]\nA false news report published on [i]Sina Weibo[/i], a Chinese microblogging site akin to a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook, has spooked the market into a temporary downward spiral. This now-retracted news report stated that China's central bank, People's Bank of China, released a document that called for all Bitcoin transactions to be halted by April 15th. However, PBOC has since released a clarification statement. \"Regarding the PBOC statement issued on 3/18 requesting all Bitcoin transactions to be halted before 4/15, those close to the regulatory body told Sina Finance on Friday, the PBOC did issue a document, but it was not to ban/halt Bitcoin transactions, instead to strengthen regulatory oversight of Bitcoin transactions, circulation and redemptions.\" While China is restricting how Bitcoin can be used, mainly for financial institutions, it has not banned Bitcoin outright. Peter Pak, the head of trading at BOCI Securities Ltd. conjectured that it may be a preemptive move by Chinese regulators to slow the growth of Bitcoin. \"The scale of the Bitcoin market isn't significant enough to disrupt China’s financial system, but its growth has been very strong. Regulators might be worried that this could get out of control in one to two years if they don’t do something.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Mt. Gox \"Finds\" 200,000 Bitcoins[/color][/b]\nAccording to statements released by the insolvent Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, the company has \"found\" 199,999.99 Bitcoins in an \"old-wallet format\". These revelations were presented at a hearing on March 8th, and recently made known to the general public. A lawyer involved in a class-action suit being brought against Mt. Gox, Chris Dore, is extremely skeptical of Mt. Gox's version of events. \"Their statement that they found [these bitcoins] in a random wallet and failed to tell anyone for two weeks is highly suspect.\" Mt. Gox claims they promptly notified the proper authorities of the discovery, but Dore believes that they may have been attempting to find a way to launder the Bitcoins, despite claims that they simply moved them to their cold storage instead of their \"online wallets\". It's possible that Gox simply \"misplaced\" the $116M worth of Bitcoin, or if Chris Dore's conjecture is true, Gox may have \"Goxed\" their own heist. \n\n[b][color=white]NSA Spying May Be Hurting US Tech Economy[/color][/b]\nThe abhorred, wide-reaching spying programs created by the NSA may be destroying more than users' privacy. The blowback from the revelations of some companies' complacency in the NSA's spying programs has cost massive tech firms customers both domestically and abroad. Microsoft lost some large clients, including the government of Brazil, while IBM is scrambling to build overseas data centers to reassure customers that their data is safe from the pansophical eyes of the NSA. Some users are fleeing to overseas tech firms to try and retain some semblance of privacy, though any data that passes through US servers is at risk of interception by the NSA. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed, perhaps jokingly, or perhaps simply as a spiteful remark towards the organization which reportedly bugged her telephone, that Europe create its own version of the Internet that would never flow through any US servers, thus forcing the data out of the NSA's jurisdiction. However, should the \"Euronet\" ever come to pass, it could have serious economic implications for US tech firms.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/TF7PsyM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Titanfall 2 could be a multi-platform game[/b][/color]\nUnlike the pilot game in the Titanfall series, Titanfall 2 will not be an exclusive to Microsoft platforms. A rumor speculated last week was that Titanfall 2 would be released on multiple platforms, not just Microsoft's platforms. Sources in contact with the gaming website Polygon revealed this week that Electronic Arts have secured the publishing rights to the unannounced game. Electronic Arts declined to comment on this but replied \"[i]We do not comment on rumor or speculation,\" the representative told Polygon. \"Right now all our focus is on supporting all the fans worldwide enjoying Titanfall[/i].\" Titanfall was originally planned to be a Microsoft platform exclusive at its launch, but was later revealed that the deal may be a lifetime exclusive.\n\n[color=white][b]Assassin's Creed: Unity Announced[/b][/color]\nUbisoft announced the next installment in the popular game series Assassin's Creed. The game entitled Assassin's Creed: Unity, sets place in eighteenth century Paris, presumably during the French Revolution. This announcement comes after several leaks and rumors about an Assassin's Creed game setting place in Paris were found and spread across the internet this week. The game is set to be released on the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC in the fall of this year alongside another Assassin's Creed yet to be named for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. A Wii U version of either game has yet to be announced and may not be released.\n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQng7EkJHOI[/yt]\n[/align]\n[color=white][b]Sony Struggling to meet Playstation 4 demand[/b][/color]\nIf you are looking to buy a Playstation 4 anytime soon, you may have to wait a little bit longer. Playstation Head Andrew House spoke with reporters this week at the Global Developer's Conference and stated: “We’re struggling to keep up with demand for U.S. and Europe. Conservatively, as we get into the early summer months, we’ll be closer to a full supply situation.” With that being said, the console may be just as hard to find as it was at launch. As Xbox One sales seem to be catching on, Sony is hopeful that they can produce enough consoles that can stay on shelves before they are sold out everywhere again.\n\n[color=white][b]Playstation 4's Virtual Reality Headset[/b][/color]\nThe future of gaming is here. Sony announced their virtual reality gaming headset this week named \"Project Morpheus\", and is headed to the Playstation 4. The headset consists of two separate pieces: a closed display and what appears to be a Playstation Move built right in. It was announced at GDC last week and is said to be a prototype, and is \"by no means final\". The \nheadset is said to have both an HDMI and USB connection. Some of the specs of this headset are said to be a 1080p display, 90-degree field of view, head tracking, 3-meter working volume with full 360-degree tracking that works with the Playstation move, and can recognize the Playstation Move controller as a virtual object, and supports custom headphones if you prefer to use a different headset for gaming.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of March 23, 2014:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Cut the Rope: Triple Treat - Nintendo 3DS - March 25, 2014\n[*]The Witch and the Hundred Knight - Playstation 3 - March 25, 2014\n[*]Diablo III: Reaper of Souls - PC - March 25, 2014\n[*]Dynasty Warriors 8 Xtreme Legends - Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Playstation Vita - March 25, 2014\n[*]Deception IV Blood Ties - Playstation 3, Playstation Vita - March 25, 2014\n[*]Cabela's Big Game Hunter: Pro Hunts - Playstation 3, Xbox 360 - March 25, 2014\n[*]Putty Squad - Playstation 3, Playstation Vita - March 28, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Upcoming Gaming Events:[/b][/color]\n\n[list]\n[*]None Reported\n\nInterested in having your gaming event posted in here?

That being said, the only really notable survival addition to the game in the last few snapshots had to do with the wolves' aggression to skeletons. Beside that, though; the newer snapshots have mostly just been fixing bugs and implementing command block features for mapmakers. \n\n[b][color=white]TU14 Coming to Consoles![/color][/b]\nIn [url=https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/446661482764591104]a Tweet made by 4JStudios[/url], an announcement was made that Title Update 14 would be coming to Minecraft console editions very soon (after it's done being ran by Microsoft for testing). That being said, they had also included [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1274802-mcxbla-title-update-change-logs-title-update-14/#entry15574882]a link to a large list of changes[/url]. Not only are there plenty of survival additions, upgrades, and fixes; but plenty of bugs and game features have been addressed as well, making the patch very acceptable for what it's been put out to be for the longest time.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nThe HackerCraft sales subforum has been, as anticipated, pretty active and successful. That being said, the main forum for HackerCraft has still kept its activity without the large amount of sales threads and shops. Additionally, regular server activity has presumed, but nothing spectacular has really made too much of an influence.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]Mineplex[/color][/b]\nMineplex has been featured here before and since then has only gotten better. The server offers tons of popular mini-games with a familiar environment and plenty of people to get along with. There truly is something for everyone to play on this server, and there's always room.

In a study published in Stem Cell Reports, Matthew Inlay of the Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center, and faculty member of the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Stanford University colleagues created novel cell assays that identified the earliest arising H.S.C. predecessors based on their ability to generate major blood cell types. This discovery is very beneficial for the creation of H.S.C. lines for clinical treatment and could be a road-map for creating these cells in a dish from pluripotent stem cells.\n\n[b][color=white]Genetic Factor Contributes to Forgetfulness[/color][/b]\nThose who frequently experience cognitive lapses in memory now have an explanation. Psychologists have found a connection between cognitive lapses and the DRD2 gene. Those who have a certain variant of this gene are more prone to cognitive lapses and forgetfulness due to lack of attention. While cognitive lapses are common in most everyone, those with this variant of gene seem to have them much more regularly. Those suffering from this can now find solace in that it is not entire their fault, it is just their genetic makeup. Psychologists recommend writing down notes in order to battle the lack of attention and forgetfulness and improve their life and deficit.\n\n[b][color=white]New Antibiotic Switches On and Off With Light[/color][/b]\nScientists of the K.I.T. and the University of Kiev have created an antibiotic which switches on and off when hit by light. Photoswitchable molecules modify their structure and biological activity when exposed to a light of adequate wavelength. Such photoswitchable molecules are applied in molecular electronics and many other areas. This new antibiotic was created by modifying this building block and turning it into an amino acid analog, which was then incorporated directly in an antibiotic. Its biological activity can then be controlled by visible and U.V. light. This new antibiotic opens up many doors in treating infections, as side effects are significantly reduced.\n\n[b][color=white]Gene Family Linked To Brain Evolution Implicated In Severity of Autism Symptoms[/color][/b]\nThe same gene family that made the human brain into what we know it as today is also linked to the severity of autism disorder severity. The gene family is made up of 270 copies of segments of DNA called DUF1220. DUF1220 codes for protein domain, a specific functionally important segment within a protein. The more copies of DUF1220 subtype a person with autism has, the more severe the symptoms are. Autism Spectrum Disorder occurs when the human brain undergoes significantly increased growth in the first few years of life. This ties in with DUF1220 as the more copies of DUF1220 there are, the larger the brain grows. While having more copies of DUF1220 may be beneficial in certain situations, it can also be very harmful in others. This new discovery puts scientists one step closer to finding a cure for Autism Spectrum Disorder, which affects roughly 1 in 88 children in the United States.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7zlNcBz.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Highly Enriched Uranium[/color][/b]\n58 different nations have gathered in The Hague today to discuss the security of highly enriched uranium (HEU). HEU was, and still is, used to make nuclear bombs, often to the dismay of the civilian casualties they’re aimed at. The two-day conference aims to decrease the use and improve the highly vulnerable civilian stock of HEU. The early draft of the official communiqué states that the intention is to “continue to minimise the use of HEU through the conversion of reactor fuel from HEU to low-enriched uranium, where technically and economically feasible”.  Some believe that America’s budget cut of $220 million could hamper these operations. Talks have been going on behind the scene, as Japan has agreed to release 730 pounds of bomb-ready uranium to the US government, allegedly allowing the US to create between 40 and 50 bombs. \nSince 1993, there have been 16 confirmed cases of HEU theft, most of them from the former Soviet Union. When in the wrong hands, HEU has the capacity to kill millions of people. Take Hiroshima as an example.\n\n[b][color=white]Turkey shoots down Syrian plane[/color][/b]\nA Syrian plane allegedly invaded the Turkish airspace and was shot down by F-16s. Syria has stated that the plane was attacking Syrian rebel forces inside of Syrian borders, and claims that their actions were ‘blatantly aggressive’. According to the Syrian Observation for Human Rights, the plane came down on the Syrian border. This contradicts Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip’s comments that “Our F-16s took off and hit this plane. Why? Because if you violate my air space, our slap after this will be hard.” \nTurkey was once a supporter of Syria, and now is one of the main supporters of the opposition rebel forces, attempting to remove the now president from power.  \n\n[b][color=white]Curing Homosexuality[/color][/b]\nDr. Christian Jessen has gone undercover for a documentary about curing homosexuality. Dr. Jessen was placed in a room with pictures of naked men and basically made to vomit, while a tape continuously repeated that he was “worthless,” and that being gay was “evil.” This treatment was developed in the 1920’s in an attempt to get rid of homosexuals all together. It was thought that after undergoing the treatment, homosexual thoughts would trigger physical responses such as vomiting, thus discouraging homosexual thoughts. Jessen also collaborated with John Smid, who was living as a married man for years until he came out as gay. Smid, who used to run his own gay-curing centre, shut it down after coming out as gay and retired. Jessen hopes that this documentary will help raise awareness for homosexuals and encourage more to come out. \n\n[b][color=white]Baby ‘ejected’ from mum’s womb[/color][/b]\nMany are puzzled as to how this baby came into the world. Mao Zhau was taking his wife Wang Zhau to hospital while she was in labour when their bike was hit by a truck in Xiamen. Witnesses claim that the baby, who was perfectly healthy, was ‘ejected’ from the womb with the impact of the collision. Following the crash, the newborn was found at the side of the road with minor injuries. There has been no word as to what will happen to the baby, who has already received numerous donations and gifts. Stories like this remind us how precious life is, and that we should cherish it.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/qIhVVNQ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Rhapsody And Napster To Leave Echo Nest In Result Of Spotify Takeover[/b][/color]\nRhapsody and Napster aren't the first to leave Echo Nest after Spotify's takeover of the company, seeing as Rdio has left as well. The companies which are one in the same are leaving in the coming months, but not in a defensive way. Rhapsody claims the leaving of Echo Nest is more of a chance to stand. Rhapsody has said they have never been completely satisfied with leaning against Echo Nest for personalization. They are expected to develop their own way to add personalization after they leave.\n\n[color=white][b]TWC Issues First Transparency Report[/b][/color]\nFollowing the release of many other companies' transparency reports, Time Warner Cable have released their own to the world as to not be outdone. The report ranges from January to June of 2013 and it shows the company had obeyed around 12,000 information requests from the government. They break it down as 82 percent for subpoenas, 12 percent for court orders, 4 percent related to search warrants. On their information disclosure, 77 percent of the data was subscriber information or transactional data, 20 percent of the time they shared no data and 3 percent of the time, content information was the data released. While this isn't really as specific as we have wanted, it is a step in the right direction.\n\n[color=white][b]LG Smart Bulb Flashes When You Get Calls[/b][/color]\nLG has just unveiled the Smart Lamp, its first take on the connected lighting market. LG's bulb is 10W and is LED, which gives Android and iOS users control over their lighting, much like Philips is doing. The bulb includes a light-based alarm clock, and a security mode that acts as though you are home, to possibly ward off invaders. The bulb is connected via Bluetooth and WiFi, and could do numerous sync-based things. These include flashing when you get a call, or pulsing to the beat of music. The bulb is currently released in Korea, and runs about 35,000 won or around $32 USD. There is no word on whether or not it is coming to the US. \n\n[color=white][b]Google's Image Format Makes YouTube Pages Load About 10 Percent Faster[/b][/color]\nGoogle is aiming to make the internet a little faster, with their lightweight WebP image format. The format is now being put into use on YouTube thumbnails, to make the pages and videos load 10 percent faster than what it usually does. According to Google, overall the image format has shaved off tens of terabytes of its internal data transfer rates. They also claim that it should help lower bandwidth usage for users as it continues to roll out. We have seen the formatting already in use on Google Play for some time now, and they are hoping to keep improving this image format.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/eXQx0Yx.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]The NFL is trying to make MIA pay over $16 million.[/color][/b]\nThe NFL wants over $16 million from MIA for sticking her middle finger up on TV two years ago during the Super Bowl. The NFL wants restitution as well as $1.5 million in arbitration for flipping the bird during the 2012 Super Bowl Half-time Show. This figure is based off of what advertisers such as Samsung, among other companies, would have paid for ads during the two minute period MIA performed, plus the estimated value of exposure she got from appearing in Madonna's show. \n\nMIA and her legal team have responded by filing papers that undermine the NFL's position. Stating that their claim lacks any \"law, fact, or logic.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Lollapalooza Headliners Still Unknown[/color][/b]\nNews has been scarce about Chicago's very own Lollapalooza, even though tickets are going on sale next Tuesday. Coachella and Bonnaroo have already announced their top headliners. The Chicago Tribune reports that the headliners would include Skrillex, Eminem, Kings of Leon, and Arctic Monkeys; this being said, these are simply rumors. We will have to wait for Lollapalooza to announce it themselves to make it official. \n\n[b][color=white]Newly Released Songs This Week[/color][/b]\n50 Cent came out of the shadows with a new track with an inspired 80s vibe called [i][url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyJk0SwqKj8&list=TLCMvUAKYhlUEPrA9eyEksLpbMcPsSix2X]Hold On[/url][/i], and JT released [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjty080jy60&list=TLhOsGY2M02C61-j1wpJU-aVH_WN-Y904z][i]this[/i][/url] a few days back.

Back in October, it was reported that Twitter's relatively new #music app would be shutting down; well, it's happening now. The app at first was a huge success but has taken a dive in the downloads rankings. The app's founder, Kevin Thau, reportedly resigned from the company one week after it launched.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

Omniscient can be very \nmysterious sometimes, but to completely 'ruin' the system adding a \nbonus of 10,000 reputation to a member, which is more then likely, \nmore then 1/10th of all the reputation in the circulation is quite \nridiculous. Even more so, the new so called 'rule' about adding \nnegative reputation to her. I created a large thread about the \nmatter, and many users had the same thoughts, it just was not \nright. Until positive stepped in and closed the thread 🤫. \nMany members added negative reputation to her and I don't believe \nconsequences has come to them yet, and we have heard no more \nnews about the so called 'rule'.

This completely \ntakes the purpose of \"Earning\" rep and then shoving up your \nasshole and leaving it there to rot in your asshole for 2 years and \nthen shitting it out and then smearing it all over your face. It may \nseem pretty fucked up but true. She doesn't deserve special \ntreatment because it isn't fair on the other members who work \nto gain rep. If she is getting special treatment then...

I see members stating other \nopinions such as \"Why is froggy getting SUCH extra attention?\" Do \nthe rest of the HackForums members feel left out? I see that Froggy \nis loved over Hf.
