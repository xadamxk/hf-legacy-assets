In OMC to USD, that is roughly around $26-$28 at current rates. Long story short, the award price has been raised. The increase comes to play because it brings some more value to the coin, according to Omni. Additionally, the LTC award price has been raised to 4 LTC. Both hikes are too ensure that no awards will be lower than $20.[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] states that \"There is currently over 4 million OMC in circulation. That's a ton imho. Unsure how 30% of all OMC has been already mined but it has. It's going to be hard to stabilize the value when OMC is hardly rare at all. There are members who are probably holding hundreds of thousands of OMC.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Important Information about Scammer Reputation[/color][/b]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a  [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4386890]thread[/url] which states that you are required to leave a link in someone's reputation should you accuse them of scamming.

Around 10 members, possibly more, have been banned and Repfucked for posting and then deleting their posts within the marketplace.

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], owner of Hack Forums recently celebrated his 44th birthday. Many members sent him gifts from his Amazon wishlist which, at the time, was displayed in his signature for at least a month prior. At this moment in time, HF is 7 years old! It's honestly amazing how [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] puts in all the effort he currently does for the community considering how busy he is behind the scenes. Many members have been on this site since its conception, and stayed until now. As Omni stated on his thread, \"HF continues to move forward and while I'm getting older many of you are simply growing up and becoming adults. HF is now over 7 years old. Members who joined in their teens are now in college, having their own children, and working toward careers. It's pretty cool imho. I get lots of great feedback on how HF has changed lives. It's also changed mine and I don't ever forget that. I'm very blessed to have this community. Through each days struggle I learn to be a better person. Thank you, thank you all.\" Once again, Happy Birthday Omni!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/v8gZ52q.png[/img]\n\nOur Podcast shall be back for 206 and better than

Most of the new altcoins incorporate proof-of-stake in some way, those who don't seem to be stillborn. Is this a sign that we should change too, before it's too late? Making the switch to proof-of-stake would radically change the direction of the coin. First and foremost, no more coins can be generated. This would prevent inflation and help reducing the currently abundant supply. On the other hand, the switch would render miners useless, potentially leaving the mining users in the red.

This week we're joined with an HF veteran, Wafflemonger. Any shoutouts to start this interview off?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color] Shoutout to the MRT team, even though I'm only a recruit, the work they do on the forum is invaluable and cannot really be replaced.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Just curious, how long have you been affiliated with with the MRT?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color] I don't remember the exact date, but it was definitely a year and a half or more.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Did you have an interest in malware removal and computer security before you signed up on the forum?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes I have actually. My whole interest actually started when I was 14 years old, so about 8 years ago. I had no idea that Hackforums even existed back then.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What's your backstory on how you discovered this board, anyways? How different was it back in 2008?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color]  I actually discovered this forum through looking up how to phish believe it or not. I lurked for over a year barely making any posts. Back in 2008, Crow essentially led the forum and it was pretty heavy on blackhat material. So I discovered the forum purely due to blackhat reasons.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What's your opinion on the news team? Do you actually read through the articles that we put up?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color]  Truth be told, sometimes. I generally only read through them when it has something that applies to me. However a long time ago I created a malware removal guide for The Alliance. I had submitted this guide to be mentioned in the news article, but I didn't see it in that specific edition so I stopped looking for it. Then about 2 months later, I searched my name on Hackforums for the hell of it and saw that my guide was actually listed in a future news edition. Also, I like reading about people that get banned. That's a pretty cool section XD.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Could you say that Hackforums is going in the right direction?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color] Well a lot of the sections in HF don't really apply to me. I mean I've never purchased a single item from hackforums and I really don't plan to, so that cuts off at least half the forum. The part of Hackforums that I do frequent generally has a more mature attitude, like the Innuendo section, White Hat Help section, etc. So yes, I would say that based off of what I partake in, Hackforums is going in the right direction.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Could you see yourself still browsing this site years from now?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color]  It all depends on what happens after I graduate. I have no idea where my life will be headed so I cannot really comment on something so uncertain. However, I can say that I personally wouldn't have a problem with it as I am currently learning the ins and outs of malware removal from the MRT team, so I hope that I can apply that knowledge to better assist other users on the forum.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Wise words. Any tips for someone whose looking to get into the whole world of malware removal/computer security?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b] Well, the first place someone that is totally new to malware removal can start is guides. How I learned is through actually reading solutions to other people's problems on another site (Geekstogo). However before any of that, a person should learn how the computer itself works. There's really no way to begin removing malware if you have no idea what's supposed to be there in the first place. The next step would be to learn how malware itself works. You can't really defend from something or remove something when you have no idea how that something will be attacking the system.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interesting stuff. Anything you can tell us about yourself?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color] I am a 22 year old currently attending college to achieve a Bachelors of Informatics and Security (Computer Security). I am in my final year of it so that means I'll be graduating next year. I currently hold a job with the Canadian Bankers Association as a Help Desk Analyst (Tier 2 tech support). I generally enjoy playing games like League of Legends, WildStar or any other single player RPG game. When I am not doing any of that I talk to my girlfriend. Yes, she's real XD.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Best of luck with your studies and thanks for doing this interview with me! Any final words?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=8383]Wafflemonger[/url]:[/b][/color] Looking forward to play a league game with you considering we are in the same division.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600]Fox™[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 205th edition of the HF News, today we're here with Fox™. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] Hey, thanks! Glad to be here. I'll mention Ty ™, Anima., Renium, Harlem, emotion, Unite, Aura, BlueTiger, 1n9i9c7om, 'Snorlax, bugga, Eternal, iKinky, 'Sin, Tibit, and all of The Empire.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] All the empire guys and gals. I see you always rocking the userbar, how did you weasel your way in and how do you like the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] It's quite funny how I got in. I was chatting with Eternal and had a laugh about it later. To keep it short, I applied during the December recruitment of 2013, and I was denied. I shot Tibit a PM asking if I could have a re-review, and he had me PM Eternal. Eternal denied me a second time, and then shortly after I made a statement that said, \";c Oh well, there's always next time. Thanks.\" he told me that he didn't know why, but he felt like he thought I'd be a good fit for the group. To this day, I fully agree with that statement. It's my favorite group out of the 9 I've been in since I joined HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's good to hear, I'm definitely enjoying my second time in the group. So what makes the group stand out from the others you've been in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] To put it into words, business is booming on the inside. It's the most active group, and I've never been in one that feels so much like a family. It's so tight-knit, we all know each other, and we all can have a good laugh together. I can personally say that I have made friends within the group. As well, being a small group, it's easier to get to know everyone. I'm pretty sure all of The Empire has me on Skype, or close to all.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I don't and I'm never adding you, GL finding my anonymous ass. So I just noticed you are a Writ3r, what do you do to help out the crew?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] I'm pretty sure I have you though.  I've only been in for two editions, but I do Film news. I've not been in long, but I like it a lot. It's definitely something I intend to stick around and continue, and hopefully make my way up the hierarchy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Shhh, don't mention the system, Roger Waters might get mad. So what do you do outside of the forums? Where are you from?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] Outside of the forum, I'm an average guy, currently attending High School. I reside in the state of Kentucky. I do a lot of Photography, and enjoy some activities like band what not. I'm a part of the school's official \"Help Desk\" where we go around servicing computers. It's an easy class, and I'm looking forward to it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What do you have planned for the future? Plan on going to school or having anything exciting you want to do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] I plan on going to a college nearby, and I think I'd like to go into an IT, Engineering, or Educational position. I love Technology, and art, so I feel like I can look forwards to a lot of opportunities in the future. One thing I've got to look forward to is my graduation gift at the end of High School. I'll be traveling Europe a little after I graduate. Pumped about that. Other than that, I don't have a ton of plans for the future quite yet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Why Europe of all places? What are you going to do over there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] I've already been to a lot of the United States, and have been to Canada, but I find Europe to be a cool place. I've never been to Germany, or England. I've got friends in both Germany and England, so I may see some of them for the first time face-to-face. Additionally, my family is strongly German. I also would like to go to Australia, because, on my mom's side of the family, I have a lot of Australian heritage, and I have a lot of direct family over there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Time to switch things up a bit here, how do you feel about OMC, 3p1c, and the award? Do you have the OMC fever?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] I do not, no. I bought into it when I wanted 3p1c and then Ty ™ gave me OMC to buy the award, but I don't do any mining or anything. I just don't have the extra time to speculate. I also lost my wallet (had ~130 OMC) when my hard drive failed 6/29/14. (a day later, and I would've blamed you for it xD) Since then, I've just not been bothered to get any more. I do however support the coin and the use of it, and I'm excited to see it implemented in many more ways.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I liked OMC, but the fact that it's dying is depressing. So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] I would agree. It's a nice concept. Anyway, I joined HackForums because a friend of mine (AnxZiety) suggested I join it. I did, and since then, I've not regretted a second of it. The community, and diversity caused me to stay.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could change one thing on site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] I can't think of anything. I'm not sure if I'm not creative, or if I just like it how it is. If I had to change something, maybe I'd add a rank after Ub3r. Some new features could be pretty cool.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] New features would be nice. How would you rate your overall experience on a scale of 1-10?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] A solid 9/10. I've never been on a site that I was active like on here. I won't lie, the first time my father saw the logo of the site on my monitor, his look was priceless. I guess the name \"Hack Forums\" doesn't flow with everyone too well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's all the time I have for this interview. Thanks for taking the time to be interviewed. Are there any final remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fox™[/b][/color][/url] Hey, thanks! That's it.[/spoiler]",

A link to a download of a malicious file is sent with the headline [i]\"ROBIN WILLIAMS SAYS GOODBYE WITH HIS VIDEO PHONE\"[/i]. The intent was to lure unsuspecting social media users to a malicious website. This social engineering tactic has been used before and has proven quite successful. The merciless, abhorrent hackers who use this as an attack vector, however, are continuing to do so. Once lured to the site, you are expected to either fill out a survey or download a \"Facebook Media Plugin\" in order to view the video. All though it would be incredible to hear the final words of the comedy legend, do not assume that any links are true.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Anonymous Hackers Threaten Ferguson Police Department[/color][/b]\r\nAs many of you are aware, the tragic murder of an unarmed 17-year old boy named Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer has drawn the attention of the nation at large. The infamous hacker collective \"Anonymous\" has decided to take action if need be. They are demanding that legislation be enforced pertaining to the humane treatment of citizens by law enforcement officers. Their promise is that if sufficient action is not performed soon, they will leak private and highly sensitive information on every member of the Ferguson Police Department as well as stealing databases, e-mails, and other private data. These groups of hackers' no-holds-barred mentality is rather severe, but they justify their actions by claiming it is for the greater good of society.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]All-Seeing Satellite[/color][/b]\r\nA relatively-new program called the \"Worldview 3\" project was finally put into fruition when a satellite was launched into orbit on Tuesday August 12th, 2014. A USA-based company, DigiGlobe, developed the camera for this project and it is so powerful that it will be able to see your face from orbit. Surely only law enforcement and protective agencies will have access to this, right? Companies such as Google, NASA, Microsoft, FBI, NSA, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency will all have access to this satellite. This is a completely new and invasive spying tactic set in place by the government and national conglomerate businesses.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Gm7w7ET.png[/img][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=255459]Delirium™[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]New Google Chrome Version Fixes 12 Vulnerabilities[/color][/b]\r\nGoogle has released its new Google Chrome update which includes a fix for 12 different vulnerabilities. Those bugs where found by independent security researchers who reported them using the Bug Bounty program of Google and by doing so, received their rewards. For a use-after-free bug found on Chrome's web sockets part (CVE-2014-3165), a researcher has been awarded 1,500 Euros. Another researcher has received money for finding a serious bug involving the SPDY protocol. To fix the SPDY protocol bug, Google Chrome programmers decided to turn off SPDY and QUIC session pooling in their latest release.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Anonymous Hacked The Ferguson Police Website[/color][/b]\r\nAfter the shooting of a 18-year-old boy named Michael Brown, Anonymous, a hacktivist group, hacked into the Ferguson Police website in order to collect information about the incident. Anonymous posted on Twitter a large amount of found information and uploaded videos regarding the shooting on YouTube. Michael Brown, an unarmed man, has been shot multiple times by a police officer and had his dead body left on the street for many hours. Henceforth, Ferguson police has been accused of racist attacks and assaults.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Vunlerability On BlackBerry's Wi-Fi File Sharing Feature[/color][/b]\r\nA team of security researchers of the Mozhero company have found a serious vulnerability on BlackBerry's wi-fi file sharing feature. According to the report, a malicious user can get access to the file system of the phone by exploiting the aforementioned vulnerability. In order to gain access to the file system, an attacker must connect to the file sharing service of a vulnerable BlackBerry phone, which, according to the company, is disabled by default. This means that the attacker must convince the victim to enable it. According to BlackBerry, however, the BlackBerry OS version 10.2.1.1925 is not vulnerable to the bug.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/TvznEMg.png[/img][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]AMD is Gearing Up to Enter the SSD Business[/color][/b]\r\nAMD is in the business of a lot of things already: processors, graphics cards, and really almost all computer related components; it's hard to believe they haven't gotten into SSDs already. This is all about to change very soon seeing as AMD is looking to get into making SSDs. The company will be bringing the SSD line to the market under the branding of Radeon R7, which is a pretty renowned thing at this point. The SSDs will be geared towards gamers and be available in 120GB, 240GB, and 480GB versions. The read and write speeds seem to be up there with similar SSDs from companies such as Samsung. This is really all we know about specs until the SSDs launch later this year.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Smartwatch Pioneers Meta Come Back With a High-End Alternative to Pebble[/color][/b]\r\nPebble wasn't really known for much until it made the smartwatch that became almost a household name overnight. Pebble wasn't always this well known, though. Back when Pebble was first starting and only had a BlackBerry accessory, the biggest brand of technology wearables was MetaWatch, which was a company based out of Fossil. They remained relatively quiet up until recently when they revealed the Meta M1. The M1 was designed by Nokia and Vertu legend Frank Nuovo, who happens to design crazy-expensive devices. The M1 is launching next month and pre-orders are live as of now. The devices was revealed originally at CES and was pretty barebones, but now it has a wide variety of cases and straps for the users. The base model, a natural black watch will cost you $250, while a stainless steel version is available for $450.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Twitch CEO Apologizes For New Policies, Makes Improvements[/color][/b]\r\nWhen Twitch announced and rolled out its new policy updates, it made a lot of people angry. The main thing people were upset about was the muting of unlicensed music in stream. This means if Twitch figures out that your stream has unlicensed music, it will mute the audio for about 30 minutes. The CEO of Twitch went on Reddit in the form of an AMA to state that it will not affect live broadcasts. So while you're driving through the streets of San Andreas listening to the radio, you're fine in the live broadcast, but it will be muted when it gets archived. This does bring worries for games like Rock Band or any music based game really. Most of what was discussed in the AMA was the music issue, although he did discuss the shut down of the general streaming site, Justin.tv. As an update to what was discussed in the AMA, Twitch posted a blog detailing new changes to policies which include maximum time-limits for highlights being gone, and adding an appeal button for videos flagged with violations.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/HeflzKQ.png[/img][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1030620]CyborgIzSoBeast[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]GameStop Now Fingerprinting People Trading in Games[/color][/b]\r\nSome GameStop stores in Philadelphia are now requiring that people who trade in games provide a fingerprint scan for \"certain transactions,\" CBS Philadelphia reports today based on conversations with the retailer, local government, police, and shoppers. According to GameStop, it is following a local law that says the retailer is allowed to collect thumbprints. These scans eventually make their way into a database that helps law enforcement nab thieves who seek to use GameStop as a pawn shop of sorts to unload their goods. Philadelphia city solicitor Shelley Smith says that GameStop is not required to collect the thumbprints to abide by the city's pawnbroker order. \"What GameStop does doesn't meet any of the elements of the definition in the code, so the pawnbreaker ordinance doesn't apply to GameStop,\" she said. The Philadelphia Police Department, on the other hand, tells CBS Philadelphia that GameStop is being proactive by obtaining customer fingerprints and uploading them to a database known as LeadsOnline. Still, GameStop shoppers outside of a store in Philadelphia's Center City district are not too pleased about the new policy. \"I really don't appreciate it,\" one person said. \"You fingerprinted me like I'm in a police district. No, I'm at a game store.\" Another shopper said, \"I think it's an overreach. It's going too far.\"\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Battlefield 4 Glitch Gives You Unlimited Rockets by Combining Two Classes' Gadgets[/color][/b]\r\nAlong with dictating what weapons you're allowed to use, Battlefield 4's class system restricts what gadgets you can have at your disposal. This helps to define what the function of a given class is (the Engineer is a good anti-vehicle class, for example) and prevents you from being able to have certain combinations of tools--say, a rocket launcher and an ammo box to provide yourself with additional rockets. Thanks to a new glitch, this is no longer the case. As documented by YouTube user EvilBeastLord (via BF4 Central), this bug allows you to effectively combine two classes. What this means in effect is that you can gain access to gadgets that one player could otherwise not have, like the aforementioned rocket launcher and ammo box combo (combining the Engineer and Support classes), or a revive kit and anti-tank mines (Assault and Engineer). The process for doing this is relatively straightforward, though it's also something you're very unlikely to have ever done by mistake. You simply set opposing item slots to have \"no gadget\" and then hit the L1 and R1 or Left Bumper and Right Bumper as you hit the button to spawn, and that empty gadget slot will be filled by the corresponding slot's gadget from the other class. This glitch isn't necessarily game-breaking in the way others have been; provided you have at least one competent teammate, it's not uncommon to wield a rocket launcher while a teammate's ammo box provides you with additional rockets.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Galactic Civilizations Developer Hires the Guy Who Built Battle.net[/color][/b]\r\nStardock, the developer of Sins of a Solar Empire and the Galactic Civilizations series, has announced its hire of Adrian Luff, the man responsible for overseeing the growth of Battle.net during his 17-year tenure at Blizzard Entertainment. Luff joins Stardock to lead the roll-out of Project Tachyon, an initiative which will \"manage the online infrastructure to provide the meta-game experience\" for the company's multiplayer games. The project will run entirely on the cloud and utilize Valve's Steamworks \"where possible\" on the PC. According to Stardock, Project Tachyon will use each platform's \"inherent features,\" allowing players to utilize new features in Stardock games including integrated ladders and matchmaking. Stardock is currently developing Galactic Civilizations III, a turn-based strategy title for PC. The game will use Project Tachyon in at least \"some capacity.\"\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Petition created to Memorialize Robin Williams in Legend of Zelda[/color][/b]\r\nA petition was created this week in an effort to memorialize Robin Williams after his tragic passing earlier this week.

Ubisoft released a statement ruling out any development for Next-Gen consoles at this point, but did not rule out a possibility that the games could be ported to these consoles. The statement says: ”It’s too early to discuss this subject. Right now Unity is our game for new generation consoles.\" Assassin's Creed: Rogue is expected to be the gap in between Assassin’s Creed III and Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and takes place in the 18th century during the Seven years war. Assassin’s Creed: Rogue is set to release on November 11 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]September Xbox One Update[/color][/b]\r\nThis week as Gamescom, Microsoft announced the next update coming to the Xbox One. Releasing in the coming months, the updates are expected to overhaul social features, entertainment features, and media applications. The most notable features coming to the Xbox One are an all-new media app that will allow users to stream media files from a USB-connected device or a Network device that supports DNLA protocols. Another feature is the ability to stream TV to tablets via Xbox's Smart Glass app, and the ability to boot your Xbox One directly to the television app after coming out of standby mode. A list of changes that will be made are listed below, a majority of them will be released in September.\r\n     \r\n[sp=New Changes]Parties – The Party App has been re-organized, so you can now see what activities everyone in your party is doing and tell more clearly who is playing in the same game with you.  You can also more quickly perform common actions like muting, joining, or sending game invites.  Also, Parties now have a Party Leader.  This person can change whether the party requires invitations, and she/he can remove others from the party.\r\n     \r\nNew Friends Section – The new Friends section has been available for a few early access preview members and we’re expanding it to additional participants enrolled in the preview program. The new Friends section enables you to see at a glance what’s going on with your friends. You can stay up-to-date with your current activities, the most popular games your friends are playing, and a Gamerscore leaderboard to see who has improved their Gamerscore the most over the last 30 days. We’ll continue to roll this feature out to all participants in the coming updates.\r\n     \r\nMedia Player – A new app will be available soon that enables you to play media files from either an attached USB device or from a network connected home media server that supports DLNA protocols. The preview version of the Media Player app will initially only support USB devices, with DLNA support coming soon. Xbox One will support more formats than Xbox 360, including support for dozens of new file formats like mpeg 2 TS, animated gifs and mkv which will be added by the end of the year. See below for additional file formats.\r\n     \r\nXbox One Digital TV Tuner – Announced last week, this new hardware accessory will enter a limited preview program in Europe (UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), in advance of its retail launch beginning in October.\r\n     \r\nStream TV to SmartGlass – Launching first in markets receiving the Xbox One Digital TV Tuner, you will be able to stream your TV across your home network to your smartphones and tablets using the Xbox SmartGlass app. You can also pause, play and rewind as well as change channels, without interrupting gameplay on Xbox One.\r\n     \r\nBoot to TV – Now you will be able to set your console to boot directly to television when coming out of connected standby.\r\n     \r\nLive TV Miniguide – For markets where OneGuide is available, a new mini guide on the bottom of the screen will display details about the TV content that is currently playing. You can quickly change channels and see what’s on other channels, while still watching TV.\r\n     \r\nSmartGlass Updates – You can now post status messages from the Activity Feed as well as add comments and share items from both your Activity Feed and from Game Clips. Along with the new comment and share features, a personalized Activity Feed has been added to your profile. Messages have been updated to a new layout supporting a full conversation view. Additionally, we are adding the ability to record game clips directly from the Now Playing bar. Finally, if you upgrade the app directly we have introduced a What’s New page highlighting the features of each release.\r\n     \r\n“Xbox On” in New Markets – Adding support for additional markets to use the “Xbox On” Kinect voice command to power on consoles: Australia, Canada (French), Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil – a top used feature.\r\n     \r\nCountry Expansion – We’re doing a lot of work on the backend to prepare for Xbox One to launch in 29 new markets in the coming weeks.\r\n     \r\nMultiple Game DVR Deletes – You will be able to choose multiple GameDVR clips to delete at once in the Upload app.\r\n     \r\nSave your Avatar Gamerpic – A new option is now available to save Avatar GamerPics to your OneDrive.\r\n     \r\nSettings Updates – New options help you manage your controllers and accessories.

This is useful if you want to track against bandwidth caps set by ISPs in certain markets.[/sp]\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of August 8, 2014:[/color][/b]\r\n[list][*]Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed -  Play Station 3, Play Station Vita - August 12, 2014\r\n[*]Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited -  Play Station Vita - August 12, 2014\r\n[*]Hohokum -  Play Station Network, Play Station 3, Play Station Vita - August 12, 2014\r\n[*]Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds -  Play Station Vita - August 12, 2014\r\n[*]Risen 3: Titan Lords -  PC, Play Station 3, Xbox 360 - August 12, 2014[/list]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][sp=Gaming Video of the Week][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd9WcUlQKcs[/yt][/sp][/align][/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/lJ3tOFY.png[/img][/align]\r\n     \r\n[align=center]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url] [/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Verizon Plans yo Throttle Unlimited Plan[/color][/b]\r\nCustomers of Verizon who have unlimited may face throttling during peak hours if in the top 5% usage category. FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler, responded to their decision by accusing them of trying to force unlimited customers onto their limited bandwidth plans. Verizon responded by claiming that what they are doing is perfectly legal and other companies are doing it in various ways. They also state that they are doing it for network management and only during peak hours and not to force anyone off their unlimited plan.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]T-Mobile to Follow Verizon on Data Throttling[/color][/b]\r\nCustomers of T-Mobile's old $70 unlimited plan and customers of the $80 Simple Choice plan will soon be faced with throttling just weeks after Verizon announced their plans to throttle its top 5% of unlimited users. The difference between T-Mobile's throttling plan and Verizon's is that T-Mobile already has it in their terms of service that they can throttle customers for p2p sharing; now they will be strictly enforcing it. Furthermore, they will be actively handing out warnings for those who use their networks for p2p sharing. This also applies to customers who use their data heavily for tethering to other devices.\r\n     \r\n[b][color=white]Senate Approves Smartphone Kill-switch in California[/color][/b]\r\nCalifornia State Senate approved a bill that would require all smartphones made after July 1, 2015 to have a kill-switch, however the bill still needs approval from Governor Jerry Brown. California will become the second state behind Minnesota to have a smartphone kill switch if approved. The purpose of the kill-switch is to address the growing rate of smartphone theft in California, but critics of the bill are worried it would be exploited by hackers to more easily steal and exploit someones device. The kill-switch will be user-activated and will render a smartphone useless if stolen until the phone has been returned.\r\n    \r\n[b][color=white]Verizon to Offer $60 Single Line Budget Plan[/color][/b]\r\nVerizon announced on August 15th that they will be offering a new budget plan for only $60 for smartphone users. The plan will only be for single line accounts and cannot have additional lines added within the plan. The plan will come with unlimited talk and text and 2Gb of data per month. This plan is suited well for heavy talk and text based users, but not so much for internet usage as they charge $15 a month per additional 1Gb of data you go over. Also, if you are a Verizon Edge subscriber, you will get a $10 discount on the plan.[/align][/spoiler][/align]",

The man, who remains unamed, was working as a manager of Swiss helicopter company Rega that transported Schumacher to the hospital after he had his accident. Late last year Schumacher injured himself while skiing and suffered a severe head injury which led to a long coma. Thankfully, Schumacher is now recovering. The documents were being sold for around 60,000 dollars and appeared to come from the Helicopter company's location. The man who was suspected for stealing the files denied all charges.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Malaysian Airlines To Be Taken Over by Government[/color][/b]\r\nMalaysian Airlines was on the stock exchange and shares were available for purchase, but Malaysia's state investment company has announced that the Airlines will become fully government owned and will try to resurrect the company from the ground up, with share trading suspended on Friday. This is the result of a double-disaster where one plane has gone missing and has yet to be found, and another was shot down over Eastern Ukraine. Khazanah Nasional, who owns majority shares in the company, has proposed that the carrier's board should buy out minority stocks at around 8 cents a share, the full takeover will cost around $429 million.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Chinese Rocket Crashes Without Explaination[/color][/b]\r\nA Chinese aerospace rocket crashed in Bulong Gachaa, which is a remote area within Mongolia. The rocket caused a large explosion and has created a large impact crater. Many local residence witnessed the event and many Mongolians have been evacuated from their homes. What makes the situation stranger is that photos were posted on social networking site Weibo which showed large clouds of orange but have been deleted without a trace. The Chinese government has yet to respond to the situation but witnesses say officials were quick to the crash site and quickly cleared away the site.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]130 troops sent to Iraq by the USA[/color][/b]\r\nTens of thousands of Yazidi civilians have been trapped on Sin Jar Mountain having been threatened by Islamic extremists. It's been reported that in addition to the 90 US military advisers, a further 130 marines and special forces have been sent to Iraq to help assess the situation, and provide aid in getting civilians to safety. The additional troops arrived on Tuesday in Irbil, east of Sinjar Mountain. President Barack Obama's administration was forced to defend itself against accusations of mission creep after admitting that it was considering a direct role for US forces in creating a philanthropist passageway for an evacuation of the Yazidis. For those who made the journey away from Mount Sin Jar are making temporary homes in dilapidated buildings. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Switzerland Train Derailed In Landslide\r\n[/color][/b]A train has derailed into a ravine near Tiefencastel, between Chur and St Moritz. It's reported that 11 people in total were injured with 5 of them deemed serious. Luckily though, there were no fatalities. The landslide was caused by heavy rain which happened overnight in Eastern Switzerland. It's said the crash, leaving one carriage hanging over the edge and another taking a plunge down into a tree, had over 200 people on-board at the time. Many know the Swiss railways system as the safest in the world, but after Wednesday's occurrence people will beg to question. \r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/2jDDr3o.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955]Sudsy[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Coca-Cola & Monster Merge[/color][/b]\r\nAs sales in soft drinks begin to decline, the iconic Coca-Cola company has just made a $2.15 billion deal to become minor stakeholders in the Monster Energy Corp. In the last year, sales in soft drinks have gone down three percent, while Monster Energy sales went up almost nine percent in the last year. The sales of the drink alone count for over ninety percent of the company's revenue. Monster is now taking over some of Coca-Colas international energy drink brands such as NOS, Full Throttle, and Power Play. However, some of Monster's non-energy drink beverages will be handed over to Coca-Cola, beverages such as Hansen’s Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert’s Lemonade and Hansen’s Juice Products. The Coca-Cola Company will also gain a 16.7 percent ownership interest in Monster. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Fedex Charged with Money Laundering[/color][/b]\r\nAuthorities in the U.S has added money laundering to the list of charges that is against the global shipping company Fedex. The Department of Justice issued a “superseding” indictment Aug. 15 claiming the $44.3 billion transportation company accepted payment for pharmaceutical shipments it knew were illegal. However, Fedex denied all these charges and asked the government to provide a list of the illegal pharmacies. Last month in San Francisco, a grand jury charged Fedex with conspiring internet pharmacies between the years of 2000 and 2010. According to the indictment, Fedex knew the online pharmacies were distributing prescription drugs illegally. The penalties that come with these charges could reach up to $820 million. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]England Offers Hope to Failing European Economy[/color][/b]\r\nOnce described as \"the sick man of Europe\", Great Britain is starting to look as the only bright spot in the United Kingdom. The recovery of the European economy has been punctuated by successes and setbacks. The \"eurozone\" fell again this week, Germany's gross domestic product went down 0.2 percent during the first quarter, and the French economy is showed signs of slow growth during the quarter. By comparison, Britain’s showed resilience, increasing 0.8 percent in the second quarter, according to the updated data released on Friday. On a year-over-year basis, its G.D.P. rose 3.2 percent, just above an estimate made in July of 3.1 percent.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7zqscYZ.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2181647]Nex[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Anatomy Questions Answered with Transparent Mouse[/color][/b]\r\nScientists have been yearning for technology to completely unveil the mysteries of anatomy. Recently scientists at Caltech unveiled how to make small creatures, such as mice and rats, completely translucent. The implications of said discovery are enormous, as now scientists are able to clearly see with their naked eye the anatomical structures of these creatures. The big question is how they did this. Scientist Bin Yang explains that in order to render an organism translucent, you must remove the lipids. The formal procedure for doing so is known as CLARITY, and this could prove to be one of the most ground breaking discoveries in the field of anatomy.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]When Animals Squeal...[/color][/b]\r\nDolphins and Whales are known for their squeals. Most of the human populace thought that the sound waves generated from these squeals were utilized for tracing food. Scientists recently, however, believe that these animals have the same ability to express joy and pleasure as humans. The basis for their claims is from the similar anatomy among complex organisms alike, and with similar brain cognitive structures, scientists are starting to doubt these squeals as merely an anomaly or a tool. Scientists were able to make this claim by measuring the chemical imbalance brought by the production of dopamine during a time interval after the squeal.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Robot Army[/color][/b]\r\nAutomatons have encapsulated the interest of scientists and engineers alike as of late. Recently, 1024 mini robots assembled and created various shapes, including a starfish and even several alphanumeric symbols. The procedures in which these mini robots undertook is very similar to that of ants. The implications of programming such a swarm are important for the future of creating artificial intelligence. This is because now we know that robots can in fact mimic, in numbers, the same actions as primitive organisms such as ants.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/X56H7t7.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476]Feynman[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=872076]Mahdy[/url] [/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Countering Cervical Cancer with HPV[/color][/b]\r\nBeing one of the most dangerous cancers in women, cervical cancer is a hot topic in cancer research. Over 90% of cases of cervical cancer have been linked to HPV, the world's most common STI. By hijacking HPV's genome, researchers deactivated two of the virus's genes responsible for cervical cancer, causing abnormal cells to self-destruct and leaving healthy cells unaffected. The team hopes that this method can be used in similar diseases such as Herpes Simplex and Hepatitis B.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]The Equation to Happiness[/color][/b]\r\nResearchers from UCL have developed an equation that can predict moment-to-moment happiness in people, a feat that has never been done before. Using over 18,000 volunteers, the team discovered that overall happiness isn't just a factor of how well things are going, but whether or not things are going better than expected. As with previous studies, rewards also strongly affected an individual's happiness. The team hope that by making happiness quantifiable, doctors and therapists working with mood disorders will have a better way to determine the best treatment in the growing trend of individualized treatment.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Vitamin D and Dementia[/color][/b]\r\nA large-scale study has determined that there is a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and dementia-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's. The study, a collaboration between 6 institutes, found that people who have moderate vitamin D deficiency were 69% more likely to develop Alzheimer's, and those who were severely vitamin D deficient were 122% more likely to develop the disease. This was the first large-scale study of its kind, and more research is being planned to determine the role vitamin D plays in preventing Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Repairing Stroke Damage with Stem Cells[/color][/b]\r\nOnce viewed as the be-all end-all to disease, stem cell therapy lost a lot of momentum due to moral dilemmas and a few disastrous trials. However, with new protocols in place designed to iron out past issues, many researchers are once again turning to stem cells to treat disease. A new study has been published this past week, showing that stem cells can be used to effectively reduce brain damage caused by severe strokes. In the limited study, stem cells extracted from a patient's bone marrow were implanted 7 days after a severe stroke. Out of five patients, four experienced the most severe type of stroke, which has a 4% survival rate. Six months after the stem cells were implanted, three of these four could live independently, and the fourth had significantly less lasting damage than is typical. The trial, designed primarily to test the safety of stem cell therapy, opens new doors for developing more successful treatments to severe strokes.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]",

With big plays and being his final season playing, this has been a great year for Jeter. Over the years he has passed many great players such as Paul Molitor (3,319), Carl Yastrzemski (3,419), as well as many other players such as the previously mentioned Wagner. Jeter is now up there with most of the big league hitters from the past so let's see if he can finish just as strong! \n\n[b][color=white]The Party's Over[/color][/b]\nPolice investigated a scene at a nightclub in downtown Minneapolis where a shooting broke out. Nine people were injured in the incident, including Minnesota Vikings' defensive tackle, Linval Joseph. According to a statement issued by the team Joseph was shot in the calf. Joesph was in the process of celebrating after a win against the Raiders that same day, only to end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Others injured from the scene were reported to be in harsh conditions but are said to be recovering and will survive. Club owner Johann Sfaellos states that no problems were apparent prior to the gunfire. Sfaellos was quoted as saying, \"Suddenly, a person just pop, pop, pop. The whole thing was surreal. It was out of the blue.\" Joseph is fine as of now and the injury he suffered was minor.\n\n[b][color=white]Sister Showdown[/color][/b]\nSisters Serena and Venus Williams will be competing against each other at the Rogers Cup this Friday the 9th. With both competitors' mindset to win the match, they both know it will be a tough battle and that the stronger will prevail. After the recent incident this summer with Venus were she was removed from the seniors tour, every fan in the stadium will definitely be up on their feet for this match. As both Serena and Venus won 5 of their matches in a role to get this far, Serena had said about her sister, \"I definitely don't like playing her -- I think I've lost to her more than anyone else on the tour. So it's definitely not a fun match for me, to be honest. But she's tough. She has a great serve. She runs every ball down. she has a great backhand. She hits winners off the forehand.\" At Wimbledon Venus almost won against Petra Kvitova. Ever since that match, Venus has been working on her training and practicing throughout the whole summer. Venus' fitness and physical state has improved since she got sick. Which sister will pull through and take home the glory?\n\n[b][color=white]Manziel's First Appearance[/color][/b]\nManziel played in his first NFL atmosphere type game today against the Detroit Lions. Brian Hoyer started out the game, like last year, but Manziel came out not too long after. Each quarterback got a fair amount of playing time so it is unanswered who will be the starter on opening day for the Browns. Manziel told reporters that he had a lot of bad reads that he would like to take back but for the most part he was pleased with how they played. Manziel was very quick in the pocket, just like in college, and was able to elude the rush plays. He was hammered on a couple of plays and was briefly checked on the sidelines. No injuries so he went back in. He relaxed a little bit and became more comfortable as time set in and made a few more runs. Manziel finished for 7/11 for 63 yards with six rushes for a total of 27 yards. Final score: 13-12 Lions\n\n[b][color=white]Lebron is Staying[/color][/b]\nLebron spoke at an Akron scrimmage this week about the future of his career, stating that he has no intentions to leave the Cavs. Is it possible that he will finish out his career in Cleveland? He also did a little speaking about his (possible) future teammate, Kevin Love. As you may know, the trade is between Andrew Wiggins and Kevin Love. Lebron has nothing but positive comments on Love, \"I don't even really care about the 26 points and 12 rebounds, I care about his basketball IQ. His basketball IQ is very, very high. I had the opportunity to spend 32 days with him in the 2012 Olympics. He was huge for us ... he's a great piece.\" Due to NBA league rules neither team is allowed to have any form of agreement until at least the 23rd because that would be when Wiggins is available for trade.\n\n[b][color=white]Can Trevor Knight Keep It Up?[/color][/b]\nThe sophomore quarterback that took part in possibly one of the biggest upsets in BCS era is returning to the field as a starter this season. The main question is, was that a one time thing? Everyone who has heard of the OU/Alabama game last year knows of Knight's performance. Completing an unreal 32 of 44 passes, throwing for 348 yards, and four touchdowns. Was that him just showing the world the potential he has in him? With a lot of key components of the offense returning, such as three year starter Sterling Shepard, it is very possible to see this as a regular performance from Knight. \"We've known Trevor was going to be a great quarterback,\" said Sooners offensive tackle Tyrus Thompson, \"It was just a matter of him showing everybody else that.\" \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/OTwL2QW.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=853832]Dr. Ocean[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]U.S. Schools Struggling to Assimilate Large Numbers of Immigrant Students[/color][/b]\nIn schools accepting immigrant students around the country, there has been a growing number of Hispanic children being enrolled in schools. This so far has caused a great amount of stress on the faculty that run these schools. According to one teacher, about 2 new students per day were arriving in her English for Speakers of Other Languages Class for over a month. Hundreds of trailers are being used to extend schools for the influx of these students, and the number only keeps increasing. About 50,000 unaccompanied children have made their way into the U.S. this summer alone. It remains to be seen how this will impact schools starting this fall. While many of these minors are being transferred to temporary communities in the meantime, a permanent solution remains to be seen.\n\n[b][color=white]New Grand Canyon Community in Construction[/color][/b]\nIn a special place at the Grand Canyon, where some Native Americans consider sacred, few have been able to behold the vast beauty which has been widely untouched by human hands. That will soon change though. As part of a construction project with a budget of a billion dollars, a new resort community with hotels (and even a gondola system which will allow tourists to access the floor of the canyon) is being built. This area is currently over 25 miles away from any major roads, and is quite remote, almost too remote. There has been some controversy over if construction should even take place in such a sacred place held only by nature. Only time will tell the fate of such an untouched part of the canyon\n\n[b][color=white]100th Anniversary of the Start of WWI[/color][/b]\nThis is an anniversary which isn't a cause for celebration. It should stand as a reminder of the 10 million soldiers who sacrificed their lives for what they believed in. At one point in time, called the \"Great War,\" it was the first war of modern times with all the destructive technology that came with it. Total war, nobody was left out. The impact was truly global as European powers clashed. Along with this came the new tactic that seemed to symbolize battles during this time, trench warfare. Just sitting in a trench, unmoving, hoping that the enemy's commander would signal to charge first - it was nasty. This wouldn't be the only war of the century however. The effects of this conflict would eventually lead to the second global war of the century, the true \"Great War.\"[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9i91OzMl.jpg[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081] Justin Timberlake[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1518613]1001[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]George Clooney is Off the Market[/color][/b]\nThe award-winning actor is ditching his bachelor status as he prepares to wed his fiancée, Amal Alamuddin.

Black Cat is supposedly the most likely of the candidates. Sony has also contacted Lisa Joy Nolan to write the movie script, along with a short list of characters to potentially put into the film.

Not much is known about the film other than what was released in the trailer. It is known that the trailer doesn't touch the subject of his second wife or personal affairs past his first marriage. The exact release date of the film is also unknown, but from the looks of it, it will sure be an interesting one!\n\n[b][color=white]Robin Williams Dead At 63[/color][/b]\nOn August 11th, Robin Williams was found dead in his home by suicide. According to Robin Williams' wife, he was also suffering from Parkinson's Disease and depression at the time of his death.

It was a messy way of showing information and it was quite expensive too, considering the wasted seconds needed to show the message. In the recent years filmmakers adopted the method of showing text messages on the screen without the need of looking at the phone through the characters eyes. A couple of examples where this method has been adopted are Sherlock, House of Cards, and Non-Stop. The next problem that filmmakers are trying to solve is how to portray the Internet.
