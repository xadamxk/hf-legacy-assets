One year later, that same boy, known by then as Sir, gained leadership of what was to become a cornerstone of the Hack Forums community, a weekly periodical reporting on the ins and outs of the forum. Thus the HF News was truly born, gaining a leader that would not only see it through the next four years but a leader who would push its limits, cement its role in the community, and set the standard for online, hacking-oriented journalism. Had Sir not taken leadership of the news, it may very well have perished years ago; his hundreds of hours of work and guidance have seen to nearly 200 successful editions, and the establishment of a strong system which will guide the news through the weeks, months, and years to come. While his departure was inevitable - after all, we all outgrow everything eventually - there's no doubt that his legacy and works will continue to better the forum and its members who so enthusiastically log onto it every day. This one's for you, Sir. You may be gone, but your team will continue to build upon what you have created. Long live Sir, the High King of the Quill!\r\n\n[b][color=white]Country Blacklist Introduced for PayPal Payments[/color][/b]\r\nAfter an apparent surge in fraudulent upgrades ending with reversals from PayPal, the payment processor, a list of countries that PayPal upgrades will remain available has been created by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url].

Have any shout outs you want to make before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to give a shoutbout to my best friend Bandors for being an all around awesome guy to be around and having taught me a lot of things about myself in the process.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] So tell us Tutelary, how'd you get started with Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] I remembered registering in 2010 to try to hack Facebook accounts. I ended up failing at this goal and leaving the site for reasons that I really don't remember to this day. Two years later, I came back to the site for reasons I still don't remember. Though I was always hesitant to contribute on Hack Forums because I was really a lurker, I would read all these posts and tutorials and guides but never really contribute. Then some person with a problem similar to what I had came up so I commented on their thread, and my comment helped fixed their issue.  That gave me a good feeling so I did it again and again. I became a contributor instead of a lurker. These posts were mostly in the RAT section and this section is where I derive a large amount of posts. About 50% of my posts are in that one section. I bought L33t for myself, and enjoyed it, and applied for Ub3r almost immediately and to my excitement after about a month, got accepted. I won an upgrade contest and then got upgraded to Ub3r. I bought 3P1C with my own money and enjoyed that too. I've written several tutorials on HF, some simple, some complex, some about RATs, others not and have had numerous experiences. I've made money on Hack Forums. I've made friends on Hack Forums. All in all, in spite of some other skirmishes, I have enjoyed my time on Hack Forums and still continue to do so.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Woah, it seems like Hack Forums really made an impact on your life. Have you set any goals for yourself as you spend your time on Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] I didn't really elaborate too much on when exactly my peak was and when I started to taper out in terms of posting and contributing. I've sort of gone from lurker -> contributor -> kinda lurker/kinda contributor. Back when I was posting a lot, creating tutorials, and all of that, I remember distinctly reading something that was wrong and saying 'This needs to be fixed'. That was my Darkcomet tutorial. A lot of tutorials would tell you to do a lot of different settings which would ultimately end in corrupting the stub. I created my tutorial to ensure that the end result stub would not be corrupted. I did this by ensuring that the user turns off all settings possible in the stub creation. That's something really simple that a lot of users didn't know about, so I opted to create a tutorial. I've really been out of that mindset. I don't really make too many tutorials anymore, I don't really post actively in the RAT section (mainly because of outside time restraints), and I don't post too actively anyways. Looking at my posts even now, they vary between dates but I generally post about 2 times a day nowadays. When I was really active, I was boasting probably about 80 posts a day. Now I'm not. Though to get back to the real question you asked, I did have some goals specifically:\r\n* Get the RAT Expert award.\r\n* Get 10000 posts.\r\n* Get 5000 posts in the RAT section.\r\n* Find some way to make money with my RAT setup stuff.\r\n* Get 100 slaves.\r\n\nI've done none of those things. RAT Expert--Never gonna happen. Been aiming for that for awhile and although I've noticed a trend with that if you buy master donator, you get another award generally after it. (Sometimes but not always.)  The 10000 posts, I had about 8400 until the junked posts were cleaned out, I'm not complaining but given my state of activity, I'm never gonna reach 1000 posts. 5000 posts in RAT section - With my state of activity and outside time restraints, I can't do this. I did however succeed with making money with the RAT setup stuff; I have a RAT service which I did get some takers with but all in all, it hasn't netted me much. Getting a 100 slaves was arbitrary and was more of a challenge. My max was about 62 before I lost nearly all of them next day. Fun stuff. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Those are realistic goals. I'm sure with a lot of dedication, you will reach them in no time. What made you so interested in RATs?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest, I was first interested in keyloggers. Keyloggers--the infamous, malicious software which could get all of your passwords! Argh. So evil, obviously! I would setup keylogger after keylogger after keylogger and spread them and literally, maybe get 1 or 2 equivalent of 'slaves'. The keyloggers at the time were usually choppy or would somehow not capture the money shot. I had one which would somehow always capture the username, but never the password. It was one that took screenshots too, so you could see this account but god, it was like it was teasing me. So I looked around. I saw on a lot of threads that people were recommending RATs like Darkcomet or Cybergate because you could do a lot more things with them. I checked them out, and pretty much failed at portforwarding for a few months. (Legitly, I look back on it and I cry at how dimwitted I was.) It turns out that I was entering some other IPv4 address into the router page and that was screwing it up. Oh and Windows Firewall was on. But then I finally got portforwarding working, and I tried for about 4 hours to get one slave. I tried all different sorts of settings, crypter variants, even different RATs to get a single slave. It was awful because I remember about 90% of the time, the stub was corrupted and I didn't know that and I would just spend this time still spreading this stub which couldn't infect. Anywho, I finally managed to get one on Cybergate. Christmas. Christmas was what it felt like. I did everything, fucked with him, and he ultimately tapered off but I had that joy. I was able to monitor everything on him. It was surreal. \r\n\nNo longer do I needed to be chained to these inferior 'keyloggers' with busted features and only one primary function. I got into RATs because of what all you can do with them.  Remote Desktop, Webcam, Process Manager, Registry, complete control. That appealed to me, that ability to do pretty much anything you want, monitor anything you want on their computer. It's just awesome in my honest opinion. Not to mention fascinating; considering that WikiLeaks leaked FinSpy; A government RAT that a lot of governments use. Turns out that I'm not the only one interested in such a tool.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Wow! RATs are quite fun to mess with. Are you still playing with RATs today?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] No. I am not. I personally uninstalled the 6 slaves that had no antiviruses or would just somehow always be within my Darkcomet myself. I would only use them really for testing other people's RATs on them. I stopped honestly because I just lost interest at some points as well as schooling. Sure with RATs you can do a bunch of other stuff with them, like X, Y, and Z but even with that excitement, it loses its interest. I also started focusing more on schooling than on Hackforums. Oh and to be clear, it wasn't a conscious choice. \"I'm gonna stop focusing on RATs so much!\" It just was in steps, drop posting rate in RAT section, comment on only a few threads, stop going there, lurk more, post on other sections, lurk more, etc. It wasn't an immediate reaction, probably over a period of 2 months.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. The time you've spent here on Hack Forums and with RATs, I'm sure you've encountered dramas here and there. Have you heard the recent drama with the wiki?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] Oh sure there's been lots of drama with RATs. People being accused of infecting members or people legitimately stealing Hack Forums accounts via RATs. I remember distinctly mine was stolen merely because I had thought Sandboxie was safe to run a RAT in. Sure it prevents writing to the registry and from creating new files on your actual computer, but it doesn't prevent read access. They can still steal your passwords, your files, your wifi passwords, photos, documents, etc. They just can't create anything. They can still download shit or copy your stuff. So my stored passwords got stolen and they jacked my Hack Forums account. Thankfully Factor8 is a beast and helped me recover it, but it was legit so sketchy when my original password didn't work and I just had a feeling.\r\n\nRegarding the Wiki situation, there are a lot of dramas on Hack Forums that can really shake up the community. There are a few I can shake off hand: Blackshades, Marketers, some well known account closures, and the like. The wiki one is a drama indeed but it's a drama for a reason. On Wikis, it's fundamental to have transparency and have the community and the owners discuss things and come to a consensus. It's why on a lot of wikis, community input is essential and 80% of the time, content disputes happen and they are resolved by the community. It's not really a big deal. The big disputes come in when the owners get involved and the community is against what the owners want to do. They're both going in different directions. Something's got to give. Some people are gonna get blocked, pages are gonna get protected, the community migrates or the like. What happened with the wiki is it seems that some people of the Wiki team didn't really listen with what the community was saying or wanting. Communication, understanding, and what the community wants are heavily needed in Wiki situations. So another Wiki was created to address those pitfalls, Sir spearheaded such a thing and created a sticky on it on HF (which may not have been the best idea) and ended up getting his account closed as a result. He was then unclosed and then closed again shortly after but not before posting all of his suggestions in his drafts and commenting on a lot of things. \r\n\nWhat I think the Wiki situation boiled down to is that the upper management appeared to not listen to the lower management (which is the potential editors, editors, as well as readers) and when they did listen to the lower management, they would put these heavy caveats on what the lower management had wanted and essentially water it down to something that barely resembled what the community had wanted. It's not rocket science to see that it's still not exactly a popular wiki and no one's really getting pumped up about it. That's not usual on HF with a new feature--especially something so prominent in the header. Some features are just heavily praised by the community, others get mixed feedback, this is mostly negative for various reasons. I also can't offer any immediate solutions other than the upper management to actually listen and implement some of the suggestions by lower management. And if not implement, heavily listen as well as observe. Conducting a wide HF survey to figure out what exactly is unpopular could also be beneficial. Actually using the unpopularity for feedback and using it to better the wiki would be helpful.\r\n\nThe Unofficial Hack Forums wiki was a bit better aesthetically than the official one, and seemed to be more 'open' but it's not anything too special, but it really didn't have a chance to get off the ground. Even now, I tried to visit it and got a forbidden 403 error. So I can't really give good feedback on it because I looked at it once, looked at a few pages, and that was that.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] You seem to have an interest for wikis. Is my assumption correct?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] Oh yes. I contribute to various wikis some sporatically, some regularly, some extremely regularly, but I generally know how they work. Wikipedia in itself is rather strict and has policies and guidelines as well as practices which have generally been refined over the years. You pretty much know how the community of Wikipedia is going to react over something or if you do X, what the reaction would be. On other Wikis, it's not so clear. Some Wikis don't have clear, defined rules so it can be difficult to exactly know where the boundaries are. But yes, I have an interest with wikis because I know about them. I used to always go to the 'talk' pages of Wikipedia and see these editors argue about certain things which may seem trivial to me, all to the benefit of who's going to be put on the single Wikipedia page. Sometimes I felt bad that one editor lost, felt good that another won, or was indifferent. \r\n\nBut Wikis in general are a beautiful thing. A lot of Wikis are published under CC BY SA 3.0, which is basically 'you can do whatever you want, create copies, derivatives, even for commercial use as long as you attribute the author.' That's huge. Copyright is everywhere, and the fact that Wikis are published under a free license with only a simple attribution is needed? Not to mention that the model in itself is ingenius. The community edits the article and ensures its correct and accurate. The community being anybody who wants to edit. Collaboration is great too. You add something, someone else spoofs it up a bit and it's in the article forever. You rewrite a paragraph and someone else maybe fixes your typo. It's really beautiful. They fascinate me and enthrall me.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] While we're on the topic of wikis, what would you like to see from the HF Wiki in the future?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] Like I mentioned before, the upper management listening to the lower management and maybe implementing some of their suggestions. What I see even now is that I don't see any wiki person really discussing things in public; On the Wiki Talk forum. This makes me suspect that they are doing it elsewhere, without the community involved in this talk. Also what I mean in this 'discussing things in public' thing I'm not meaning answer questions. They have been doing that. But the real decision making does not happen at the Wiki Talk forums. It's either happening in the Writ3rs' subforum or elsewhere. That's part of the problem. The community doesn't seem to have really much of a say in things. Sure you answer their questions in some sort of manner, but it doesn't seem that you're really concerned about actually implementing what they're talking about or acknowledging it further. \r\n\nWhat I'd like to see is polling, surveys, voting on what to do in the wiki; stuff to make the community feel like it's making a difference on the direction of the Wiki goes. The power seems to rest not in the community, but elsewhere. Other than things that require legal attention, the community should have as much power on the wiki as the upper management does in terms of where it goes. Moving that power from upper management to lower management would solve a lot of the issues of not enough editors, the rules, and the like.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I get you. Hopefully things will be better in the future. Now, enough with the internet. Tell us more about yourself outside of the world wide web.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I plan to become a Computer Programmer by the time I'm 22 or the alternative job profession that I'm seeking would be working in IT. IT just in general fascinates me because you have all of these moving parts and these people you have to provide support for. You basically have to keep everything running smoothly and if things aren't running smoothly, you're blamed. If they are, then they ask, \"Why do they need you?\" and crap like that. \r\n\nI watch a lot of Youtube videos, browse Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit, and edit Wikis. I also play this stupid little game called 'Naruto Arena.'. I don't even watch Naruto anymore because I lost interest in that entire genre yet I've gotten pretty far into the game. It's a terrible game and no one should play it. It's got a toxic community, horrible balance, non-action scenes, and is basically a card game that you play with other people. Only instead of being dynamic, each character predictably has 4 moves, and you select 3 characters to battle against another person to hopefully move up in the ladder or to unlock more characters. It's hard, difficult, unwelcoming to newcomers yet I still play it. It's stupid, don't play it.\r\n\nFor me personally, I have long hair, no criminal record, no girlfriend or SO, and I love soda. It's one of my horrible vices.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] With hard work and dedication, I'm sure you'll reach that goal. What's your social life like?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] I'm honestly not a 'make friends' type of person in real life. I don't often engage in too many conversations, not because I genuinely can't have any friends, it's just that generally, too much stuff that people talk about in school just bores me. I also can't really deal too much in other people's lives because I worry about my own. I have had friends before but generally don't have too many now. Though online, it's substantially easier to make friends than in real life, and have several 'online' friends.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] That's perfectly okay if you ask me. Are some of these 'online' friends people you've met on Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, some of these friends are people I've met on Hack Forums.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I appreciate you taking the time to do this with me. Would you like to say anything else before we wrap this up?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=341617][color=white][b]Tutelary:[/b][/color][/url] Eh, I could say something really funny or whatever here. I'm just gonna say thanks for interviewing me. I appreciate the opportunity to be apart of HF News.\r\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] For the 232nd edition of the HF News, we have the big man Roger Waters in the house. Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to give a shout out to all my homies keeping it real in Debug and The Brotherhood. They're the real MVPs.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] You've been leadership of Brotherhood, in effect, since Aura left. How has it been going for you?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] It's been pretty good, though I've been a leader since September or so. Due to Aura's unfortunate departure from HF I've been able to step up and make some changes to the group, try things out, etc. It's been a good experience so far, I'm learning as I'm going. We've tried some experiments which have failed and some others which were successful. As a leader of a group that's just what happens and as a newer leader I naturally try some more things a more experienced leader would. I wouldn't change the experience so far for anything.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Are there any cogs turning for events, tutorials, or something big from the group?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I'm planning on bringing the group back to its roots, kicking inactives and only having the people who genuinely care about the group. We've recently retired the Hacking and Graphics sectors which is a start to that. The Computing and Gaming Sectors have always been pretty strong so if anything we're going to work on that along with inviting some old members who were in the group when it was first founded. I'm thinking that our Computing Sector could really tie in with the Debug group once we have everything launched in that group.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds great. What else is going on with Debug? I'm going to be sorting through teacher applications with you, of course, but what else lies beyond that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] After we get some teachers for Coding, we'll be looking into getting members for the Computing Side of the group through recruitment and invitations.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] What are our plans for Computing? I'm only involved in coding (and it appears as though I'll be running Coding with Snorlax's ban), so I'm not sure what else is going on.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] We plan on doing a collaboration of sorts with The Brotherhood's Computing Sector and possibly reviving the Student Program that was started up a while back to teach members about White Hat Helping. That's still in the works and we still need to finalize some things but that's the idea I have in mind. With every step we make, we're going to take it slow so we don't get too ahead of ourselves.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] What has been your favorite past group? Not current ones, but groups that have come and gone.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Not sure. I've had plenty of good times in previous groups such as The Empire, Legacy, Instinct, and more. I can't put down what my favorite one was, simply because I've had a good time in many past groups.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] If you could bring back any of those groups, or even one aspect that you were most fond of instead of the group in its entirety, what would you pull and why?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] With those groups, it felt more like a family. Members were there for each other and actually cared about the group, I feel like that isn't the case with most groups today. Members care more about having userbars on their profile than anything. With The Empire, most of its core members still talk with each other to this day and I feel like the group is still here even though they don't have a userbar for it.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Do you want Debug or Brotherhood to ever become great parts of HF history like the groups you mentioned?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. I believe The Brotherhood has begun to make a legacy on the site. Our 2 year anniversary is coming up in June. We've accomplished a lot over the years and we still have things coming up. Debug's journey has just begun and we hope it will stay here for a while.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] I see that happening. Unfortunately, that's all the time we've got. Any closing comments or remarks?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=white][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for having me. Everyone should look forward to future Debug and Brotherhood group opportunities.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]  [/color]",

A single Korean security researcher named Jung Hoon Lee while under the pseudonym \"lokihardt\" had exploited both stable and beta versions of Google Chrome with a buffer overflow, which occurs when more data is placed into a place in memory than was allocated, and a race condition, which occurs when two or more threads attempt to access data simultaneously with a program that was over 2,000 lines long. He was paid $75,000 for the standalone exploit and another $25,000 for a privilege escalation bug using another race condition in two separate Windows Kernel drivers. In addition to this, Google had paid him an additional $10,000 as a part of Project Zero. He won a total of $110,000 which is the single largest payout since the competition began in 2007. In addition to Lee's work, other major hackers were able to successfully exploit Internet Explorer (no surprise there), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple's Safari browsers causing them to update their software and making a more secure experience for the consumers.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Silk Road Moderator Faces Life in Prison[/b][/color]\r\nThe Dark Web has long been known to hold some of the world's most nefarious services including a wide drug market, underage pornography, illegal weaponry, hired assassins, and even human trafficking. Many, if not all, of these services could have been found at the cesspool that was The Silk Road. After having been taken down several times, one of the moderators, Peter Nash, who is most recently under the pseudonym \"samesamebutdifferent,\" pleaded 'guilty' in a US District Court to several charges including conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking and money laundering. After Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind Silk Road,  was caught and charged for numerous federal crimes, many members of the Silk Road team are being caught and convicted. Nash was a moderator on the forum for 10 months and was paid approximately $75,000 for his services. He was responsible for monitoring users' activity, instructing newcomers on how to successfully conduct 'business' on the Silk Road, among other things. Both the Silk Road and the Evolution Market, known for their illegal activities, are out of service for the foreseeable future.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Google Accidentally Leaks 280,000+ Domain Records[/b][/color]\r\nThe Internet giant, Google, runs a service called [url=https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/]Apps for Business[/url] which allows businesses to manage and run their applications and domains with limited security. For an extra $6/month, you can pay to have your data hidden from public view and be contained to the registrar eNom unless law enforcement requests it with a warrant. However, a bug in Google's system that goes back as far as 2013 allowed the information to be publicly available once the domain was re-registered. This means that the whois record, including names, private addresses, phone numbers, and emails were leaked, unprotected, as soon as you re-registered your domain. Since 2013, over 282,000 domains were re-registered and had their information leaked, unintentionally, by Google. Luckily, many of the registrants use fake data for the Whois record, as is evidenced by the use of obviously fake names and addresses, but many of them are perfectly valid causing the physical locations of the websites and/or their owners to be released into potentially malicious hands.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Hackers Are Being Chased After Stealing Information on Millions of Clients from JPMorgan Chase[/b][/color]\r\nDuring last summer's cyber attack on JPMorgan chase, hackers were able to get over 83 million phone numbers and emails of households and tiny companies. National authorities are looking into the hack at JPMorgan and are extremely  confident that a illegal case will be filed against these hackers in the following months. Law enforcement were able to establish some suspects earlier on. The JPMorgan examination is being taken care of at high levels of the law enforcement, with the F.B.I in New York several senior agents to the matter along with a top prosecutor with the computer crimes union.\r\n\n[color=white][b]CIA have been wanting to hack into Apple[/b][/color]\r\nResearches that have been working in the CIA have continuously worked for over ten years on hacking into the safety of Apple products. The Intercept news website claims attacks on apple from the government researchers may have started as early as 2006. \"The Intercept has in earlier years also published a variety of reports from files released by whistleblower Snowden. The website’s editors include Glenn Greenwald, who received a Pulitzer Prize for his work in reporting on Snowden’s exposures, and by Laura Poitras the Oscar – winning documentary maker. It said the newest files, which enclosed a period from 2006 to 2013, stop short of establishing whether United States spy researchers had accomplished breaking into Apple’s encryption code, which secures consumer information and communications.\"\r\n[/align][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/6B3tfQb.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=46411]zer0-[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][align=left]\r\n\n[b][color=white]NYPD Caught Hacking Into FBI Traffic Databases[/color][/b]\r\nA deputy inspector with the NYPD was recently arrested for allegedly breaking into restricted databases which included one run by the FBI. Yehuda Katz was the one responsible and was told to be after thousands of people’s personal information who have been a part of traffic accidents/incidents. He was pretending to be a lawyer who could help victims of these accidents take legal action. Overtime, he was able to install multiple devices within the Traffic Safety Office which in turn allowed him to remotely access NYPD and federal databases including the one run by the FBI. Katz is now looking upwards of 10 years in prison for his actions.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Issues With Apples New OS X Update[/color][/b]\r\nLast week Apple pushed a mess of updates out which were later changed to “Security Update 2015-002”. Unfortunately, the patches released within this security update need to be patched themselves. Supposedly, Apple was said to have patched specific bugs in earlier patches but the new “Security Update 2015-003” will be patching the new ones to do this specific function. The bugs needing to be patched were directed towards the IOSurface Programming Framework. Another thing to add, besides these new security updates being pushed out by Apple, users should also have Safari 8.0.4, which allows you to fix many security holes in Apple’s browser.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Ransomware Effecting Gamers - TeslaCrypt[/color][/b]\r\nA new ransomware by the name of TeslaCrypt is specifically targeting Window’s users. It is very similar to ransomwares like CryptoWall and CrytoLocker except has the ability to ransom off more files then the two previous. On top of searching normal files ransomware looks for like photos, videos, and other media, TeslaCrypt also searches for files related to gaming; saved games, configurations, maps, and replays. Many very popular games are being effected such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Fallout, DayZ, and Minecraft to name a few. It is much more advanced in the sense that almost all files can be ransomed instead of a few specific ones that other ransomwares may focus on.\r\n\n[/align][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/nBxEnyE.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=981500]Premortal[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1864779]Red Sоx[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][align=left]\r\n\n[b][color=white]New Nintendo Platform Announced\r\n[/color][/b]It has been officially confirmed by Nintendo that they’re currently working on a new gaming platform. It has not been announced whether or not the platform is going to be a console or a handheld gaming device. “NX” is the codename being used for the development of this new gaming system. The announcement came during a press conference in Tokyo, with the main focus of the event being Nintendo’s explanation regarding their decision to enter the mobile gaming market through the game specializing company DeNA. The exact quote regarding the project codenamed NX was this: [url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/17/nintendo-new-gaming-hardware-platform-codenamed-nx]“As proof that Nintendo maintains strong enthusiasm for the dedicated game system business, let me confirm that Nintendo is currently developing a dedicated game platform with a brand-new concept under the development codename NX. It is too early to elaborate on the details of this project, but we hope to share more information with you next year.”[/url]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Free Sling TV for Xbox One Owners\r\n[/color][/b]With the introduction of Sling TV on Xbox LIVE systems on March 17th, owners of the Xbox One will receive a month of the service for free. The Xbox One is the first console to get this service, which provides television streaming from a number of channels, such as ESPN and AMC among others. Although this service is being provided by a third-party, Microsoft is promising a lot of voice and gesture-control integration with the new service. The regular cost for Sling TV is $20 a month for the basic package and another $5 for every additional package selected. Current Xbox One owners are eligible for a free month trial of the service, while people who purchase an Xbox One after the 17th will receive three months of the service for free, although it’s unclear as to how long this offer is going to last. Sling TV CEO had this to say about the service: [url=http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/17/xbox-one-begins-slinging-live-tv-today-with-1-month-trial/]“Xbox has been at the forefront of gaming and technology for years, so it made sense to bring Sling TV to the passionate Xbox user. For many millennials, Xbox One is already the center of their living room experience, and we want to reach these fans to show there’s a better way to get live TV that doesn’t require a long-term commitment, high programming costs, additional wires, or hidden fees.”[/url]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Platforms for Star Wars: Battlefront Confirmed[/color][/b]\r\nIt has been announced via Twitter the platforms that the highly anticipated title [i]Star Wars: Battlefront[/i] will be released on. The tweet, which can be found [url=https://twitter.com/eastarwars/status/578601463183638528]here[/url], reads as follows: \"Star Wars Battlefront will be available holiday 2015, on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.\" The tweet comes from the official Twitter page for Star Wars games by EA. The game's release will be exclusive to current-gen consoles along with PC. Information regarding its release date is less specific, although \"holiday 2015\" can fairly easily be attributed to a December release for the game.

The Galaxy S6 Edge is a variation on the main device that has a display wrapping around the side, in order to display notifications and other useful information while boasting a metal and glass construction reminiscent of the iPhone 4. As one might expect, the Galaxy S6 Edge will be considerably more expensive than the standard Samsung Galaxy S6. The successor to the Galaxy S5 is set to hit stores on April 10 in 20 countries with a price tag starting at £760 for the 64GB S6 Edge.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Twitter Puts Trillions of Tweets Up for Sale to Data Miners[/color][/b]\r\nTwitter’s quickly growing advertising business has gained lots of attention recently as the company prepares for an initial public offering. Selling promoted tweets is not the only way the social network generates revenue. Companies interested in gauging consumer reactions related to anything from computers to pop stars are shelling out millions to harvest and analyze the collective opinions of the \"Twitterverse\".\r\n\nIt is not only commercial interests that are being mined for data. Data mining companies are using data collected from Twitter in an attempt to shed light on whether Premier League players are overpaid – with a team of researchers from from top universities such as Reading, Dundee and Cambridge testing whether professional footballers’ salaries are related purely to performance on the pitch or can be boosted by popularity on social media. Selling user data only amounts to a small percent of Twitter's overall income – $70 million out of a total of $1.3 billion last year, with the lion’s share of cash coming from advertising, but the social network has big plans to increase that.\r\n\n[b][color=white]How Wearable Technology Will Shape the Future of Sports[/color][/b]\r\nIn 2015, the hottest new tech devices won't be stored in our purses or pockets – they'll be worn on our wrists, plugged into our ears and even embedded in our clothes and running shoes. For today's weekend jogger, professional runner, or an exercise advocate, wearable technology is no longer a high-tech novelty; it's an essential training tool.\r\n\nTake smart-watches and fitness trackers that deliver real-time measurement of metrics from heart rate to skin temperature to perspiration for example. Combined with inferences found through data analysis on performance and quality of sleep, athletes can track everything from calories burned to sleep quality to improve their workouts and overall well-being. Innovations like this are one reason why Intel views wearable technology as the new frontier of computing. Wearable technology opens up a world of transformative experiences that are different from a smartphone. These devices enrich the entire athletic experience, providing data that can increase motivation, enhance training and ultimately improve performance.\r\n\n[/align][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]   [/color]",
