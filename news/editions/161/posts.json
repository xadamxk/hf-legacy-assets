To encourage participation, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has decided that users who put a lot of effort into the server will be able to purchase the [url=http://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=68]HackerCraft award[/url]. When the auto-buy server plugin is finished  users will be able to spend in game currency, called Eco-Money (EM), to buy the award.\nThe current pricing for the award will be 50,000 EM, however with an impending economy restructuring due to recent abuse of exploits, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] suggested that he may increase the price dramatically. When users will be able to purchase the award is not known yet, but we can expect it to be soon.

How About Its New Section On HF?[/b][/color]\nDue to Rockstar's newest game release (Grand Theft Auto V) and an [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3751964]active suggestion thread[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] granted the game series its own section. So far, the section has shown major activity (as expected) and people seem to love it. Many discussions regarding the series itself (especially that of GTA V), their missions, and their reviews have been going on since [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=290]the section[/url]'s addition under HF Gamers Zone. Let's see if its activity remains.\n\n[color=white][b]Pakistan Removed from HF's Blocklist[/b][/color]\nFollowing [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/379751639248166912]a Tweet[/url] from [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], Pakistan has been removed from HF's official blocklist allowing IP's from there to access HF freely as any others would. Omniscient calls Pakistan's unblocking their rejoice and perhaps hints that the action may only be temporary by stating that it was only \"for now.\" You can view all CloudFlare country blocks by visiting [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3713445]this thread[/url] (though Pakistan has not yet been removed-- perhaps it only is temporary).\n\n[color=white][b]143 to be Sold[/b][/color]\nAfter being the last officially purchasable group on HF, 143 is officially closing its doors and looking to sell.

Cody, a former leader/co-owner of the group, disclosed that there's been an offer by a member for $6,100 all ready and that's likely who it's going to be sold to. No official sales threads regarding the group have been made yet, though I'm sure plenty of offers have been made upon release of such information.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iyobmhGt2yol0.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][b]Morchid[/b][/url] hit 20k posts!\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=263250][color=#0066FF][b]~Tom~[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation!\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=805825][b]- Sam -[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=398194][b]Tyler‌[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=398783][color=#0066FF][b]inxy[/b][/color][/url] all hit 10k posts!\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Repfucks[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1756844][color=black][b]Z‎‎‏‍‎‏‎‏‍‎‎‏‍‎‏[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1791844][color=black][b]๖ۣۜUltimo[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=449192][color=black][b]hardcode[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=620668][color=black][b]Renowned[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Active Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1756844][color=black][b]Z‎‎‏‍‎‏‎‏‍‎‎‏‍‎‏[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reputation abuse.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1039142][color=black][b]Baby Penguin[/b][/color][/url] was banned for flaming.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1600147][color=black][b]Divert[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reputation abuse.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=11953][color=black][b]Nyx-[/b][/color][/url] was banned for low quality posting.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1791844][color=black][b]๖ۣۜUltimo[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reputation abuse.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=449192][color=black][b]hardcode[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reputation abuse.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=620668][color=black][b]Renowned[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reputation abuse.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087653][color=black][b]Ramisme[/b][/color][/url] was banned for low quality posting.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=895362][color=black][b]Prevent[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=black][b]Raptor.[/b][/color][/url] were banned for assisting a ban evader.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Expired Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=664032][color=#0066FF][b]Water Aura[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Vacations[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=587939][b]Sejskaler[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=793351][color=black][b]Enterprise[/b][/color][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=944024][color=black][b]Neal Caffrey[/b][/color][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237824][b]Perfect Cell[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1034038][color=black][b]AveSec[/b][/color][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1189774][color=black][b]Bandors[/b][/color][/url]\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Closures[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1819968][color=#383838][b]Flaaffy[/b][/color][/url] was closed.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1585387][color=#383838][b]regexks_[/b][/color][/url] was closed.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Awards[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815][color=#0066FF][b]#Nate[/b][/color][/url] purchased himself the Gift award.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=805825][b]- Sam -[/b][/url] purchased the Bitcoinage award.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828][b]Teh Afro[/b][/url] purchased the Bitcoinage award.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][b]AlbinoShadow[/b][/url] received the Cat Lover award.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=811504][color=#0066FF][b]eKKiM[/b][/color][/url] purchased the Bitcoinage, Master Donator and the Gift award.\n[/list]\n[align=right][size=x-small][color=white][b]*[/b][/color] -

Today we will be interviewing mad76e, a skilled guy in Wifi Hacking. Before we start, do you have any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: First off, I want to tell you that it's an honor to be choosen for this interview. Thank you! I would like to give a shout out to The Brotherhood.. Love you guys! And also to all noobs out there. Just keep on studying and do your best, both the school and in the type of hacking you have chosen.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: How did you stumble upon Hack Forums in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: It's a little funny story actually. The first time I stumbled HF was around 2010-2011. At that time I worked in a IP-telephony company as a support technician and wanted to prove to one of my friends how easy it was to eavesdrop a call from a IP-telephone with a MITM solution. This was the first time I encountered HF. The next time I stumbled on HF was when somebody I trusted sent me an disguised RAT. I registered here in Autumn 2012.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: What sections do you like the most on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: Wifi WPA WEP Bluetooth 4G LTE Wireless Hacking, as you probably figured out. But I also visit Pentesting and Forensics, Member Contests, and finally the Brotherhood section\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any goals for the future (forum-related)?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: Well, continue to be a good friend/helper, and slowly but surely becoming the one that others look up to and perhaps to be role model for others! Also I have some thoughts on writing a book on Wifi Hacking and sell it here, we'll see about that..\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: How many tutorials have you made for HF? Are they all related to WiFi hacking?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: Nine so far. All are related to Wifi hacking or \"long range wifi\", perhaps I might find some time to write something diffrent than wifi related topics later.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Tell us about yourself IRL. What hobbies do you have and how old are you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: Well, I'm 36 years old. I have 2 childen and a lovely wife.. (yeah, I know im a old fossil). I like to travel, love beer, and being with my friends. I am a tech geek, but a poor one. I will always have the latest gizmos.. it usually ends with me getting a second hand gadget that I'll have to modify it until I'm get satisfied.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Give us an example of a gagdet that you'd modify.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: Well.. I needed a decent laptop a year ago.. My hopes were that I would have money to buy a HP or an ASUS with the latest prcessor (Intel Core i5) and around 4gig in ram and 15,6 \" screen. And ended with a PackardBell 1gig ram  and a Atom  (N2600) and 10.1 screen.. Or that time I wanted a Experia S mobile phone, cos my old one broke, but the economy was stretched out and I was forced to buy a sony ericsson X10i, and had to install cyanmod if I wanted to show myself in public without being as ashamed lol\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Did you expect getting where you are today when you joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: No, not really. In the beginning it was all about learning new tings especially with RATs, but I got bored after a few days :D.  RATs did not feel like hacking but more as a a logical bomb needed to be spread around. Also to be able to join a group as an regular user was an honor, and then get to be with you guys in a group was not on the map in the beginning. I have a lot to be thankful for.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: We invite those who we deem worthy; which you are! Anyways, thanks for participating in this interview. Any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1491834][b]mad76e[/b][/url]: Well... See you all out there and thanks for the interview!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: I recommend that everyone takes a look at mad76e's tutorials by clicking [url=http://hackforums.net/search.php?action=finduserthreads&uid=1491834][b]here[/b][/url].[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771]Vinnie'[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 161st version of the HF news. Today we're interviewing Vinnie, proud owner of #@&%! (Instinct), and gaming enthusiast. Before we begin do you have any shoutouts you'd like to give?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] Yo, I'd like to give a shoutout to all the members of my group & everyone on HackerCraft.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure they'll be glad to read that. So what are your hobbies outside of HF, besides raking in the dough, of course?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest all I do is work for these Korean & Russian guys that contacted me on HF, at first I thought they were feds but this one day I went on his computer via TV and it felt like I just walked past the Korean borderline, that's how I earn my money and they bought me my group, other than that all I do is hang out in my TeamSpeak and play games such as LoL & MC with friends and some close friends of mine.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I can honestly say that's the most intersting story I've heard in a while. Was it scary when they first contacted you? Did you think they were feds?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] No, it was lulzy. I was in TeamSpeak with Who?, KMS, Scott Thomas (some other skidhackers) & Aush0k when I was contacted first, so we started doing a background check on this guy's LR ID and it ended up leading back to an \"FBI\" report from about a year ago. At this time it was a little too late for me to back out as I had already accepted $12,500LR from him for a job + $4550 for WiFi Gang which was purchased a few days before we started the background check.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I think we're all beginning to see why you have that shady Black Hatter award, now, aren't we? Speaking of the purchase of your group, what made you decide on the name Legacy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] Well, me, Apple J4ck & Stay [i]Pigeon[/i] were thinking of names for the group that would fit it well. So Stay Plural suggested the name Legacy and I suggested Defcon and Apple J4ck was neutral towards both names. Long story short, Omniscient denied the name Defcon due to the hacking convention that's held in Vegas, so we decided to go with Legacy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed, a suitable name for a bunch of gamers. So as a lot of us know, you were forced to change the name (Legacy), correct? Give us the quick rundown on that story.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] Well technically I wasn't forced to change the name, but I wasn't allowed to have any products under the name Legacy due to the brand LegacyWARE. I don't know how on earth they copyrighted a name on a forum without the license though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] And thus #@?&%! was born. Probably the most original group name on the forum by far. What made you pick that name as oppose to the others suggested?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] Before that name was picked you have no idea how hard I tried to fight for the name Legacy back... Everything was set and accepted but the transfer of this so called Copyright was transferred to Adam the reseller of LegacyWARE even though the owner gave us permisison to use it still Omniscient didn't give us the go. Anyway moving on, we couldn't get a name to match the name Legacy and just near the end I gave up and said fuck it let's go with symbols, no other group has that yet, people can call the group whatever they way, a Legacy revamp, Instinct w/e they want.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Just goes to show it's not about the name, but what the group stands for. So now that there's two gaming groups, are there any feuds between Instinct and Skill that the public doesn't really know about?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] I don't think both groups should be fighting against each other to become the best instead they should be competing against each other and giving the gaming community some action. StarStruck knows of this, we're trying to amend things that Platinum caused, that's what started this rivalry and that is exactly why I don't allow Skill members in my group, once again none of this is because of StarStruck.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed. Lately I've seen a lot of Skill members leave to become members of #@?&%! (Instinct). Do you treat those members any differently because they once resented you, or are they one in the same?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url]  Nope, the ones that were in Legacy get an invite back if they want in. Although I've had a lot of Skill members ask to join but I've declined them so I'm not really transferring them like most people think.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So the notorious Instict vs. Skill tournemnet is today (Sept. 22, 2013) Do you have anything to say to the members of Skill or Instinct about the friendly competition\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, as a matter of fact I do. I don't think it's going to happen, we're here suited and booted waiting on Skill but so far there's no reply. I really hope we can get this done today, the day that Starstruck was free and not busy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'm playing on Team Instinct for the Halo tournament, so I hope everything falls through. What do you predict will be the outcome of the tournament? We have some really skilled players, and I know they do too.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] I really hope we can get this going ASAP as it's the first day of my uni course tomorrow (GF 5 years of lyfe) as after that I probably won't have time... Anyway, I think Skill will be a tough battle when playing against them on Halo but when it comes to BOII for the Xbox 360 we've got the best players on the forum, shoutout le nublet Cloudy who has organized both teams, League of legends is our game. Me and Sam will do some damage and cannot wait to play.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#7BFF00][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] It's been a pleasure interviewing you, Vinnie. We got to know a lot about you that I'm sure not too many people knew about previously. Any closing statements?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=white][b]Vinnie:[/b][/color][/url] Cats 4 lyfe.[/spoiler]",

GTA V reached this milestone faster than any other game and movie in history. Call of Duty: Black Ops II took 15 days to reach $1 billion, while The Avengers movie took 19 days. \"Grand Theft Auto is a cultural phenomenon and Rockstar Games continues to redefine what can be achieved in interactive entertainment,\" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a statement. \"We are incredibly proud of the extraordinary critical and commercial response to Grand Theft Auto V.\" GTA V broke entertainment sales records which was only available on Xbox 360 and PS3. However, according to a game analyst, Rockstar Games will release GTA V on next-generation in 2014. Rockstar has not made an official response regarding this. GTA Online will launch on October 1st - now, what are you still doing here?

This year we’ve been working on even more ways to connect the dots for customers who want Steam in the living-room. Soon, we’ll be adding you to our design process, so that you can help us shape the future of Steam.\n[/quote]\nA Valve rep confirmed on Twitter that the company will make three announcements during the week that will make steam more accessible. As of this article, only one announcement has been dated with the other two TBA. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThe concept behind FilmSpeed - Forza Motorsport 5.\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R34lrTPGFY[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Minecraft 1.6.4 Released[/color][/b]\nThough with nothing specifically stated in [url=www.mcupdate.tumblr.com]Minecraft's update logs[/url], Mojang recently pushed the release of 1.6.4. Nothing has really been substantially noticed, though one can only assume that they addressed any bugs that they could find with quick fixes to them. Surely the patch didn't take too long to push as much work is being put into their upcoming patch, 1.7; expect that one to come out sooner than later (with actual updates too), at that.\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft Skin Scanner for iOS[/color][/b]\nMojang has finally released an innovative way to create skins to your own liking in an easily accessible way. With the upcoming release of their new app to iOS, Minecraft Skin Scanner, players all over will be able to print a template, color in their skins in whichever way they want, and then scan it with their iDevice. Mojang released a trailer for said app and you can view it in the spoiler below.\n\n[spoiler=Minecraft Skin Scanner App Trailer][video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jF6B1shE510[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot: 13w38a[/color][/b]\nWith the release of the newest snapshot, 13w38a, Mojang has stated that in addition to some graphic fixes and crash fixes, there has been something added that's \"super secret\" and for users to find out. With their mention of the release in a blog post, they also included a seemingly blurred-out image to go along with it; you can view it in the spoiler below.\n\n[spoiler=Blurredout image][img]http://i.imgur.com/i3axTQ3.png[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b] [list]\n[*]Two popular factions, Chad and Instinct, have gone back and forth raiding one another.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][b]SoulZeh[/b][/url] was promoted to moderator.\n[*]Instinct raided Mohatu's base.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][b]Хypher[/b][/url] was the first to reach [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3756693]$100,000 EM[/url] and was shortly followed by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1122112][b]Lonephenom™[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=805825][b]- Sam -[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]Cody‍[/b][/url].\n[*]Skill raided [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=89554][color=#0066FF][b]Sigma‎‏‍‎‏‎‏‍‎[/b][/color][/url]'s base.\n[*]Complexity (a faction representing an official HF group) is [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3756331]recruiting[/url].\n[*]Instinct raided Complexity, Skill, Infamous, and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url] (several times).\n[*]The server [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3761049]experienced some downtime[/url].\n[*]The server [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3762793]hit 50 players online at once[/url].

Navy Yard Rampage[/b][/color]\nAaron Alexis, 34, entered the Washington Navy Yard on Monday and murdered twelve civilians before being killed in a shootout with police. Alexis was a military veteran, a navy contractor, and had valid access to the base. He was armed with a shotgun and a .45-caliber handgun. A month prior to the incident, Alexis contacted officers about pursuers who harassed him with a microwave machine. “[H]e had heard voices speaking to him through the wall, flooring and ceiling,” a police report said (via [url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/washington-navy-yard-shootings.html?pagewanted=all]The New York Times[/url]).\nAlexis received an honorable discharge in January 2011 after various instances of non-violent insubordination. He was later investigated for several shooting-related incidents one when he shot the a ceiling and another when he shot the tires of a car. Alexis suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by volunteering in the rescue effort after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, his father told police.\n\n[color=white][b]Colorado Flooding Unleashes Oil into Surrounding Area[/b][/color]\nNearly 5.5 thousand gallons of crude oil spilled from tanks owned by Anadarko Petroleum into the Colorado South Platte River after being damaged by flood waters that claimed many lives last week. County authorities announced that at least one other oil pipeline had broken, however they did not delve into further details. The State of Colorado has [url=http://www.helpcoloradonow.net/]set up an official website[/url] for people to help the communities affected by the recent disaster.\n\n[color=white][b]President Obama Waives Ban on Arming Terrorists Groups in Syria[/b][/color]\nUnited States President Obama announced Tuesday that he was waiving the ban that would prevent providing arms and materials to Syrian opposition groups, several which are classified as terrorist organizations. Authority to perform such an action is granted to the President by the Arms Export Control Act if he determines that it is necessary for national security.\nThe U.S. National Security Council released a statement explaining that the move was to allow the U.S. Government to provide “non-lethal assistance” such as equipment, medicine, and training to protect against chemical weapons.\n\n[color=white][b]Kanzlerin Merkel Wins Third Term as German Chancellor[/b][/color]\nAngela Merkel won a clear victory as conservative voters lined the polls this weekend. This election will grant Merkel, the first female chancellor, a third term in office and possibly an absolute majority for her political party, the Christian Democratic Union. The CDU received 42% of votes, an 8.2% increase over the 2009 elections.\nThe liberal Free Democratic Party suffered a humiliating defeat with only 4.7% of the vote, a 9.9% decrease. Senior FDP member Christian Linder noted, “This is the FDP's bitterest defeat in decades” (via [url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/merkel-wins-third-term-in-general-election-exit-polls-suggest-a-923755.html]Der Spiegel[/url]).\nGerman Chancellors serve 4 year terms, and there is no limit on number of terms that can be served. The longest serving post-World War II Chancellor was Helmut Kohl who served 4 terms between 1982 and 1998.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]AirPlay Mirroring Coming To Android Through CyanogenMod[/b][/color]\nKoushik Dutta, the Vice President of Engineering for CyanogenMod, recently posted a demonstration of him using his Android to stream to an Apple TV. He has been said to have been working on Android streaming to most devices for a while. That being said, there have already been apps in the market that allow you to stream to Apple TV already, but incorporating it into the OS will make it a bit easier.\n\n[color=white][b]Verizon FiOS Mobile App Now Allows TV Streaming[/b][/color]\nThe official FiOS mobile app has officially updated and now allows live TV streaming anywhere. Before this had happened, users could only stream when connected to the home network, however this latest update changes this. If you have iOS or Android, you can watch your TV on the go. As of right now, there aren't that many channels supported, but FiOS plans to add more soon.\n\n[color=white][b]BlackBerry cuts 4,500 Jobs, Loses Over $950 Million[/b][/color]\nThere have been some rumors floating around about how BlackBerry is going to have a massive layoff. This week, that rumor comes to fruition as they prepare to layoff about 4,500 employees. They have announced that they are planning to do this to reduce operation expenditures. Such comes after the company recently had a net operating loss of $950 million due to the failure of the Z10. \n\n[color=white][b]Valve Planning Big Announcement On 9/23[/b][/color]\nValve has recently teased a big announcement coming on September 23rd. The teaser site is vague at best. The site has a countdown timer and a paragraph of text hinting towards a beta test of some sort. Many speculate this will be the announcement of the Steambox, which is Valve’s small gaming computer.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Justin Timberlake Releases New Single.[/b][/color]\nJustin Timberlake officially released his second single from [i]The 20/20 Experience - 2 of 2[/i] out on September 20, 2013. It all started with a tweet JT published asking, \"Should I release a new single today???\", many demanded he should and with that he released \"TKO\" after teasing his fans for 12 hours. The track features Timbaland, with signature bleepy production and dark undertones, a huge jump from the album's lead single: upbeat throwback/retro jam \"Take Back the Night.\" Hear the song for yourself by clicking [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJydK_V-7Ws][i]here[/i][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]The Weeknd Comes in Second in Billboard Battle with Keith Urban.[/b][/color]\nCritics and fans alike were sure that singer Abel Tesfaye, or the [i]Weeknd[/i], was going to debut at number one after much praise for his newest album, [i]Kissland[/i]. [i]Kissland[/i] sold about 95,000 copies falling short of just a few thousand to country singer Keith Urban, whose album \"Fuse\" sold over 98,000 copies. Shortly after hearing the news the [i]Weekend[/i] tweeted out, \"AWWH. SO CLOSE THEY HAD TO RECOUNT!!! STILL GOT THE BEST FANS!! THANK YOU XO\", jokingly mentioning that there should be a recount. At least this time a different Canadian topped the charts.\n\n[color=white][b]Katy Perry Listens to Drake When Making Out.[/b][/color]\nThat's right, Katy Perry's preferred choice is Drake when it comes to making out with boyfriend John Mayer. Mentioning, \"Drake is so sensitive but yet still so cool. It's a very hard balance to find sometimes. Emotional guys that are sensitive but strong and Drake is definitely that kind of guy. And he really hit home for on this next one called 'Hold On.' I think it's beautiful. It sounds a little bit like kind of old vibey Lionel Richie [or] The Weeknd. It's sexy as hell,\" Perry said. \"And I listen to it with my boyfriend [John Mayer], so I would suggest listening to it with whoever you wanna make out with,\" during her iTunes radio guest DJ stint. She even went on to say that Miguel's songs turn her on and into the mood. Don't forget Katy Perry has a wheelchair fetish in which she likes having sex while she's seated on a wheelchair. Just imagine Katy Perry seated in a wheelchair having sex all while listening to Drake.\n\n[color=white][b]Tupac Finally Gets His Own Movie.[/b][/color]\nBiggie, 50 Cent, Eminem, it's about time Tupac gets a movie based on his life. The Tupac Shakur biopic from Morgan Creek Productions is finally moving forward with Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films—with an estimated $45 million budget. According to Deadline, the film will begin production in 2014 in Atlanta. The movie will be called simply [i]Tupac[/i] and Afeni Shakur, his mother, will be the executive producer. Afeni Shakur originally sued Morgan Creek Productions after not giving her creative control. Tupac already has a broadway musical called \"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" based on a \"unconditional love story\" with an \"anti-violence\" message according to director Kenny Leon.\n\nThis week's music videos were chosen by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=837416]Soulmate[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1445026]Tilt[/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1532144]K.ing[/url].

Throughout my career on Hack Forums, I've made some real friends and connections to people that I know I can rely on--both in the business world and the personal world. Although my network has begun to die due to the resignation and inactivity of my golden-days buddies, I will always have those few that I expect to stay in contact with for many years to come. Some say that \"it's not what you know, but who you know,\" and I wouldn't contest that quote too heavily. Having a contact list full of people from around the world--skilled in numerous areas--has gotten me out of many a tight spot and opened limitless opportunities. While there are those who abuse Hack Forums, there are some really talented people lurking among the trolls, lounge-goers, marketers, and general posters. Get to know a few people, you probably won't regret it--unless you're fucking with those \"hackers,\" they're a shady bunch ;P",

That's a question not commonly \nasked on HF, and when it is, some mentor closes it for whatever \nreason. There is good qualities and bad qualities about EVERY staff \nmember. On feedback threads people just list the good qualities.. \nbecause they thing bad things will happen it they say bad things \nabout staff members which wont. Everyone is entitled to there opinion. \nI will list some of these bad qualities, then pick my favorite staff member. \nLets start with the new recruit, D3xus. Seems like a nice guy, gave me \na wrongful warning once and revoked it, is nice enough in PM's and does \nhis job. Don't really have anything negative about him. Next lets talk \nabout Paradoxum. Almost everyone thinks this guy is the best staff \nmember, I for one, do not. User has never given me warnings, so I \ndon't have experience with that, but I have asked him some questions \nsometimes, and he simple posts the link to Omniscient profile. Doesn't \neven say \"ask him\" just posts his profile link. If your staff you should \nanswer me questions, not busy Omniscient. One time I made a sarcastic \njoke and he threatened to forward it to Omniscient, that's just mean. \nNext we have Chris. I see your name your name in bans.php sometimes, \nbut I don't have much experience with you. And you cant forget Judge \nDredd .. I am too new of a member to really experience his time being \nAdmin and running rep abuse and such, but a former staff member has \neven told me he abused his position for economical gain... so I am not \nsure what to think of him. And also, if your staff members should be \nable to send you PM's asking you questions. Why do you have it so \npeople not on your buddylist cant send PM's? So I immediately have \na negative opinion on him. In my opinion, D3Xus is the best staff member.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1759389][i]-Tᴇɴᴀxɪᴜᴍ[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think Judge Dredd was and still is my favorite staff \nmember by far! I've never spoken to a more genuine guy! Although \nwe have only briefly spoken, he always has a calm nature about him, \nwith an ever-watching eye over HF. His efforts a lot of the time, for \na lot of people, were taken for granted when he ran the rep abuse \nsystem. It's hard for someone to do something like that and keep up \nwith demand. Now, I guess as a regular staff member, he's slowly \nslipped away into the background, but not to fear JD, you're still \nappreciated! The rest of the staff, of course are just as appreciated, \nbut JD really is the bawmb.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=823754][i]-McDork[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"My favorite staff member there ever was, has to be Wolves. I've \nhad the pleasure to talk to him quite a few times in the not so official \nHF tinychat room The Lounge. He is an amazing guy, absolutely down \nto earth, yet extremely efficient as well as talented. He is the kind of \nguy you want to be your neighbor, I wouldn't doubt on his abilities any \nday, yet you know he never goes up on a cloud because he was promoted. \nHe's what I would like to see more HF members achieve to become. I know \nthat I at least wan't to try to achieve some of that down to earth ability \nthat he has. It's just so cool to see people who can keep being themselves \nat times like those. If anyone I wish Wolves would be a staff forever again.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=770060][i]-Invisus[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"D3xus has always been a problem solver for me. I am very \npleased that he is finally full staff, and he completely deserves it. I wish \nhis the best of luck, and I will always come to him with any problem that \nrequires staff.
