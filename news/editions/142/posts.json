There is no real understanding of why this happened but [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made a thread about it. All that was said by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] himself is that people have overlooked this situation and that it isn't as dramatic as many of you may think. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] had stated that he will not discuss this incident because it's simply not anyone's business. He has also said that he is very sad to see JD go, but their friendship will remain strong. For those wondering, the duties of MOTM have been handed over to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=646916][b]Genuine[/b][/url], and the role of reputation abuse will be followed up.\n\n[color=white][b]New User Award Added[/b][/color]\nA new award has been added, called Bitcoinage, which is pretty self explanatory. In only a few days this award has been handed out to quite a few people. You can obtain this award by donating one Bitcoin to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url].

The new group is called Complexity, with the description \"Complexity focuses on the intricate details surrounding the complexities of coding, web design and security. Our aim is to understand and to improve. We start with ourselves and expand to others as we expand to GFX design, monetizing, gaming and most computer related topics.\".\n\n[color=white][b]New Server Stress Testing Rule[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has released a new Server Stress Testing rule. All stressers are required to blacklist the domain hackforums.net from being DDoSed. Can't wait to see if checks are done, and stressers don't have that function. This is to prevent attacks on Hack Forums after the current downtime or node that was attacked at HF.\n\n[color=white][b]Crypto Currency Forum Added[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has released a new forum called [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=277][b]Crypto Currency[/b][/url], this is for LiteCoins, BitCoins and so forth.

Before we start, I'm sure you'll have a couple shout outs to make.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to give a shoutout to a very close friend. Doctor Blue! He's a good guy, with a lot of knowledge, and we and him got a very close connection. One of the best people on HF to be honest. Also some nice words about Guardians and The Empire members: You guys rock!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] How are you doing on this fine day Mr. Snorlax?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty good! Our booter sales went very good while I was asleep, but I have a lot of homework that has to be done, so my support guy has to take care of the support tickets unfortunately. But everything is good, and my life is perfect right now! 😁\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] How and when did you find HF? What made you join?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] I found Hack Forums when I wanted to hack my old school's website. I remember one of my first threads was something like \"how to hack .aspx website\".. Pretty funy 😝 - I believe I found it through Google by searching \"how to hack\" or something like that. I now know how stupid that was, and I regret making that thread haha.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I also see that you have experience in the Marketplace. What do you think about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] The marketplace is filled up with the same stuff. Once in a while I get to see something new, but it's mostly VPNs and booters I care about. Sometimes I find something unique, which I've never seen before, and therefore I like to look further into that. I'm not much of a person who hangs around the marketplace a lot, but sometimes I'll find myself buying something that I don't really need, and then regret it the second after I've bought it. I should be more careful with my money to be honest 😝 But to be honest, it's a nice section. Not too much crap in there, and it's being monitored well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any goals you would like to achieve on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] Of course I do! Who doesn't haha. My goal is to become a mentor, but I'm 99.9% sure it won't happen. I'm sure many people have the same dream as me, but HF is a place I spend 90% of my day. I'm ALWAYS online when I'm at my PC, so I'm pretty much into Hack Forums. You could say that haha. One day I might change, but it's not going to be soon!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] There's been a lot of drama lately on HF. What is your view on that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] There's always drama on Hack Forums. Every community has its drama days, and if it doesn't involve me, I couldn't care much to be honest. With all the drama around the members, I just want to say; Stay strong and keep calm. Same goes to all the haters. Keep calm. I'm happy to see some new staff members (hi kewl), but it's sad to see JD got demoted. I'm sure the drama will stop eventually.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I see you work on a Stresser. What do you have to say about Omni's new policy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest, it's 50/50 good and bad. I wanted to create a giveaway in the Member Contest section, but it got closed because it's violating his new policy. I believe a lot of sales will go down, but it's hard to say, because I'm a new owner. However, our sales are going excellent, so I can't complain about it. I think his policy is good in a way, because when I went to some marketplace sections, I hated that all I saw was booters. Stressers all over Hack Forums really. I'm glad it's more sorted now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] It's true that many shitty booters were coming out every day. Do you have an IRL job? If not, is your booter your only source of income?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] I don't have an IRL job (yet). My booter is my only income, and hopefully I will get some good cash out of it. So far it's going great, and I've met a lot of new people, who's up for some marketing. We'll see, maybe I won't need a job? 😎\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Only time can tell. Anyways, I'd also like to hear your opinion on a controversial topic: Complexity. What do you think about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] I think it's a sweet group. I love the idea behind it. Webmasters, coding, GFX designs, monetizing, gaming and computing is definately a group I'd like to be in. They're all topics involving Hack Forums sections, so I'm sure that JD, bugga and ShadowCloud will make something neat for each section. Maybe each section will finally have a \"THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO __\" soon. Yeah, \"only time can tell\". I wish them the best of luck with the group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for taking part in my interview, Snorlax. I wish you best of luck with everything you take on! Any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=white][b]'Snorlax:[/b][/color][/url] No no! Thank you, Connected! Final words.. hmm. <3 to all the staffs and mentors right now. Wisely chosen and the best of the best!\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590]Mr. Donuts[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Hello! Today, for the 142nd edition of the News, we are having an interview with the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590]Mr. Donuts[/url]! Before we begin, do you have any shoutouts you would like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to give a shoutout to Vincenzio, for being an amazing and nice group leader, Yuno, for playing all kinds of games with me and helping me throughout my time on HackForums. I would also like to give a shoutout to Sir for being a great leader of the HF news team. Last but not least, I would like to give a shoutout to a great mentor, Positive. He's always there, locking threads, answering my PM's, and being kind to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome. I'm sure they'll be extremely glad to hear the shoutout from you. Anyway, onto our first question. What made you join Hack Forums in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] Well, one day, I started looking for \"Minecraft Hacked Clients\" and I found a majority of them on HackForums.net. So I decided to register on this website so I could see the screenshots and download to the hacked client.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. I believe Minecraft & griefing has caused various individuals to sign up to the site, myself included. Did you have any key influences at the beginning of your HF career?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] Positive was always there to help me with any problems I encountered. The Empire memebers were always around, free to help me with anything that I needed; Same goes for 143. Overall, they all impacted me because after watching how they behaved and acted around the forum I decided to change my ways and so I generally acted much more respectfully towards other users, and I attempted to help members out with whatever they needed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Wow! I can honestly say I'm very glad they did influence you so much because you're such a helpful person around the forum! Next question, what made you stay on the forums, and what kept you interested throughout your career on the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] The sheer activity of the members of the forum made me stay. I had so many questions that I needed to ask but I could never find any answers to them. Now that I'm a member of the forum I can ask all the questions I need and I always know I'll get detailed responses that almost always perfect and provide the information I was looking for.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I see you've recently become a member of the Legacy group. How is it going for you as a part of the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] The group is amazing. It's very active, especially the lounge inside the subforum. There's always members telling me tips and tricks with the same I'm having hard a hard time with. I share the knowledge that I have picked up while gaming by teaching others important aspects of various games I consider myself to be more active in.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I'm glad to hear that you contribute well to the group! But being in the group Legacy you must be a gamer. What games do you play most? What do you like about them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] The game that I enjoy most is \"Minecraft\" I love how creative you can get with the game. There's many aspects in the game, and you can make many new friends with people who enjoy the game. I made many friends from this game and I have helped many others. This game was my first online game I've ever played. I bought Minecraft when it was in beta 1.7 since then I've done many achievments throughout the game. I enjoy playing Minecraft a lot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Very nice. I myself am too a Minecraft player, I've also played it since the mid-late Beta stages. I used to love the game but it's lost it's original spark that I used to really enjoy. For someone wanting to join Legacy, could you offer any words of advice?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] Be helpful, be active in the gaming sections, make your application lengthy, be helpful, and make your application unique. It's important you go into detail as to why the group should add you and how you will contribute to the group, or else you'll probably not be a part of the members who do get recruited.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure many members will be thankful for those tips you've generously provided us all with. I've seen your activity in the griefing section, what makes you enjoy being a part of the griefing community? Many other users on the site stay clear of the section, but clearly you do enjoy spending time in it.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] What makes me enjoy being in the griefing community? Well, I like to put abusive staff to the end. They deserve to get their servers griefed because they treat their community/players wrongly. It's horrible, so I decided to mess up what they've created because they deserve it. They abuse rules, people, power, and commands. It's not right.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for letting me interview you, I'm sure this will be an interesting read for those who keep up with the News! Any last words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1201590][color=white][b]Mr. Donuts:[/b][/color][/url] Without the MC griefing section, I would've never register on HackForums.net and thanks for interviewing me, it means a lot.\n[/spoiler]",

      "message": "[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G2vt.jpg[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Snapshot 13w19a[/color][/b]\nThis week's snapshot adds some new changes which build upon the features included in previous snapshots. First of all, some new aesthetics were implemented into the game; coal blocks as well as Lapis Lazuli blocks were completely retextured, and charcoal now has a different skin than coal. Hardened clay, which was implemented last week, now comes in all colors of the rainbow; it can be dyed just like wool (however resulting in a duller color), and it brings a new alternative for colored wool. Another notable change is that donkeys now feature working inventories; pressing shift+right click while pointing at a donkey will bring up the new donkey inventory box! And last but not least, mobs now spawn in groups again. The full [url=http://mojang.com/2013/05/minecraft-snapshot-13w19a/]changelog[/url] for this snapshot includes: \n[list]\n[*]Added new stained hardened clay.\n[*]Enabled access to the donkey & mule inventories by sneaking and interacting.\n[*]New textures for Charcoal, Coal Block and Lapis Lazuli.\n[*]Made mobs spawn as groups again.\n[*]Minecarts with Furnace consume coal in creative mode\n[*]After the last use of a bow you get a glitch bow that when dropped and picked up again duplicates\n[*]Coal blocks do not burn away\n[*]Blurred menu background textures\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=#9400D3]Hacker[/color][color=#32CD32]craft [/color][color=white]Reset and Possible Revival[/color][/b]\nThe Hackercraft server was once active and alive with a large playerbase consisting mostly of players from Hack Forums. A few months ago, however, activity on the server died down due to multiple reasons; because of the drop in Hackercraft activity, most players from the server turned to Planet Beacon instead. Recently Omniscient has found new interest in Hackercraft, appointing a new Hackercraft admin and resetting the empty server's map, clearing everything; the economy as well as player inventories were completely wiped as well. Following these changes, Omniscient has recently announced that factions may be removed! Not much has been announced, however apparently he wants a more peaceful server; factions can and have, after all, cause a lot of hostility between players. These new changes have brought a little activity back to Hackercraft. Could this mean the server has a chance of revival? The server only hits around twenty players per day at peak, however the activity is fairly consistent and definitely an improvement over zero players per day. If you'd like to see the new changes for yourself, log into [color=white]play.hackercraft.net[/color] or [color=white]play2.hackercraft.net[/color], and be sure to visit the HackerCraft subforum for more info!\n\n[b][color=#87CEEB]PlanetBeacon[/color][color=white] News:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Sacred has managed to obtain the only legitimate dragon egg on the server; nice job!\n[*]Demented is now recruiting\n[*]ChefHOU and Chris are now besties4lyf\n[*]Drugs raided Terminators\n[/list]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1MM.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Ouya Retail Launch Delayed[/b][/color]\nThe OUYA console has been delayed to June 25th. It was originally set for June 4th, however the company revealed in a press conference that the decision was a measure of keeping up with retail demand. CEO Julie Uhrman explained the date shift \"will allow us to create more units and, basically, have more units on store shelves.\" OUYA Inc. also said that they are altering existing controller button holes to ensure buyers don't come upon a sticking issue that Kickstarter backers have been experiencing. \"We made that change very early so all the units are being produced with those larger button holes,\" she said. Uhrman didn't say whether early backers will receive a replacement controller which fixes the sticky issue. \n\n[color=white][b]More Destiny Details[/b][/color]\nThe official Destiny website has been updated by Bungie, revealing a lot more information about the game including in-game classes and the game's universe. Warlock, Titan and Hunter are available classes in-game as we can see so far.\n[b]Warlocks [/b]- \"Warlocks have long studied the Traveler, mastering some of its arcane energies. Its true purpose still remains a great mystery, but discovering truth has always driven you into the unknown. Now, our enemies are the only thing that stands between you and the lost wonders of our Golden Age.\"\n[b]Titans [/b]- The first Titans built the Wall, and gave their lives to defend it. Now, you stand in the same high place, steadfast and sure, protecting all who shelter in your shadow. You hail from a long line of heroes, forged from strength and sacrifice. Our enemies may be deadly and merciless, but so are you.\"\n[b]Hunters[/b] - \"Hunters once prowled the wilderness and wastelands, taking big risks for even bigger rewards. You're no outlaw—at least, not anymore—but making your own luck has always meant bending the rules. Your unique brand of daring and ingenuity is needed now more than ever.\"\nAlong with these classes, Bungie also added pages about the universe/locations. Abandoned Earth and the Moon have been detailed on the website, however information for Mars and Venus remains MIA. Destiny is currently in development for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and the next-generation Xbox. No release date has been announced.\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Xbox Games[/b][/color]\n[b]May 14, 2013[/b] - Metro: Last Light\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Fast & Furious: Showdown\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Resident Evil: Revelations\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - Fuse\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - GRID 2\n[b]Jun 04, 2013[/b] - Painkiller: Hell & Damnation\n[b]Jun 04, 2013[/b] - Remember Me\n[b]Jun 11, 2013[/b] - Dark\n[b]Jun 25, 2013[/b] - Deadpool\n[b]Jun 25, 2013[/b] - Ride to Hell: Retribution\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThis week's video is a Feeding Frenzy Rage Quit from RoosterTeeth. I really didn't know anyone could rage as hard as Michael in this kids game.\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R18ByTVOyXM[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1N5.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]World Health Organization Warns of Deadly New Virus\n[/b][/color]The Coronavirus is a new highly contagious virus that has several confirmed cases, all of which are in critical state. According to the Saudi health ministry, 15 people have died out of the 24 diagnosed cases since last summer. The Coronavirus causes respiratory infections in both animals and humans and it is not yet clear whether or not this virus can be transferred from animals to humans.\n\n[color=white][b]Mother’s Day Parade Shooting\n[/b][/color]12 people have been reported shot during a Mother’s Day parade in New Orleans. No deaths have been reported, however the victims of the shooting included a 10-year-old girl who suffered minor wounds. The shooter(s) have not yet been found but police are combing the area.\n\n[color=white][b]Bodies Found After Hostage Standoff in New Jersey\n[/b][/color]Bodies were found after a 37 hour long standoff with an armed 38-year-old man who took three hostages in New Jersey. Gerald Murphy barricaded himself and three children inside a house since Friday died after being shot. The bodies of a woman and her 13-year-old son were found in the house. Gerald Murphy had previous criminal records which included robbery and weapons offenses.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Ns.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]YouTube Introduces Subscription Fees[/b][/color]\nA select few channels are now a part of a trial of YouTube's new subscription-based content service. Subscriptions will start form as little as $0.99 USD a month with a 14 day trial along with discounted annual fees. I personally believe that this was inevitable and I'm surprised it's taken so long for it to happen! I suppose it sort of adds pressure on content makers to make sure what they're putting out is their best, thus increasing the quality of content for the viewer. I just hope there will still be enough of an incentive for those to create free videos that are just as good.\n\n[color=white][b]Sony Makes a Profit for the First Time in Five Years![/b][/color]\nYou may think that a huge tech company such as Sony would be reeling in the profits, well, you'd be wrong. Sony has reported that for the first time in five years, they have made an annual profit. The net profit posted on 31st March was the equivalent of around $436m. Sony commented saying that this was due to the fall of the yen, making goods cheaper for people buying abroad, in turn boosting sales.\n\n[color=white][b]Syrian Internet Blackout[/b][/color]\nSyria faced a 19 hour full internet blackout. Syrian authorities are blaming the down-time on a cable fault, yet critics argue that this was a tactical move to stunt the opposing government's online operations and activities.\n\n[color=white][b]Spotify Fixes Free Download Vulnerability[/b][/color]\nA recent vulnerability allowed users to freely download music from the popular music streaming service, Spotify. An extension for Google Chrome \"Downloadify\" was created in order to exploit the Spotify web panel, enabling MP3 downloads, however was quickly removed by Google from their web store. Spotify was quick to fix the vulnerability. The service has blown up recently, boasting over 24 million active users; a quarter of which with paid subscriptions. A simple security vulnerability like this could prove fatal for such a developing company.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1NR.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Selena Gomez Calls Justin Bieber Relationship 'Crazy And Very Intense'[/b][/color]\nFor all the Jelena's out there who've been following Justin and Selena, you'll know that the two have had conflicts in the past. They've also had a few things going on for the past couple of months. One incident was Selena taking a flight to see Justin in Oslo, Norway. Another was Justin being seen with Selena as his iPhone wallpaper. The two have been going through a lot of drama, and Selena is finally fed up. She states that she does not do this for attention, but this is the outcome of most dating and relationship problems. At this very moment the two seem like they're enjoying themselves without each other. Justin and Selena are still both young, yes, and they're still learning from their mistakes. Selena has been hanging out with friends more, doing things on her own, and just living life as best as she can. She believes Justin's doing the same too. Roughly enough, Selena recorded \"Love Will Remember,\" for her 2013 album release. She states that the song she sung was inspired by her breakup. What she has to say to this is, \"That's the most personal track on the record, for sure. I think it's a sweet way of releasing it. It's not an aggressive approach to what people are probably expecting... I'm sure he'll love it too.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Lil Wayne's New Supra Line: Not a Human Shoe?[/b][/color]\nLil Wayne, the 'Martian', has been seen wearing customized shoes made by Supra. The first model being made is called the \"Chimera\" which if you didn't know, is the Greek mythological creature made up of a lion, snake and goat. Surprisingly enough, he had a party for the release of the sneakers. He invited a bunch of people he knew which consisted of skaters and other members of the hip-hop community he associated with. Wayne stated \"Supra's been down with me for a long time. Video shoots, anything I had to do, tour or whatever, they are always in support. They always send too many shoes. This was all their idea, give him his own shoe and I'm just going with it.\" The designs implemented on the shoes fit Wayne's personality and taste for shoes. The Chimera is composed of a basketball shoe look with the essentially feel for a skate sneaker. The Chimera has various different colors. Some include: Tennis ball green, black, purple giraffe and print variation. Lil Wayne wants them to be like him; different. \"I'm happy to say it's my shoe,\" is what he said about the final outcome.\n\n[color=white][b]Mac Miller + Ariana Grande Forever?[/b][/color]\nThe fabulously beautiful Ariana Grande has decided that she wanted to record a new song, \"The Way\". The song was about young love, and Ariana decided to recruit the rapping sensation, Mac Miller, to help her out. Mac Miller wanted to clear everything up and just say that the two were friends. He explained that even though they smooched a bit, it doesn't mean the two have had a love affair. In a video, Mac Miller stated, \"That's the homey. She's got a boyfriend and everything. Obviously, that [kiss] made everyone talk. I didn't even know that was going to happen and then we were shooting and the director was like 'This should happen' and I'm like 'Alright.' When I went back to my old school, elementary, middle school, the other day when I was in Pittsburgh, and everyone was freaking out like 'You kissed Ariana Grande.' I was like 'Yeah, you know how I do,' \" he was joking around when he said that. He's said some nice and charming things about her. He honestly thinks she's truly amazing at her talent which is singing. \"Well she's a very, very talented singer, like she can sing incredibly. And, that's awesome and she's a great person. She's one of the nicest just people I've ever met in my life. But, you know, that song like we did work on the studio, like other work, that was like as far as the experience was more of an experience, like her coming to my cave, the sanctuary, the sacred studio, and making the song from scratch. After we did that and those were the really awesome experiences, this song was one she had played me,\" he stated.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Ol.jpg[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI am plum tuckered out. \nThank you all for reading and I hope you enjoyed it!",

      "message": "[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1OI.jpg[/img][/align]\n\n\"How do you feel about the new policy involving Booters and Stressers?\"\n\n[i]\"I personally feel as if the new policy regarding the sales and advertisements \nof Stressers and Booters is a huge relief for a majority of the HackForums community. \nUnless you have ownership over a booter or stresser, you won't be affected by \nthese changes. I agree with Omniscient's decision, as not only will this have an \naffect on the amount of members wearing signatures relating to stresser and \nbooter products, but there will be less drama on HackForums, from my perspective.\nSome members beg to differ, though. They think that Omniscient did this because \nit would increase the sales of UB3R subscription; that's not true. Omniscient made \na huge risk, as members will no longer be able to purchase stickies relating to \nstresser and booter products. Of course, there are still the Sponsored Member \nsub-forums, in which groups can sell their products, so that's a huge advantage \nfor them. I have never really been too keen when it comes to purchasing and \nselling stresser-related products and content. I have maybe bought the odd \none or two stressers (..one being the Respawn stresser; I bought lifetime). I \nthought that once I bought a lifetime subscription on a stresser, I would never \nneed to pay for it again. There are a lot of useful and unique tools on the market, \nbut there's nothing unique when it comes to the selling of stressers and booters; \nthey're all generic products which members create in an attempt to generate \nsome quick cash. \"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1351440][i]-Dr. Uzi[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I believe Omni is doing the right thing. The Stresser ads were \ngetting out of hand, and you'd practically see them everywhere on peoples' \nsigs. Hopefully the new rules implemented will be respected and everything \ncalms down. Also, I read that only Ub3rs will be able to make threads in SST. \nThat, personally, seams a bit unfair, but I also see the logic behind that decision. \nThe idea behind L33ts who've been denied Ub3r joining up with Ub3r members to \nsell their product seems fine enough, but I can already imagine well respected \nUb3rs getting spammed by L33ts who'll be begging for their product sold. Another \nthing that would be nice would be opening a subforum about Stressers and \nBooters. Omni stated he'd think about it when the policy would take full effect. \nThat idea to me seems to be adequate in itself, and personally it should be \nimplemented. But hey, it's my opinion. As a conclusion, it seams fair enough, and \nI support Omni 100%. Sure, maybe more than a handfull of people will get\n affected by this, sellers and GFX artists in general, but it'll clean up the majority \nof HF, like how Omni put it, \"Moving it back into it's place. It doesn't belong in \n90% on the Forum. It belongs in only 2%\" \"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1376915][i]-๖ۣۜEmperor Palamecia[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"The changes in the booter section are going to bring serenity and organization \nthat hasn't been present in months, to the sections that people would get their \nbooter threads stickied in. I am not sure I see the necessity in signature rule, \nbut I love the isolation of the threads for selling the booters and stress testers. \nI find it awesome that Omni has declared the stipulation that booters blacklist \nhackforums.net from their patrons ability to DDoS. Hopefully, yet unlikely, that \nwill cause a decline in attacks on HF. Sadly skids will be skids so I am not sure \nabout that. Overall I see these new set of stipulations and rules to bring this forum \ntowards greater and everlasting success.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][i]-Kray[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Very, Very glad Omniscient decided to put this in effect. I have \nseen plenty of banned members use other people to sell their booter. People \nwould often make multiples of booters using different domains, but the same APIs. \nI feel like Omniscient will lose revenue, but it is a good decision. As Omni said \nhimself, stickies were always filled in the booter's section. Although, I don't agree \nwith \"No advertising stressers in signature\". I think that is a big place for advertising, \nbut it will even out now that most booters are taken down due to not being Ub3r. \nOverall, I think this will affect HackForums positively, Even if HackForums is known \nfor having tons of stressers.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1498588][i]-WaterSpice[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"How do you feel about the new 'Crypto Currency' forum?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://puu.sh/2G1Pn.jpg[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iUgc0PzuPlwS3.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1PQ.jpg[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/BDRLKfW.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Kris/lumber.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Qu.jpg[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121196]Natha[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/Y2HFq]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528]Odin the Wanderer[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody‍[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854]CarrotMilk[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193]Connected[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679]SkyGuy[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editor[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426]+Awesome[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody‍[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021]Retribute[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
