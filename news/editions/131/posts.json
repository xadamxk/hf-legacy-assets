You are a 09 member if I remember correctly, what ever brought you to the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah, I've been on HF a while. To be completely honest, I was into the hacking/owning scene of Habbohotel.ca, and searching for keyloggers on google, I stumbled onto HackForums, been a pretty active member since. I joined along side with a friend of mine, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=124317]HeadRush[/url].\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: A while is an understatment, your 4 year mark had just passed a month ago! Anyways, Why did you choose Baked as a username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah, I was going to do a nice feedback thread, but I was busy and never got around to it, I've seen HackForums change drastically for the better and worse. But as for my username, anyone who knows and has talked to me would know why, but I'll just leave it at, I like cake and cookies.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: We'll leave that for the users to decide!  You mentioned change, what was the biggest Hack Forums change you have witnessed since joining the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: To be brutally honest, the biggest changes I've witnessed is Omni. He used to be a more community involved admin, not saying he isn't anymore, but for members that have been here a while they will vouch for this. I don't blame him at all, HackForums is his business and if I was in the position he was, I'd be the same if not worse.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I have noticed this as well. I used to see his older posts on all types of threads, now I only see him post on threads regarding important matters. I can't blame the big man, he's got a lot to do! Being such an old member, do you have a specific section that you call home?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: I've really jumped around a lot, I used to lead RATs Crew and be very active in the RAT Section, I've sold some big products that made me active within the marketplace, I've even went through the stages of lounging and having fun with it. I don't think I could name a section that I would call home right now, but if I had to choose one it'd be Terror Sub-forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I have noticed your leadership in the group lately, you're doing an excellent job controlling things! You mentioned projects, do you have anything planned for the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah, I've been planning some great stuff for Terror, with our new formation which is in development right now, we hope to become a great contributer to the community and the marketplace with some unique group products/systems that will change the way certain products are sold within the marketplace. But for the projects I'm running solely, I've got a few things in development, Relentless Stresser, which we did a forced launch that didn't work out and we're revamping now, it will have some great flood methods and features to create a good experience for our customers. Other things which are a scanning system, with some twists, multi-account cracking program, and maybe a new software to create proxies.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: WOAH! You've got a lot planned for the community, much that I didn't know about. How did you ever get into a leadership position in the Rats Crew and in Terror?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: I just take initiative within the group, and confront the leaders with ideas and plans that could better the group. With RATs crew, I created the system of which second in command members are 'Right Hand Men', which I think a few groups use this title. I thought of ways the group could work together to better the community, so I climbed ranks and then Zach promoted me to leader. But then WiFi and him went out for lunch, after WiFi refused to do the assesment I put in place, he took it Zach saying I allowed him to do so, which got me removed as leader and WiFi added, few weeks later, RATs crew was disbanned. Terror on the other end was purely initiative to do better things with the group, and BV1 noticed that and we talked, then he chose me to lead.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: With so much time and detication on the forums, surely you have met some great people. Do you have any friends or members that you have made partnerships with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: For sure I have, most memorable partner I ever had was KillaMuvz with Cryptex. Thing went downhill for us due to a lot of problems, and bad decisions. To this day I still owe him some money and my word that I'll be paying him back as soon as I get ahold of him, I've searched FaceBook, and other websites with no luck. For friends, most memorable are Thoth, Mike., BumperJumper and all the members in the RATs crew that I lead.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for sharing your story with everyone Baked. To end this off, do you have anything you would like to finish this off with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=37251][color=white][b]Baked[/b][/color][/url]: No problem Adam, and thanks for the interview. I'd just like to tell people to watch out for my new products, and my shout-outs to The Relentless Crew, LiteSpeed and Terror, and to everyone else I talk to, to many to list!

Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url]  I would like to give a special shoutout to Paradoxum and Tibit, being the leaders of the two great groups I'm in.

It seems for a lot of people that what they love about Hack Forums is the usergroups they are in. What would you say is the best part of the groups you are a part of?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] Without a doubt the subcommunity, you feel like you have a place to get away from the chaos of the public areas and have the opportunity to relax. If you are in one group for several months, you really get to know the other members within. I've made many new friends in both The Alliance and The Empire, and the experience only improves with each day that passes. Even though the people in both of the groups I'm in are entirely different, I would not be able to choose one over the other.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome. I definitely know what you mean. What was it that originally brought you to HF? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] Back in the fall of 2011, I became interested in Minecraft server administration. I quickly found out that people could be using so called \"hacked\" clients, and set out to try these myself in order to get a better understanding of detecting them on my servers. In order to download a very popular one at the time, Nodus, I was required to register. I quickly found out that the HF community stretches far beyond the griefing section, and decided to partake, teaching others what I know while learning what I do not.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Ahh. HF does have a pretty big Minecraft community! Congratulations on your mad scientist award for [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3223691]this thread[/url]. Building your own 3D printer is definitely not an everyday activity! What was it that made you want to do it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you very much. Aside from programming, I've been interested in 3D modelling for quite a while. My first intention was to create a large assortment of models (creatures, trees, even blades of grass) which I could then later on use in any games I develop. I then found a YouTube video on 3D printing, a service that would print out your World of Warcraft character, and was amazed by the possibilities. Being able to create something on a computer and then being able to hold a real physical object in your hand an hour later is something most of us can only dream of. Only after that initial jolt of interest did I realize how useful it can actually be to have a 3D printer. From coat hooks to phone cases, I no longer have the need to buy many things, as I can just make it myself. I predict that within 10 years, household 3D printing will become a new norm, and I'm excited about being one of the first to have a crack at this upcoming technology.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, there definitely are endless possibilities with 3D printing! How long did your current printer take to \"complete\"? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] Believe it or not, I still don't consider it to be complete. There are many things I still need to improve and add on to it. However, I was able to get prints I was content with close to the end of November, about four months after beginning the assembly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] That's understandable, especially with such a complicated contraption! It's evident that anyone wanting to create their own 3D printer will have to dedicate a lot of time and a bit of cash, too, but if someone wanted to, where would you recommend they start? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any guides or tutorials on how to start building one?\nThe best thing to do before ever beginning to build a 3D printer is to do a lot of research. Look into Arduinos, firmwares, host software, and your intended print area. I've found RepRap.org to be a marvellous place to ask questions or to browse around looking for solutions to common problems.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for your advice! You also mentioned you were into programming? What was it that sparked your interest there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] Back in middle school, I took basic geometry. The calculators that were recommended were TI-84Plus calculators. I quickly figured out that I could use the language TIBasic to make small programs that would give me the answers to questions in that class. Things such as the Pythagorean Theorem and other basic formulas took me seconds instead of minutes to figure out, and I ended that class with a grade above a 100. From there, I quickly advanced to more useful languages and eventually decided to do my best to make a career out of software development.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] That's definitely a cool way to start :) I appreciate you taking the time out of your day for this; thank you for joining us and giving us such a wonderful interview! Any last words before we conclude? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656][color=white][b]Mohatu:[/b][/color][/url] I appreciate the work you and the other News Team members do for the community. I want to finish off the interview by saying that I am very approachable, and anyone who needs help with anything should feel free to send me a message. Thanks again for taking the time to interview me, and I wish the enirety of HackForums a good week.\n[/spoiler]",

Mojang has teamed up with a few other indie developers to bring us a new humble bundle, a pack of games given to players who donate a penny or more to certain charities. They have dubbed this pack the 'Mojam' humble bundle, and all games within the bundle were inspired by certain words picked by the Minecraft community. In addition to this, the games were all made in a [i]very[/i] short amount of time; in fact, they were all made within a time frame of 72 hours. Among the bizarre list of titles within the bundle are \"Nuclear Pizza War\", \"Battle Frogs\" and \"Space Hunk\". If you'd like to donate to a good cause and get a few fun games in the process, head over to the [url=http://www.humblebundle.com/]Mojam Humble Bundle webpage.[/url]\n\n[color=#87CEEB][b]Planet Beacon News[/b][/color][list]\n[*] Protection IV armor was added to the online store.\n[*] hihihih565, along with a few other members, opened a new casino where you can make IGM bets and double your money.

It was revealed at the Playstation Meeting in New York on February 20. The system will have 8GB of system memory and a powerful GPU. Sony also revealed the Dualshock 4 controller - it has a screen, a mic, share button and a headphone jack. It also has a Move sensor. The event revealed the new console, however we still don't know what the console will look like! Hopefully we'll see it sometime in the near future. Along with the new console, a line-up of PS4 games have been announced and include Knack, inFamous: Second Son, Killzone: Shadow Fall, Diablo III, Destiny, Watch Dogs, New Final Fantasy (to be unveiled at E3 2013), Drive Club, Deep Down (working title) and The Witness. The PS4 won't require an always-on internet connection, which was spouted up by many rumours. The new console should release in late 2013.\n\n[color=white][b]Possible Xbox Event[/b][/color]\nA NeoGAF member may have uncovered a possible upcoming Xbox event. It suggests that Microsoft could be preparing to announce their next-generation console. WHOIS data shows that the domain \"XboxEvent.com\" was registered by U.S. Techs, who recently rebranded as Eventcore. He also stated that the company U.S. Techs registered \"XboxE312.com\", which was used for people to sign up for Microsoft’s press briefing at E3 last year. On top of that, U.S Techs also host the 2013 Microsoft Hosting Summit website. Dates for the event haven't been announced, however rumours say the announcement could be in April. Gaming news websites have tried to contact Microsoft regarding the new domain. \"Microsoft often acquires various domain names as part of its ongoing business strategy, but beyond that we have no comment.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox LIVE Ultimate Game Sale[/b][/color]\nMajor Nelson announced that the Xbox LIVE Ultimate Game Sale will start on February 26. Sixty-one games from the games-on-demand service are set to be discounted throughout the sale period. Titles will be on sale for up to 75% off, with a handful on discount for 85% off.

IGN tells you everything you need to know about the PS4 - there is a lot, so a video would be the best way to go.\n\n[align=center][spoiler]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq6_wTQqygk[/video]\n[/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/27vj8[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]The Vatican: Sex, Drugs, Gay Priests [/b][/color]\nLately, rumors of the Vatican linked to sex, drugs, and gay priests have become relevant. Many people have speculated that this is why Pope Benedict XVI has resigned. Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone denied all of the rumors, and he stated that there has been a recent appearance of \"often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories...[that] cause serious damage to persons and institutions.\" The country's largest newspaper, La Repubblica, said that an investigation revealed the church was connected to sex, drugs, and homosexuality from low to high level persons working within the Vatican.\n\n[color=white][b]Span Continues to Boil[/b][/color]\nProtesters numbering in the tens of thousands rallied in cities across the country this Saturday. The protests come over complaints of too much austerity, corruption in the political system, and moves towards free markets. Alberto, an account administrator for a German multinational in Madrid, stated, \"I'm here to add my voice. They're cutting where they shouldn't cut; health, education ... basic services. And the latest corruption scandal is just the tiniest tip of a very large iceberg.\" With Spain being in a economic downturn for the last half of the decade, protests have become a common thing for citizens. One of the main complaints is the deep spending cuts in the health industry.\n\n[color=white][b]North Korea Gives Warning to the United States Forces[/b][/color]\nThe North Korean government said to the United States that destruction would ensue if \"your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises ... at this dangerous time.\" In recent events, North Korea has detonated a nuclear charge, and they publicly showed their cruise missiles were capable of remarkable accuracy. However, the United Nations Military Commission announced to North Korea that the United States and South Korea will be engaging in military exercises.\n\n[color=white][b]16 Dead and 117 Wounded[/b][/color]\nIn New Delhi, India, twin bomb blasts have left 16 dead and 117 people wounded. Officials say that it is possible that this is a terrorist attack, and Sushil Kumar Shinde publicly stated that they are working hard to make arrests. The twin bombs were strapped onto bicycles in a busy marketplace. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has condemned the attack, and he has appropriated funds for the next of kin of those harmed or killed. It was also reported that the bombs were likely detonated by means of a timer. However, that remains as just speculation due to the fact that the bombs were improvised explosives.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/27vjA[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Microsft[/b][/color]\nLast week, Microsoft found that an undetermined amount of their computers were infected with malware. The company confirmed the infection of their PCs but claims that there was no sign of compromised user data. Matt Thomlinson, wrote on a blog post that \"Consistent with our security response practices, we chose not to make a statement during the initial information gathering process. During our investigation, we found a small number of computers, including some in our Mac business unit, that were infected by malicious software using techniques similar to those documented by other organizations. We have no evidence of customer data being affected and our investigation is ongoing. This type of cyberattack is no surprise to Microsoft and other companies that must grapple with determined and persistent adversaries (see our prior analysis of emerging threat trends). We continually re-evaluate our security posture and deploy additional people, processes, and technologies as necessary to help prevent future unauthorized access to our networks.\"\n\n[color=white][b]LG[/b][/color]\nLG has no plans on marketing Windows 8 mobiles. According to LG, it is that Microsoft's mobile operating system is of no such huge demand these days. An LG representative said, \"We want to give customers what they ask for.\" LG was one of the early partners that signed on with Microsoft, releasing the LG Quantum in the first wave of Windows Phone devices. Windows Phone has been slow to catch on with consumers or it finds difficult to catch up with iPhone or Android handsets. For the past few years, LG has been marketing Windows phones but now, they have decided to change to meet the consumer's needs. \"When there's a significant market for it, we will be on board,\" said LG.\n\n[color=white][b]Sony[/b][/color]\nSony announced its newer gaming console, PS4, last week at a press event held at New York. However, Sony didn't show the PS4. So, it is unknown how the device looks like. Sony says that the next generation video game console features a PC like body with x86 CPU, enhanced PS GPU, 8GB of unified memory, a local storage hard drive, and an updated DualShock 4 controller. Sony demonstrated to the people who attended the press about how it will be using the console but did not show the console itself. You may watch the video below.\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0vcqayut0E&feature=player_embedded[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/27vmS[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Mindy McCready Funeral News[/b][/color]\nThe country singer Mindy McCready will be burried by her family next Tuesday. The 37-year old was found dead from a single gunshot wound to the head on the porch of her Heber Springs, Arkansas home. USA Today reports a private funeral is scheduled for next Tuesday in her hometown of Fort Myers, Florida. The accommodation will be held at Crossroads Church. A memorial accommodation is scheduled for March 6 in Nashville, Tennessee. There will be an event at which various musicians will attend in her memory during the ceremony at the Cathedral of The Incarnation. A key piece of evidence pointing towards suicide is the fact that the body of her fiancé, David Wilson, was discovered in the same spot of their Arkansas home on January 13; his passing is still being investigated by police but they are close to confirming that the cause of his death was also suicide. Shortly after David's death, Mindy was admitted to a course in which they were going to decide whether she was mentally sound or abusing alcohol. She was relinquished two days later. Mindy's personal tragedies have been well documented through the years. She has struggled with mental health and alcohol abuse and has endeavored to commit suicide an abundance of times in the past. She was also notoriously hospitalized for slitting her wrists in 2008. \n\n[color=white][b]Nick Carter Proposes to Girlfriend[/b][/color]\nThe Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter is now officially engaged to actress Lauren Kitt. Whilst seemingly confident, he did afterwards admit that the process of proposing was a little nerve-wracking. 'I had the ring in my pocket for two weeks,' he told People.com. 'I was like, 'I don't want it anymore!' It was driving me insane. I just wanted to get it out of my hands and on to hers.' For the special occasion he had decided to take Lauren to the Florida Keys on a boat ride. However, the romance wasn't quite what he had hoped for after he discovered his old boat needed some major maintenance. \"My boat was in such bad condition because I hadn't used it for, like, six years. It took me five days literally on my hands and knees, scraping up my body to fix it.\" By the end, the couple had decided to go on the cruise before finishing the maintenance, putting them at a minor risk. Despite stalling on the way, they reached their destination - an island Nick adored when he was a child. Lauren has now been dating the Backstreet Boy for four years, and she commented that being presented with a seven-carat diamond ring was an incredible surprise. \"I wasn't expecting it. It just felt very surreal,' she said.\n\n[color=white][b]Katie Melua's Performance for British Army[/b][/color]\nSinger Katie Melua has recently returned from her \"special gig\", in which she performed to part of the British Army who were fighting in Afghanistan at the time. The artist performed a variety of her tracks during her visit to Forward Operating Base 'Shawqat' in Helmand Province's Nad-e Ali district which is the home to soldiers from 1st Battalion The Mercian Regiment. The concert, held in an engineering tent at the camp's vehicle park, was organized by The British Forces Foundation (BFF) charity. After the event, she said: \"It felt like such a special gig - all the soldiers were there and it felt really incredible. I was frankly captivated by the scene, just being out here in the desert, pitch black, just me and my guitar. I hope they liked it as much as I enjoyed being on stage.\" The day before the performance, Katie enjoyed the day touring the Forward Operating Base and speaking to a number of troops on duty at FOB Shawqat. Katie also agreed to play a song on special request after a meeting with the soldiers called \"Just like Heaven\". The event was the second time in which she has worked with the British Forces Foundation and she has said that she hopes to work with them many more times in the future.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwHtaCTEitE[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/27vny[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nAlright guys, this week, we have a special treat. The founder of the HF News has asked that his message be put in our latest edition, so I hope you'll all join me for a read!\n\n[quote=Yin]\nHey there.\n\nFor those of you who don't know me, I'm Yin.. creator of the very news your eyes are feasting on at this very moment. Dating back to 2009/2010, I was a member of the staff team and additionally kicked off projects like HF News and the Reviewers with Skill. We are now (at the time of this letter) in February of 2013.\n\nI'd like to take some time to reflect on this project that simply started as a hobby and evolved into something much bigger. HF News is now 130 or so (weekly) editions deep. That is huge. For two and a half years, the forum has been provided with the news and what has been going on. I really do believe that the best part of HF News is the fact that you can go back and look at the very first edition or any of the 130 and you can see what happened that week. That is truly remarkable.\n\nhttp://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=423656\n\nTake a look at the very first edition. I was alone and very bored on a Saturday night when everyone was away. While I was browsing the forums, I wondered why we didn't have a simple news segment/article that could go out weekly detailing what had occured in that single week. \n\nHF News took off. I posted the first thread in The Lounge, and shortly after Omni (without me asking, although a lot of people wanted it) made it a subforum. That was a very good feeling. \n\nEventually, I didn't do the news anymore and it was passed down before it landed into Sir's hands. I'd just like to thank everyone who has ever put time into this project and made it as spectacular as it is today. This is something that truly makes me happy to know that I started. Forget being a staff member or anything else I ever did, this truly is the greatest accomplishment. \n\nPlease acknowledge (if you haven't already) the amount of time it takes to do this sort of thing. This is a VOLUNTEER position and always has been. I never got paid a single cent, and that's the way it should be. This isn't something that takes 15 minutes, even the editions that I did (way shorter than they are now) took me at least 2 hours. \n\nSo comment. If you're reading this and usually don't post a reply, do it. Thank the team that is making this possible. It's a big deal and means a lot to me. Thank you to the Writers team and the people who take time out of their busy to day to read these.\n\nHave a good one.\n\n-Yin\n[/quote]",

HackForums now breeds these members, and there are new ones joining every day. \nOver the next five years, I strongly anticipate that HackForums will continue to grow, \nreaching new levels of recognition by both the media, for there are numerous members who \nhave grown and promote HF through their 'activities', as well as in terms of metrics.
