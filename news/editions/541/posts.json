The Switch 2 has maintained its momentum as Nintendo’s fastest selling hardware ever, clearing 3.5 million units in four days.\n\nThe price of the base Switch 2 along with the newest \"Mario Kart World\" bundle costs $499. The most expensive Nintendo console to date compared to the 2017 release of the OG Switch at $299.\n\nRecent news about the Switch 2 have been mostly positive throughout consumers. Gamers praise the 7.9″ 1080p HDR LCD, 4K docked/120 Hz handheld output, dual USB-C ports, and the new GameChat and Mouse Mode features. Gamers critique focus on limited 256 GB storage, reliance on expensive MicroSD, battery life lasting 2 hours for more resource intensive games and 4 on lighter games, and a fragile kickstand.\n\n[color=#FF5F54][b]AMD launches Radeon RX 9060 XT[/b][/color]\n[spoiler][img]https://media.wired.com/photos/68543d7a5dac0d52fed4353d/master/w_1920,c_limit/Radeon%20RX%209060%20XT.png[/img][/spoiler]\nThis card offers high-end 1080p and reliable 1440p performance, a long-term card with enough VRAM for future games, and a big bang for your buck compared to Nvidia’s overpriced mid-range lineup.\n\n[color=#72FF84]Buying Tips:[/color]\n[list]\n[*]Compare models: Variants like XFX, Gigabyte, Sapphire, and Asus differ in cooling, factory overclocks, and aesthetics.\n[*]Check stock often: These cards sell quickly at MSRP; price trackers or browser extensions can help catch restocks.\n[*]Beware of scalpers: Avoid third-party listings with inflated prices, especially on Amazon.\n[*]Factor in taxes/shipping: Newegg and Best Buy may offer free shipping; Amazon may charge extra.\n[/list]\n\nBenchmark:[spoiler][img]https://media.wired.com/photos/68543bfd00ad53ee077ad2e4/master/w_1600,c_limit/3DMark%20Benchmarks.png[/img][/spoiler][spoiler][img]https://media.wired.com/photos/68543c0f65a16734c0ccda88/master/w_1600,c_limit/Common%20Games%20-%201080p.png[/img][/spoiler][spoiler][img]https://media.wired.com/photos/68543c18aa045b9ac126dde2/master/w_1600,c_limit/Common%20Games%20-%201440p.png[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[color=#72FF84]Notable News (June 2025)[/color]\n[color=#FF5F54][b]Nintendo Switch 2 $1.4M HEIST[/b][/color]\n\"A semi-truck driver reported that he had just discovered his trailer had been broken into during a pre-trip inspection, and several pallets of the newly released Nintendo Switch 2 game consoles were stolen - 2,810 of them to be exact\"\n\nA truck driver in route to a Grapevine, Texas Gamestop from Nintendo's HQ in Redmond, Washington was doing a pre-trip inspection at a Love's Truck Stop in Bennett, Colorado. The driver notified Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office immediately upon realizing his truck had been broken into. Many people throughout the internet believe this to be an inside job. The driver claims \"I did not know what was in the trailer, only that it was games or toys\". Seems fishy to me, but we will let the investigators do their job and work towards finding the culprits. How can you steal almost 3,000 hand held consoles without anyone realizing what was happening in or around the truck stop? If the suspects are found, they could face charges of felony theft valued at $1 million or more and criminal mischief.\n\n[color=#FF5F54][b]Roblox dethrones Fortnite[/b][/color]\nOn June 14, 2025, Roblox’s latest farming simulator “Grow a Garden” set a new historical record with 16.4 million concurrent users logged in simultaneously. “Grow a Garden” combines relaxing farming mechanics with social multiplayer features, attracting a diverse base of gamers eager for interaction in the Roblox world.\nIn 2020, Fortnite hosted a live virtual concert featuring artist Travis Scott.
