You may be very curious to explore interests or hobbies that channel the passionate and competitive side of your nature.\r\n\r\nPlus, with a delightful sun-Venus connection on Tuesday, this is a perfect chance to break the ice and ask that special person on a date. It could be a heartwarming experience. In general, this is not the time to hide away but to get out and enjoy the experience of living and loving.\r\n\r\nFriday may need a little bit of care as an impulsive Mercury-Uranus tie could see you purchasing something on the spur of the moment. Later, though, you could regret it and feel you’ve wasted your money. A pause for thought would be helpful.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, feisty Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of lifestyle and wellness, inspiring you to get organized and jettison activities that you’ve lost interest in.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Once again, your home and family sector is the main focus, with plenty of action in this area. This could be the week you’re planning to hold a major celebration, reunion, or other get-together, in which case it could all go very well.\r\n\r\nTuesday could be particularly lovely for having family and friends around or perhaps doing something to beautify your place. This can be a lovely time for wandering around vintage shops or interior design offices and picking up some ideas and interesting pieces as well.\r\n\r\nThere may be a clash of opinions on Friday that could be difficult to resolve if both of you are being particularly stubborn. One of you will need to give way and find a compromise in order to move on.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, there’s a change of focus as warrior Mars moves into Virgo and your leisure sector. Whether you enjoy sports or you’re looking to date, you could be quite competitive.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Do you have something to say? It’s seems no one will be able to get a word in edgewise. With a powerful focus on your sector of communication, your conversation and desire to interact could ramp up several notches. If you work in sales, media, or tech, you could have a busy and productive week ahead of you. And with the sun merging with luscious Venus, it might be possible to sign a lucrative deal or bond with someone who can be of great benefit to you in the future.\r\n\r\nMercury angles toward restless Uranus on Friday, which could make it difficult to communicate. You may talk at cross purposes and end up completely misunderstanding each other. Not the best outcome if you’re going on a first date.\r\n\r\nAs fiery Mars moves into Virgo and your home zone over the weekend, this active influence could see you making short of work of tasks that have been on your domestic to-do list for a long time.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=3]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3399ff]Cancer ♋[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"You might be on a mission to get your finances sorted out, but at the same time you might also have shopping on your mind. You may need to find a balance between the two if you’re going to keep money matters on an even keel.\r\n\r\nHowever, the focus on your sector of values could also be a call to consider your level of self-worth. Learning to love yourself could be one factor that helps increase your income.\r\n\r\nThe way you want to spend your Friday evening may be different than that of your friends. Go your own way and do your own thing, because you really can have more fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, as dynamic Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of communication on Saturday, you may be more proactive about promoting your work, getting organized, and networking with all the right people. It would help to avoid being too critical, though, of both yourself and others.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With some empowering influences in your sign this week, you may feel as though you can accomplish anything. Your confidence looks high, and you’ll find it easy to express yourself, get help and support for your various plans and projects, and be the leader you naturally are.\r\n\r\nThis week can be excellent for a makeover, and a lovely transit involving sweet Venus might inspire you to reinvent yourself. This can be very self-affirming if you’ve recently been through a period of change and wish to embrace this more fully.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to connecting with your boss or someone in authority on Friday, there’s a chance you may not see eye to eye. While this won’t last too long, it’s best not to hold any important conversations at this time because they may not turn out the way you want.\r\n\r\nYour psyche may be more stirred up than usual from this weekend and for around six weeks. Watch your dreams because they may provide creative inspiration.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=5]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#339933]Virgo ♍[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"A powerful focus on your spiritual sector could encourage you to focus on spiritual practices, such as meditation, yoga, or anything else that can help bring peace of mind.\r\n\r\nLooking for romance? Tuesday may bring possibilities if you’re going to a tai chi class or other group. Connecting with those who share your ideas and ideals could assist you in meeting someone very special.\r\n\r\nThis is very much a time to think about hiring the services of a life coach who can help you live to your full potential.\r\n\r\nHowever, your beliefs and those of another could clash on Friday. While it might drive you apart, it can also draw you together. You might really appreciate someone who thinks very differently than you.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, dynamic Mars moves into your sign for a six-week stay, enhancing your energy and courage. The coming weeks could be very productive for you.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Your social life sparkles with promise, and it looks like this side of life will be particularly busy over this week and the coming weeks. Whether you’re a member of various groups, meeting with friends, or just getting out and about, you certainly won’t be bored.\r\n\r\nLooking for romance? This is one of the peak times of the year for enjoying life and setting in motion the process of connecting with others. You have more chances now to meet that special person, and encounters can be lively and stimulating. You’re very likely to stand out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut as feisty Mars moves into Virgo and a subtler sector of your chart, this is the time to do a little emotional housecleaning. Are you looking for closure on key issues? Use this opportunity to break free.\r\n\r\nYou may also feel moved to learn a spiritual practice, such as meditation or tai chi, so you can learn how to get out of your own way and flow with life.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With a lively house party going on in Leo and your sector of goals and ambitions, this is no time to stay behind the scenes. The cosmos is encouraging you to promote your work in a big way and not hold back from letting others know what you can do. You’ll have a magnetic attraction about you that others may not be able to resist. If you’re eager to make a big splash, this is very much the time to do so.\r\n\r\nPlus, with the sun and lively Venus linking up on Tuesday, you can harness the benefit of this transit by doing a presentation or appearing in public. Don’t be surprised if good things come from this.\r\n\r\nTravel and adventure may beckon from Saturday when warrior Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of far horizons. This could see you reaching out for opportunities that are a bit of a stretch.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Considering the very positive influences in your travel zone, the coming weeks could see you eager to explore. This is a time to relax on an exotic vacation that can melt away your worries and leave you feeling more at peace.\r\n\r\nIf you have an urge to learn something new or get a certification, this is the time to go for it. In fact, anything that can stretch your abilities and shift you out of your comfort zone has to be very good for you. The willingness to take a leap of faith could see you enjoying a steep learning curve.\r\n\r\nLater in the week, dynamic Mars moves into Virgo and your sector of goals, career, and ambitions. The coming six weeks are an opportunity to be more proactive regarding your plans. If you’ve faced obstacles, you’ll be ready to blast them out of the way. And if you’re willing to plan ahead, much can be accomplished.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=9]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#663333]Capricorn ♑[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"The focus is fairly deep at the moment, so don’t be surprised if you feel emotional at times. The current star map could stir up deep-seated feelings around finances, business, and committed relationships.\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity to face up to some of those feelings and issues that may have been a problem for too long. However, it can be easier to do so if you have a counselor, therapist, or trusted friend to talk to. Sharing your feelings can melt away those blocks over time and lead to a healthier and wealthier you.\r\n\r\nRomantic partnerships could sizzle at this time because there are some very fiery energies kindling the flame of passion and encouraging you to spend more time together.\r\n\r\nFrom the weekend, thoughts of travel, exploring far horizons, and embracing the bigger picture could tempt you to be more adventurous. If you haven’t booked a vacation in a while, you may relish the chance to kick back and unwind.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=10]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#9966ff]Aquarius ♒[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"A delightful merging of luscious Venus and the sun in your relationship zone on Tuesday indicates the potential for a wonderful get-together, special date, or just hanging out with friends and having a great time.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing focus on your sector of relationships looks like it’s keeping you busy, and you may find that your calendar is full most of the time. It helps to be selective when choosing which events to attend because some may show more promise than others. Still, these lively influences can see you connecting with all kinds of people who may become part of a vibrant network.\r\n\r\nDon’t jump to conclusions on Friday, though, as an edgy angle between chatty Mercury and electric Uranus could see arguments brewing if you don’t take the time to listen.\r\n\r\nFinally, potent Mars moves into Virgo and a more intense sector of your chart on Saturday, which could stir up your psyche.
