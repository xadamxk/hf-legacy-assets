While Mr. Trump mentioned the positives of the tough trade policies to the American people, he failed to mention any of the negatives. Beijing commented on this and stated that one of the things that they would expect in order to end the trade war between the two countries is lowered tariffs.  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/business/trump-trade-economy.html]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stall[/color][/b]\r\nThe S&P and dow jones indexes stalled on Friday after President Donald J.  Trump wavered over wether the tariffs in the ongoing trade war with China will be rolled back. The president had told reporters that the U.S government had not yet agreed to lift the tariffs. This contrasted what a spokesman for the Chinese military had said earlier that week. The Chinese Official had said that the two governments had indeed agreed to lift the tariffs. The NASDAQ however gained value on the back of the increase in share price of Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc. Nonetheless, the S&P 500 was on track for its fifth straight week of growth and the Nasdaq was on tack for a sixth week of growth.

The Trump administration in liaison with the Chinese government has been in discussion to come up with a palatable agreement that will benefit both nations. The trade wars have seen tariffs being raised for goods in both countries. The share index for top registered big 500 fortune companies increased by 0.9 percent. Among the best performers are the health-care stocks, Boeing and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/stocks-climb-to-record-highs-on-growing-trade-optimism/2019/11/15/bfcc81de-06f8-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]",

Its presence here energizes the area and encourages you to be proactive about any ongoing issues.\n\nThis week brings a further shift as quicksilver Mercury turns direct in the same zone on Wednesday. You could see a gradual improvement in financial and business matters, especially if they’ve been subject to delays.\n\nThere is another change as the sun enters Sagittarius for a four-week stay on Friday, encouraging you to look to far horizons and traverse new terrain. If you’ve had doubts about your abilities or self-worth, the weekend could find you feeling more buoyant.\n\nHowever, you could also feel restless, and this could reach a peak on Sunday.

Do you need to clear the air? You’ll be very tempted, but try not to come on too strong if you want to keep the relationship intact. If you don’t mind one way or the other, then tell it like it is.\n\nIf you’ve been on the receiving end of mixed messages or misunderstandings, things can begin to change as talkative Mercury turns direct midweek. You’ll have an opportunity to finalize any deals or agreements you’ve been working on, too. Give yourself a week or so, though, so that Mercury can get back on track.\n\nAre you ready to get rid of those skeletons in the closet? The sun’s move into Sagittarius and a more intense zone on Friday could see you ready to do some emotional housecleaning.\n\nThis weekend, you might be in an independent mood and eager to do your own thing.

Try to pace yourself, Gemini, particularly as the week gathers pace. As Mars moves to oppose electric Uranus over the weekend, a restless streak could see you taking shortcuts that might backfire.\n\nThe good news this week is that Mercury, your personal planet, turns direct midweek after its retrograde phase, which could make life easier. As it gets back on track, there should be fewer delays and less likelihood of misunderstandings.\n\nThe sun glides into your relationship zone on Friday, and you could benefit from some insights into your closest bonds.

If so, with flirtatious Mercury in your romance sector pushing ahead midweek, things can begin to improve. Allow this to occur naturally, though.\n\nThe presence of the radiant sun in your lifestyle zone on Friday can give you a boost, and it may bring insights into what is working and what isn’t. This can be a chance to streamline your affairs and get back on track with your wellness routine.\n\nGo easy over the weekend, though, because a clash of perspectives could cause a rift.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[/color][/b]\n[i]\"With fiery Mars moving into your domestic sector this week, you’ll be ready to get your place in order.

The upshot can be more space and a freeing up of emotional energy that brings more happiness and money your way.\n\nIf life has been a tad trying over recent weeks, it could be due to quicksilver Mercury’s retrograde phase. This planet turns direct on Wednesday, which means a gradual end to any frustrations and delays.\n\nReady for some fun? As the fiery sun moves into your leisure zone, you might be more inclined to get out and about. Romantic and creative opportunities await you, but most of all, you might feel like doing something adventurous.\n\nThe weekend could bring unexpected demands or responsibilities your way.

Deals that were held up may now begin to show signs of movement.\n\nYou’ll also benefit from the movement of the sun into your home zone, where it will stay for four weeks.

You may find that things begin to pick up and progress in this area becomes possible.\n\nIf you’re ready to tell it like it is, you could be more outspoken than usual once the sun moves into Sagittarius on Friday.
