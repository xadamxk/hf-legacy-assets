The group features a striking new userbar that appropriately reflects the chilling name of the virgin crew. All paid and non-paid members were kicked from the group for the transition, but no need to fret. The group will readmit any of those who were kicked come Monday by PMing a leader. I have a feeling the leaders will be flooded with Monday-messages, compliments of that sexy new userbar.  \n\n[b][color=white]Omniscient Expands Servers[/color][/b]\nSite owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has announced the expansion of servers for the site. The announcement comes after a string of several attacks that have caused disruption of the site for various periods of time. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] says he will purchase three new servers for the site that should help minimize the site downtime. The culprit of the recent attacks seem to be the publication of several IP addresses. The new servers will bring the total of IP addresses up to 24.

Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make before we continue?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be in HF News.\nI also would like to shoutout to Zixem one of the most knowledgeable members in HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How did you meet him? Through Eminence or just general discussion?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: Me and Zixem knowing each other for a year already and we met before i joined HF.\nWe had some tough moments once in a while, but we always worked it out like true friends.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad to hear you have such a close friendship. How did you get involved in Eminence?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: At the beginning of the story i wanted to purchase the whole group and change it to a whole new level.\nBut then i realized i can't afford that.\nSo I thought, instead of buying the whole group, I can just buy a leadership spot and change it.\nThat's how I become a leader of Eminence.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: So people can buy leadership into the group, now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: No, WiFi is no longer selling leadership spots.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How much money did you pay for leadership, though?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: Me and WiFi. worked a deal. I'm sorry I can't tell much about it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: That's all right. What do you plan to change in Eminence?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: As for start ...\nI'm looking for HQ Members to increase the value of this group.\nIt's kinda hard to do it while WiFi is selling the group but I promise I will do my best to keep it alive & HQ.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: If you had had your way, what would Eminence have become?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: I was thinking about changing the userbar & name of the group. I will definitely make it an invitation only group and never selling spots. I was thinking about making a new coding group that will stick together & work on projects together with people who will share their knowledge with other members of the group & the whole community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Aiming high, I see. Eminence is a web mastery group; why not cultivate some web languages within the group and get some good stuff going on there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: I wish I could do that, but as long as WiFi trying to sell the group, there's  nothing much to do about it.\nHopefully one day I will be able to do that and change it to the way it was before or even to a better group than it used to be.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: I missed how Eminence used to be. :c Why do you think WiFi is such a rush to sell the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: Trust me i miss the old Eminence too.\nI'm not sure about the reason he's selling the group, but it's his choice and I respect that.\nHopefully, someday, someone with enough resources & knowledge can take control over the group.\nWiFi has a lot going on lately and I understand him for being so rushed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Understandable... any closing comments to wrap things up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=white][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, I would like to let everyone know that we (the leaders of Eminence) are always keeping an open mind & if you have any suggestions about the group feel free to PM me.\nI would also like to thank +Entity for giving me the opportunity to clean things up & for this amazing interview.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=#00BFFF][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98]Bay[/color][/url][/font][/size][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Welcome to the latest edition of the HF News, Bay! Any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: Shoutout to my Hackercraft Faction: TheCompany, Genuine, Advanced, Conception, Phytrix, and any other people I forgot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Why, thank you for the shoutout! Who was your first friend on HF, or the first person to help you on HF, and how? What is your relationship with this/these member(s) currently?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: Genuine was my first friend on HF. I've honestly known him since I was a member. He knew me before I was leet, and before I was uber. We've been good online friends for a long time. I know I can trust him with anything. Currently, we own a Hackercraft faction, and we play on Minecraft almost every day.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: On that note, how do you feel Hackercraft is going?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: I feel Hackercraft is going really well. My only complaint is that we should have a better arena, and probably more members on here. Besides that, I love playing on it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I agree. Are you big on any other games currently? Which ones and why, if any?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: Nah, not really. I used to be a big Xbox gamer, but since sports are taking up most of my time, I didn't even bother to get Black Ops 2 or Halo 4. I do plan on selling my Xbox, and just sticking with PC Gaming. Who knows, maybe I'll get into Steam or DayZ.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: With Christmas rapidly approaching, what have you done to prepare for the holiday season and what do you plan to do over Christmas and New Years? Do you have any NY's resolutions?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: Well, this year my family isn't doing too much. My cousin is coming over and I plan on going out to downtown Chicago to walk around and see the sights with him. Over Christmas break, I'll probably spend more time on HF and Hackercraft. My only NY's resolution is to work harder to achieve what I want.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: And are you very experienced in the field of marketing? I see you have an open RDP store. Could you tell us more about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah, I'm decently experienced in the field of marketing. I've tried selling a lot of products throughout my HF career. I also plan on opening another Twitter Follower shop soon. I'm just doing things to get some extra money in my pocket for clothes, or to help my mom pay the bills.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Well, good luck with those endeavors. What sections do you enjoy the most on HF and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: I really enjoy the Marketplace the most. One can learn a lot about advertising and what people are attracted to buying.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: If you could choose one member to be MOTM, who would you choose and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: Honestly, I wouldn't know. I really don't think that any individual member of HF works any harder than other members. I'm sure there are plenty of people that deserve the award, just not noticed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for the interview today Bay. Any final comments before I let you go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812][color=#98FB98][b]Bay[/b][/color][/url]: I'd like to give everyone a word of advice. If you are having a hard time making money, don't think big and try to start something you can't handle. Just start small with something that's easy and brings a little bit of money in your pocket. Then, save up, and expand your business or transform it into something more efficient. If you need any advice or emotional help, I'd be glad to help you. Just shoot me a PM. Thanks, Phytrix and anyone else who took part in this, or read this.\n[/spoiler]",

His arrest came in September for being accused of posting links of the \"Innocence of Muslims\" viral movie. Alex is an atheist who comes from a Christian family. For Alex to appeal the court's decision, he must post bail at $167. The convicted man denies any claims that he linked that controversial anti-Islamic film. However, authorities still press charges on him for making other critiques about Islam. This arrest and conviction raises further concern for secularists and liberals about the drafting of the Egyptian constitution. In article 44 of the drafted constitution, it specifically outlaws speaking prophets. \n\n[color=white][b]Carnage in Connecticut[/b][/color]\n20 children no older than seven were gun downed in their elementary school by the son of stay at home mom Nancy Lanza. In Newtown, Connecticut's Sandy Brook elementary school, 20 year-old Adam Lanza came heavily armed and killed 20 children. Before going on a rampage at the school his mother teaches, he first set out and succeeded in assassinating his mother. The final death toll was 28. 20 children, 6 teachers, the mother, and the perpetrator. Dr. H. Wayne Carver II, the state's chief medical examiner, stated it was \"the worst I have seen.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Turkey Raids Villages for Drugs[/color][/b]\nOver five villages in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir were raided by Turkish police, armed soldiers and special ops. The raid was successful in seizing 22.5 million dollars in marijuana. They were also successful in taking weapons, rounds and ammonium nitrate. Turkey has stated that the weapons and drugs are a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers Party. Diyarbakir Governor Mustafa said, \"The income obtained from drugs is sent to Kandil ... The organization is earning a significant income though these drugs.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Canadian Killer Released [/b][/color]\nGuy Turcotte's release from prison has sparked outrage from many Canadian citizens. Turcotte was a cardiologist who admitted to killing his own children in their sleep in 2009. The man who stabbed his children to death violently and repeatedly is now a free man after serving 46 months in prison. The mother of the children remarked, \"I knew it was not a short death. You know, my little boy received 20 stabs of a knife, he had seven marks of defense...My little girl, she had 19 wounds, maybe she was luckier? Because she had one that was more mortal than the other. But she felt 19 shots, that's for sure.\" Many opponents have objected to his release. The Canadian government even officially announced that it was \"unacceptable.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nGoogle Maps is back in iOS with its newly redesigned interface, turn-by-turn directions with voice, Street View, more points of interest and increased accuracy. The cons are that it doesn't have a dedicated iPad app like Android so restoration to a smaller screen or expanding to iPad's full size with the help of pixel doubling is required. Also, this doesn't integrate the smartphone's contacts list as Apple Maps app does. Overall, Google Maps is great and handy for all iOS 6 users and it's been considered to be the best navigation app for Apple users to date. Apple has enabled Gift option with which you can directly buy and send someone any app. It was present in iOS 5 previously as well. Meanwhile, certain reports say that Apple is facing a new situation that would lead them to lose their sales in large amounts by 2013 and 2014. This has been bought into knowledge by UBS analyst Steven Milunovich.\n\n[color=white][b]Google[/b][/color]\nAt Google, Stephen Colbert was interviewed by Google's Eric Schmidt. Stephen Colbert, a political philosopher who appeared at Google to push his masterwork \"America Again: Re-Becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't.\" He wanted people to go to their local bookstore or to the \"one that's named after the rain forest.\" Eric said Colbert said this book is onto Go sales merely on Google Play. Colbert was quite surprised on hearing this because Google Play is meant to sell e-books and not physical books. Meanwhile, Google Chrome is developing a new project in order to increase its search results. The developer's version is set onto this project so it's expected to result in some slight changes. David Holloway, Google software engineer posted in his blog announcing that this change is intended to enable it for their users to search in their preferred search engines instead of the location bar.\n\n[color=white][b]Walmart[/b][/color]\nWalmart has a great price offer on Apple products for this holiday.

Producer Bob Ezrin worked with the band in Nashville to record and mix the album, following a variety of songwriting sessions in Europe. The release date is set for April 26, 2013. The album is said to bring a fresh and modern production to the original spirit of group's 70s sound. Ian Gillan has recently revealed a few working titles of songs such as 'Out Of Hands', 'Uncommon Man' and 'Hell to Pay' that might appear on the album. Earlier this year, the band and their fans mourned the loss of co-founder and original keyboardist, Jon Lord, who passed away in July. Deep Purple will be in Australia and New Zealand in February and March of next year. It will be the first time ever in Australia for the U.S. band Journey, who will be touring with them.\n\n[b][color=white] Paul McCartney Rocks Madison Square with Nirvana [/color][/b]\nThe 12/12/12 Concert at New York's Madison Square Garden has had a lot of great shows, but none more unusual than former Beatle Paul McCartney teaming up with surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic which brought the show to a close. McCartney opened his show with Helter Skelter before playing a few Wings tunes. Diana Krall helped him out for My Valentine off his 2012 album Kisses on the Bottom. He told a story of how a few guys asked him to come jam, and it wasn't long before he realised that he was 'in the middle of a Nirvana reunion'. Introducing Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and touring guitarist (and current Foo Fighter) Pat Smear. They blasted through a new song Cut Me Some Slack before disappearing and leaving his usual (and let's face it, excellent) band to sound a bit soft by comparison. Alicia Keys closed the show with the help of McCartney's band playing the Jay-Z song she collaborated on: Empire State of Mind while the stage was filled with fire fighters and other New Yorkers while Paul McCartney danced away\n[b][color=white]  [/color][/b]\n\n[b][color=white]Music Video of the Week[/color][/b]\n[spoiler][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nMy advice, whatever you do, try to make some real, solid money.",

It runs well but it is too \neasy to get rich and once your rich, you stay rich. Although as more people get rich, \nit gets harder for the poor to get more money. Also, most of the players whine and \ncomplain about it, when omniscient spends A LOT of time and money running the server \nand all they do is complain. I congratulate omni on how he runs it.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=875998][i]-The Dark Knight[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I love the HackerCraft server!

Factions costing in-game money is \na good move, because then people just won't make a faction right off the bat; they have to \nwork for it. It also puts a trust barrier on who you let into the faction.
