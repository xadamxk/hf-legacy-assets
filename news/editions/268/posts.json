Who are you exactly? What are you known for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] I'm illuminati, I'm a Canadian who really doesn't care to much about most things. I mean, leading Axiom, and shit.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Right right, you're a leader of Axiom aren't you? How'd you get that special leadership?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] I mean, Red Sox & Icy are my homies. Icy & myself had a discussion about it, and Red was talking to Icy about making me a leader for a bit, from what I understand. Another thing I guess would be I don't take shit from anyone so it works well while leading a group, plus I'm on Hack Forums quite a bit so that helps.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I see. Well, what got you started on HF? I noticed you're a 2010 member, and you've stayed with HF for quite some time now.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] A very old friend of mine that I've known since '08, (Soulessfury), recommended the forums to me. So I took his recommendation and joined the forum.. But let's be realistic, the majority of members join to learn how to hack, I can't deny, I did when I first joined Lol.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I have to agree with you on that. Well, did you ever learn how to hack like you wanted when you first joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] To be entirely honest, I didn't learn how to hack, like I wanted to. When I joined I wanted to learn how to hack everything, but that didn't happen.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] If you wanted to, would you still try to learn?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, no. I don't have the time anymore.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Well, what do you use your time now for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] When I'm not working and I have spare time I usually listen to music, watch Netflix, game, browse hf, and relax.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Have you learned anything on HF? What kept you on the forum for so long?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] I've learned a bunch on here. As for what kept me on Hack Forums, I'm not really sure I just haven't really had a reason to leave. I imagine one day I might leave, but as of right now I don't know when that will be.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] How would you compare today's HF to the HF you saw 5 years ago?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] All Im going to say is I wish I could go back to the older days.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Is there any reason why you say that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] back in like 2010-2012 it was a lot more entertaining and everyone was a lot friendlier back then. Now a days everyone tries to be \"edgy.\"\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Ah, I understand. What do you do outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] I try to keep myself entertained, but I usually skateboard, snowboard, listen to music, ride my bike, travel and stuff like that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Haha, we all need some sort of entertainment in our lives. That's all we have for today! Anything you want to say before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=white][b]illuminati▲⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯⁯:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for taking the time to interview me, and shout out to Raj Waters.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The new version adds encryption of file names and a more vulgar infection message. The new version is beginning to make its way into exploit kits. Commonly used exploit kit Nuclear Exploit Kit has added the new version to their suite of exploits. With this addition of the new version, experts expect that they will begin to see more and more exploit kits adding the new version to their suites. Experts predict the change will be progressive, as it was when transitioning from CryptoWall 2.0 to 3.0. The malware is often spread through spam as well, researchers have noted they’re beginning to see an increase in 4.0 uses in this section as well.\n\n[url=https://threatpost.com/german-government-audits-truecrypt/115441/ ][color=#FFFFFF][b]TrueCrypt Audits Continue[/b][/color][/url]\nWell known disk encryption software TrueCrypt recently underwent an audit by the German government. After its mysterious discontinuance over a year again, it has been the subject of much investigation. Many were worried that the program had been backdoored when they heard of its sudden discontinuance, but an audit performed by Google’s Open Crypto Audit Project cleared it of any backdoors in the encryption system. However, the OCAP did find that there were two critical privilege escalation vulnerabilities in TrueCrypt that were later patched in VeraCrypt. The audit performed by the German government turned up issues with the program’s RNG which puts key randomness at risk. Overall, however, the auditors concluded that the program does what it is supposed to do.\n\n[url=https://threatpost.com/starwood-hotel-chain-hit-by-point-of-sale-malware/115445/ ][color=#FFFFFF][b]Starwood Hotels Infected with POS Malware[/b][/color][/url]\nStarwood Hotels, the parent company of well-known hotels such as the Westin Hotels, the W Hotels, and the Sheraton Hotels, recently announced malware infection in 54 of their hotels. They stated that the infection was in their point-of-sale systems, but no further information was given. Most of the breaches occurred during March of 2015, however, some of them date back to 2014. The company said that the malware targeted a buyer’s personal information as well as their payment information, such as credit card numbers, expirations, and CCVs. Some hotels were infected for as short as one month whereas others were infected for up to 6 months. There does not appear to be any targeting, the hotels location ranged from Disney World to Vieques, Puerto Rico to Montreal, Canada.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/HackingNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Wires.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/11/vpn-hacking.html][b][color=white]Virtual Private Network Is Not so Private[/color][/b][/url]\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) provider Perfect Privacy happened to unearth a fatal flaw which will affect majority of the online security-savvy enthusiasts, who believe the main purpose of a VPN is to cover your tracks. In this case, a vulnerability nicknamed \"Port Fail\", allows a person to discover another person's Internet Protocol address. This flaw works by a person port forwarding and then attacking another person who uses the same VPN. Providers such as nVPN and Ovpn were alerted before-hand, and swiftly worked to resolve this vulnerability before the flaw became known. Other providers are still yet to discover and resolve this vulnerability. \n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/11/fbi-wanted-hacker.html][b][color=white]Mr.Grey Single Handedly Steals 1.2 Billion Passwords[/color][/b][/url]\nA hacker who seems to go by the alias \"Mr.Grey\", has single handedly stolen an approximation of 1.2 billion login credentials. The FBI believes this is one of the biggest thefts they have had to deal with. The nature of the stolen credentials are still yet to be determined by the FBI, and it is still unclear whether Mr.Grey managed to obtain the credentials all at once. The security analysts \"Hold Security\", has also confirmed that this was the same technique used to embarrass one of the largest internet providers, TalkTalk. Mr.Grey still lurks the internet hidden and waiting to be found - it seems as though the FBI are struggling to catch this attacker.\n\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2015/11/dell-says-sorry-for-installing.html][b][color=white]Dell Apologises After Release of Vulnerable Digital Certificate[/color][/b][/url]\nDell have unknowingly been releasing a security vulnerability dubbed as \"eDellRoot\" across their range of PCs. In an attempt to make a quick amends, Dell have now released a tool which is believed to remove the certificate. The certificate rendered HTTPS-protected sites useless. The company has denied the claim that the certificate was put in place as malware, but as a means of quick support and customer service. Dell has now pushed out an update (as of November 24) which will detect and remove any trace of the certificate.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/GamingNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Premortal.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/11/26/ps4-media-player-update-1-50-improves-stability-adds-display-mode-videos/][b][color=white]Playstation 4 Media Players Receives Small Update[/color][/b][/url]\nOn November 25, Sony released an update that added some new changes to the Playstation 4's media player application. The media player has been notorious for its bugginess and issues with crashing since the Playstation 4 was first released. Found in this update are improvements regarding the closed captioning for videos along with Arabic language support. The update also claims to improve the stability of the media player, but that has yet to be tested over an extended time period by console owners. Both Display Mode for videos and the location of media in Recently Played and Favorites have also been added.\n\n[url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/11/24/playstation-4-sales-surpass-30-2-million-units-worldwide/179348/][b][color=white]Playstation 4 Unit Sales Pass Thirty Million[/color][/b][/url]\nOn November 24, Sony Computer Entertainment confirmed that the Playstation 4 console had sold over 30 million cumulative units as of November 22 2015. A series of statements from Sony came with the news, one of which maintained the following: [url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/11/24/playstation-4-sales-surpass-30-2-million-units-worldwide/179348/]“We are sincerely grateful that gamers across the globe have continued to choose PS4 as the best place to play since launch two years ago,’ said Andrew House, President and Global CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. ‘We are committed to bringing engaging games and entertainment services to users worldwide. Thanks to the support of our partners, PS4 continues to be the premier platform for game and interactive entertainment innovation.”[/url] This upcoming holiday season the Playstation 4’s game library will continue to expand with titles such as Dragon Quest Builders, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, and Gravity Rush Remastered. The Playstation 4 is currently available in 124 different countries.\n\n[url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/27/9807480/multiplayer-comes-to-plague-inc-offering-rival-global-epidemics][b][color=white]Multiplayer Introduced to Plague Inc.[/color][/b][/url]\nPlague Inc. is a game that pits players with the task of wiping out humanity with a disease that the player creates and develops as the game progresses. Released initially on mobile platforms in 2012, this game is now having a multiplayer aspect added to it. The game’s creator, James Vaughan, said the following about the newly introduced multiplayer: [url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/27/9807480/multiplayer-comes-to-plague-inc-offering-rival-global-epidemics]\"Players get all new evolutions, abilities and genes to help them in their struggle for dominance as well as slowing their opponent. Single player was just the start of the outbreak.\"[/url] One new aspect of gameplay present in multiplayer is the ability to send hordes of infected people to other countries to try and widen the spread of your own disease over your opponent’s. Multiplayer is currently only available on the Xbox One and PC platforms of Plague Inc. \n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align] \n\n[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/world/europe/turkey-syria-russia-military-plane.html?_r=0][b][color=#FFFFFF]Turkey Shoots Down Russian Fighter Jet[/color][/b][/url] \nAfter months of rising tensions between Russia and Turkey, the situation escalated last Tuesday when the Turkish military shot down a Russian fighter jet. While Russia claims that the jet was flying over Syria, Turkey claims that it entered their airspace. Both countries are involved in the fight against ISIS, however they back different efforts regarding the reign of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Turkey is a part of the U.S. backed coalition to remove Assad from power, while Russia supports him. The incident is believed to have been the first time a NATO country has shot down a Russian plane in over 50 years. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that the attack on the plane was a “stab in the back delivered by the accomplices of terrorists,” saying that it would have “serious consequences for Russian-Turkish relations.” In an emergency NATO meeting, Turkish officials played an audio recording of the Turkish pilots warning the Russian plane, with no response.\n\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34950261][b][color=#FFFFFF]Three Killed in Planned Parenthood Clinic Shooting[/color][/b][/url] \nTwo civilians and one police officer were killed, when a lone gunman entered a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, and began to fire on civilians. A nearby hair salon manager told authorities that she had heard up to 20 gunshots in the span of five minutes. The suspect was arrested after a standoff with the police, in which one officer, Garrett Swasey was killed. The shooter has been identified as Robert Lewis Dear, from North Carolina. No further details are available, and it is still unclear what the motivation for the attack was. Planned Parenthood issued a statement saying it was not yet clear \"if Planned Parenthood was in fact the target of this attack\". Planned Parenthood is a health care non-profit organization known primarily for performing abortions, and their practices have drawn various levels of protest, and sometimes even violence over the years. Nine others were injured in the event, including five police officers.\n\n[url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/roman-polanski-definitely-wont-be-extradited-u-s-n470281][b][color=#FFFFFF]Roman Polanski Extradition Finally Denied[/color][/b][/url] \nRoman Polanski, an 82-year-old Oscar-winning film director, plead guilty in 1977 to having sex with a thirteen year old girl on a photo shoot. He served 42 days in jail after his plea bargain. Once he believed that he would end up in prison for years, Polanski fled the country first to Britain, and then to France. The filmmaker lives in Paris, and holds an apartment in Krakow, Poland. He is a dual citizen of France and Poland. The United States requested extradition for Polanski after he made an appearance in Warsaw in 2014. A Polish court initially denied the extradition, and on Friday an appellate prosecutor's office said there was no justification to appeal the decision, which made the denial final. One of Polanski's lawyers said \"Speaking for Polanski, I can say that we feel a great relief that this case has ended, and this means that it will be possible for Polanski to start making a planned film in Poland.\" The victim of the original case Samantha Geimer, has said in the past that she believes the exile Polanski has endured has been punishment enough.\n\n[color=transparent]     [/color]",

It was only last year when TSV DDR4 DRAM modules in 64GB were introduced by Samsung, the latest product promises significantly improved performance coupled with power efficiency to make for a compelling package for clients. As much as these are impressive though, they are designed with servers in mind, not gaming PCs. However since Samsung plans to improve things even more, upping data transfer speeds and further tweaking efficiency, it would not be surprising if someone started running some games on these sticks before long.\n\n[color=white][url=http://www.cnet.com/products/huawei-mate-8/][b]Huawei Unveils New 6-Inch Mate 8 Phablet [/b][/url][/color]\nHuawei unveiled yesterday, November 26, its new Mate 8 flagship, a 6-inch phablet that comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow pre-installed. The newly announced Mate 8 is the flagship Huawei hopes will lead its expansion across the globe, and is the successor to last year's Ascend Mate 7, on which Google based the Nexus 6P. The device also boasts Huawei’s latest Kirin 950 processor and a giant battery that lasts up to 30 percent longer than its predecessor. Huawei fans around the world will be pleased to know, however, that the release date for regions outside of China should be in the first quarter of 2016. North America will get a preview of the phone at the 2016 CES show in Law Vegas.\n\n[color=white][url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2015/11/27/ps4-destroys-xbox-one-and-chromecast-crushes-apple-tv-roku-and-amazon-fire-in-new-sales-figures/][b]PS4 Tops Xbox One in Sales for Q3[/b][/url][/color]\nA new report from Strategy Analytics, a Boston based data analytics company, has surfaced online, suggesting that during the third quarter of 2015, Sony’s PlayStation 4 had overtaken by far Microsoft’s Xbox One in sales. According to the report, global sales figures show that Sony sold more than twice as many PS4s as Microsoft sold Xbox Ones over Q3. As such, Sony has outsold Microsoft for U.S. console sales each month of 2015, with the exception of April. The  author behind the paper believes that it is still possible for the Xbox One to make a comeback until Christmas, but if and only if Microsoft follows a well-orchestrated pattern of price drops in bundles of high demand.\n[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Nobility.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Leadership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1080450][color=#EFEFEF][b]~Dec[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Divines.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1472133][color=#00AAFF][b]ChromeProducts[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Divines.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#EFEFEF][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url] is now the leader of Legends.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#00AAFF][b]-Hyperion[/b][/color][/url] was appointed as leader of The Brotherhood.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=271731][color=#EFEFEF][b]Loki123[/b][/color][/url] was appointed as leader of The Brotherhood.\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5005329][b]HF News Team // Become a Writer - Apply now![/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5054694][b]Axiom | Recruitment Phase | [Official][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4917838][b]Crypto | Official Cryptocurrency Group | Creation Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5073067][b]Echo | Programming section | Official Group - [RECRUITING][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5018163][b][LEGENDS] Official Recruitment - Network Exploitation and Programmers![/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5060818][b]Legends General Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5070037][b][Recruiting] Royalty [Official Group][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5008786][b][SPECIALISTS] General Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4932933][b]Titans | Official Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Related Buy-ins & Informational Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5011893][b]Axiom | Official Group | Re-brand Inc | Leader Spot | PP / BTC / WU [$1K][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4995862][b][Divine] || Official Group || Leadership Position Available || [$900][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5036270][b]Null | Student Program[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4970797][b]Official Group Divine[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4456035][b]Titans | Official Group[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group and Crew General Discussions Spotlight Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5069237][b][Official Group Userbar] The Black Lodge $75 BTC.[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5057633][b]Official Group \"Escrow\".
