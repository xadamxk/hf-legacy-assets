The discovery came after [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] banned the member on HackerCraft. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] then decided to run his IP through a check on HF, which lead to the discovery of his multiple accounts. All of the accounts have since been banned, and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has decided to contact the FBI regarding the scammer's enormous fraud schemes.

Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make to our readers?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: No one in particular. If anything, a big shout to The Alliance, of course. Full of great members, some awesome people and a lot of good friends.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You're one of the oldest members of the group. How did you come to be attached to it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: Heh. A few months after I first registered on HF, I wasn't really active. Back in '10, I wasn't upgraded or anything, but I applied for TA anyway. And surprisingly, a few weeks later, I got my acceptance PM. It was great! Definitely was what led me to become more active on HF and get involved in the community. I learnt a lot from the group. From the members. Becoming attached through shared knowledge, I suppose. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How much have you learned from and taught to the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: A lot. Especially over the past few months; classes being held, communal discussion of popular topics and the like. And it's not just stuff that's related to the internet or technology as a whole, but really cool, casual chats about goings-on as well. Teaching wise, I feel as if I've put a lot into the group. Obviously, the stuff I do is more tailored towards web development (amongst a few other things), so that's where I help out, or try to, the most. And it's not just within the subforum, either. Throughout the whole forum, it's great to see TA members parting knowledge.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: The web development you teach also plays into the Marketplace. How are you so successful in the Marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: A lot of people say that the HF marketplace is full of \"skids\" and stupid tools, which is partly true, but, there are a few gems amongst what's being sold. Personally, I freelance as a web developer so after doing 1-2 jobs for people, the balls gets rolling and word spreads and I get so many PMs daily asking for work. The thing I really try to promote here, though, is quality work. EVERYTHING I do will be as good as I can make it, and not something half-assed, which is why my prices are pretty high. The HF marketplace has enabled me to do so much; I've put a lot of effort into what I've done and as a result, it's made me a lot of good friends and a considerable amount of cash. I'm still in (the UK version of) college, so I don't have time for a job. It's awesome to be able to make money like this. And spending it is even better ;D HF is what paid for my phone, my laptop and my summer trip, back-packing through Europe.\nThe most important thing I've learnt from it is to stay motivated and have a goal. Something to work towards. And not something that's within your immediate reach, but something difficult. Something incredible.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How did you learn the various web languages you code in? Through experience or through the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: From the start, I've always been interested in technology. I remember making my first Freewebs website when I was like 9 :') Since then, I've just been reading tutorials online, making friends etc to improve my skills as a web designer. Up until 2009 or so (when I designed Fixee), I was a pretty bad designer, but I had a passion to learn and always improve. However, more recently, I've been getting increasingly advanced in PHP and JavaScript- HF has helped so much with that. I've learnt a lot from the forum and I hope I've given back as much as I've taken ^.^\nI remember, 2007-2008 or so, posted a site I made on a designer forum. (I was 11 at the time) I thought it was really cool and I got slated SO HARD. I got the shit ripped out of me. And that just encouraged to want to design as well as these guys. Which is why I get SO irritated when web design work or other graphic work on HF gets complimented when quite frankly, it's poor work. Meh.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: People have different perceptions of what quality work is. How do you define it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: It's pretty easy to tell the difference between something that's been done properly, and something that hasn't. As a web designer, I can tell by looking at simple things; grids, common design techniques, good design practice etc - all these skills that build up over time. It's obvious when something has been designed by someone who know what they're doing. The same can be said for development; coding standard, efficiency of code, the method used for achieving something. Although \"quality\" is very opinionated, when you've been doing something for a while and you're good at it, you can tell.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: What about people who rip others' work? How do you view rippers?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: Ugh. People who steal other people's work are the bane of my existence. If anyone rips anything that I've made, believe me, I will fuck them over. Example and point here: http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=2635259 <-- kid took my booter source, changed the name from mine to his and tried to sell it.\nIn addition to this, even worse than people who rip work is people who justify it by saying it's not worth the price. Especially when it comes to design. As a web dev, I think that web design is INFINITELY harder than programming. There's so much involved when it comes to designing a website, more than what people think. And this undervaluation really frustrates me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How much time went into developing your own booter source? What kind of technology goes into making it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: Well, the whole reason behind making it was that I wanted to fund my trip to Europe. Took around 2 days worth of work coding it. Design was something I made a couple of years back; tried to make it as simple as possible so it could be re-themed. Skills used were xHTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. Since then, I've learnt a LOT, so v2 of the source will be out soon and better than ever ;D!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Great news! How many people run your booter source?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: Unsure as of right now. I made quite a few sales; only 2-3 people on here, though. I got a ton of buyers for private booters. This was quite a while ago, so, the new version that I hope to release soon will be AMAZING ^.^\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How long has the new version taken to code?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=white][b]CarrotMilk[/b][/color][/url]: Haven't started on it yet. But it's going to be great. Including a custom payment system utilising common payment processor APIs; booter owners will be able to create their own custom packages based on numerous factors straight from their admin panel and it'll all work without any manual edits! My charge for PHP dev is $50-70/hour and this is roughly 20 hours work with all the features. If not more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Damn, bro. You'll certainly roll in the dough.

From there I became interested in vectoring and went on developing my own technique and posting everything I created in the RMG section. Practice is really how I learned and I'm still learning with everything I create. I've applied for the GraphicMasters student program and I'm pretty much just going to keep practicing and developing my style.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Hopefully you can reach a level of expertise that you wish. Practice is indeed the greatest learning tool. What programs do you use and what specifically do you use them for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  I use Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Illustrator CS4. Photoshop is the go-to program for graphic work such as signatures, thread designs, digital paintings, etc. Whereas Illustrator is the ideal program for vectoring. They both have their pros and cons which I won't go into in detail, but I find myself using Photoshop more frequently than Illustrator.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: What kind of motivation do you have for your work? Do you usually just sit down and create something, or do you use some kind of stimulus? Could you explain what stimulus (if any) you used for your last few projects?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  I almost never have any ulterior motive for what I do besides the fact that I just [i]like[/i] digital art. I've always had this affinity for digital creation. I used to animate in Adobe Flash quite a bit and I just loved the way the animation turned out once finished. It's the same way with my vectors. I guess you could say that whenever I create something new it's practice and I learn and improve from it. Digital art is just something I've always enjoyed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Great to hear. I'm aware there are many GFX forums out there. Why did you choose HF over GFX forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  I was never a member of a forum until I was introduced to HF by Anxtrist (whom I know IRL). I had already purchased l33t when I realized there were other forums for graphics out there, and it still seemed like everyone on HF was better than me at graphics anyways. I just didn't have the will to switch from an active forum which I enjoyed to a less active forum focused around a single subject. I have an account over at GFXforums.net but I never visit that site because it's extremely inactive.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: The GFX section on HF is extremely active for a forum centralised around hacking, I must admit. What other skills and/or hobbies do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  I love playing the drums. I've been playing for three years and I jam on 'em every day. I also play soccer and lacrosse. Apart from that, one of my biggest pasttimes is playing videogames. As you very well know I actively play Minecraft and it's one of my favorite games, along with Halo, League of Legends, and old Nintendo games. Can't go wrong with Pokémon on the gameboy!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Do you have a sound-proof room, or do you simply play the drums in your house? Does it get your family or neighbours annoyed? How do they cope with the noise without breaking your drumkit?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  I have a little brother and sister and they could care less, they make more noise themselves anyways. My grandparents also live in the same house and they sleep a lot, so I actually only have certain time slots when I can play. My parents don't mind when I practice the drums either, and I live on a fairly big lot so playing the drums doesn't affect my neighbors at all.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Oh well that's a plus. I know I couldn't do that without annoying a lot of people. Do you have any HF-related goals currently, excluding the GM student program? If so, what are they?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  Not specifically, however I always try to contribute a little. Most of my contributions towards HF are in the form of criticism in the Rate my Graphic section as well as contributions for Infamous. I'm actually writing a tutorial on vectoring as we speak, which should be published by the time this edition of the news is out. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Sounds good. Thanks for your time today BagHead and thanks for the interview. Any final comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][color=white][b]BagHead[/b][/color][/url]:  I like cheese.\n[/spoiler]",

The story, as described on the thread published by Omniscient, states that Omni teleported firtlast [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876](Phytrix)[/url] into his base to show it off. Later, firtlast walked back and set a home. DoNtCaReAnY1, coolkilla202 and firtlast, then poured lava on the roof and created multiple cobblestone pillars. Omni returned home during the act, proceeding to promptly kick them off the server. They logged back on and talked with Omni (some say they were whining, some say apologizing) for a while. These members (firtlast and coolkilla202) were then banned from forum as well as repfucked, while all received bans from HackerCraft and full refunds were given for HackerCraft purchases in the last 60 days. One of the repercussions of the incident is the automatic disbanding of the faction Wolves due to firtlast, the faction owner, being banned. Wolves was considered by many one of the top factions of the server and will be missed. Full chat logs from the incident as well as Omniscient's statement can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3164553][u]here[/u][/url].\n\n[b][color=white]CHAD Disbanded, Server Flooded With Alts[/color][/b]\nCHAD, previously a very powerful faction with a large presence on the server, was disbanded. Members of the faction were spam logging onto the server with alternative accounts all day, annoying many players. At first this was thought to be just an attack by a member, however there was an ulterior motive behind the action; CHAD was sending the initial 100IGM, granted to new players when they first log in, to players of their faction thus raising the faction balance to an unrealistic number. They also collected the new member kits. This exploitative method of gaining IGM earned CHAD a kick from the server, causing many members to quit and migrate to different servers. The members who stayed joined Cobalt, who in turn changed their faction name to Chad. To prevent an exploit such as this from happening again the starting balance for new players was changed from 100IGM to 10IGM, while the starter kit was also changed.

Xbox 360 Achievements has obtained a full list of 50 achievements for the unannounced game. Capcom has not announced Resident Evil: Revelation for Xbox 360 and the publisher of the game has not commented on the rumor, so as we all know, that confirms it within itself. However, even if there isn't much new content on the Xbox 360 version, it shows that Capcom is widening its approach, and going after those big consoles again. Let's hope they continue to do that.\n\n[color=white][b] Far Cry 3 ‘High Tides’ DLC Release[/b][/color]\nThe first expansion for Far Cry 3 will be released on January 15th, 2013, starting off where the last six chapters ended. This expansion includes two new co-op chapters called Jailbreak and Redemption. While it is unclear how much it will cost, we do know that the PS3 console is the only platform it will be released on for the the time-being. No announcements or statements have been made about whether or not this expansion will be ported to the PC or Xbox 360. We can only hope.\n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft series sold 15 million in 2012[/b][/color]\nMinecraft has announced their sales record last year of 2012 and it came to 15 million including the Pocket Edition (iOS, Android) performing better than all others at 5,899,727. Minecraft for the Xbox 360 was the next best performing version during 2012, recording sales of 5,002,370. For starting out as a small, unknown indie game, Minecraft has really taken the world by storm. Mojang hit a real win here, and they will probably sell even more copies as they expand their options, platforms, and possibilities.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the week:[/b][/color]\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcE_aKPXIlg[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1NYPH[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Syrian Government Murders 36 People[/color][/b]\nSyrian military forces have murdered 36 people on Sunday on the borders of Damascus. The 36 deaths are reported to include 14 children. There was a video recording that showed dismembered bodies of what used to be lively children in Eastern Ghouta. With the conflict becoming increasingly deadly, the Russian government has pushed for the rebels to have talks with President Bashar al-Assad to end the fighting. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying, \"If I were in the opposition's shoes, I would come up with my ideas in response on how to establish a dialogue.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Another Devastating Rape in India[/color][/b]\nIn the Indian Gurdaspur district in Punjab, it seems as though there has been another rape incident that is grabbing worldwide attention. There is said to be seven suspects who raped a women on a bus on a night this weekend. Authorities have arrested six of the suspects already. The bus driver was included as one of those arrested for raping the married woman who is almost 30. The v[i]i[/i]ctim had stated, \"They threatened me with a sharp edged weapon and did wrong things with me. They kept me confined all through the night and forced me to do what they want.\" The rape is a chilling reminder of the gang rape in India that sparked national debates last month. Here is a picture of the arrested men: http://goo.gl/cE1Za\n\n[b][color=white]Former Egyptian President Back on Trial[/color][/b]\nFormer Egyptian President Honsi Mubarak was previously handed a life sentence, but the appeals courts have demanded a retrial. The trial stems for the death of hundreds of activists during the 2011 revolution. However, the former president will remain in custody, because there is a current investigation on him for a different event. The judge of the previous case which Mubarak stood trial proclaimed that the prosecuting lawyers presented insufficient evidence to actually prove their case, yet he was still given a life sentence. This is a sticky situation for current President Mohammed Morsi, because many supporters of Mubarak were enraged that he was sentenced for not causing the murders but simply not preventing them.\n\n[b][color=white]Roadside Bomb Kills Pakistani Soldiers[/color][/b]\nA roadside bomb that struck a Pakistani convey resulted in the deaths of 14 soldiers and left 20 others wounded. The deadly bombings was one of the worst attacks against the Pakistani soldiers and occured in the North Waziristan tribal area.The area is a safe haven for many Al Qaeda and Taliban militants who are currently the government's opposition. The Pakistani officials were limited in what they could tell reporters, but the bombing obliterated two vehicles and caused damage to another one.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1NYQz[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Gaming Addiction[/color][/b]\nIn China, Mr.Feng, father of Feng Jr, appointed virtual assassins to take down his son's addiction to PC games. Feng Jr didn't do well at school nor did he find himself a job. He has been claiming himself to be the kind of video games. His dad decided to take a radical approach to take down his son's addiction, so he appointed a few people who play online to kill his son's game character. But his son after playing reported, \"I can play or I can not play, it doesn't bother me. I'm not looking for any job -- I want to take some time to find one that suits me.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Twitter[/color][/b]\nThe U.S Congress announced that they have provided over 170 billion tweets while live streaming since 2010. The U.S library made an announcement today regarding this: \"Twitter is a new kind of collection for the Library of Congress but an important one to its mission. As society turns to social media as a primary method of communication and creative expression, social media is supplementing, and in some cases supplanting, letters, journals, serial publications, and other sources routinely collected by research libraries. Though the Library has been building and stabilizing the archive and has not yet offered researchers access, we have nevertheless received approximately 400 inquiries from researchers all over the world. Some broad topics of interest expressed by researchers run from patterns in the rise of citizen journalism and elected officials' communications to tracking vaccination rates and predicting stock market activity.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Apple[/color][/b]\nAn analyst reports that Apple might release an iPhone mini in the next few years to overcome the battle between Samsung and Apple. The analyst made a report to CNET: \"We believe Apple will have to launch an 'iPhone Mini' at some point over the next three years to address the hundreds of millions of prepaid users worldwide that cannot afford the current iPhone. The iPhone 5 is growing fast and profitably right now, so there is limited incentive for Apple to launch a profit-squeezing 'iPhone Mini' this year. We expect the 'iPhone Mini' to be more likely next year, in 2014, when Apple's penetration of the global postpaid smartphone market will be nearing saturation and Apple will be forced to discover fresh growth streams elsewhere.\" However, other reports says that Samsung will be releasing Samsung Galaxy S4 this year.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1NYR4[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Taylor Swift's Breakup Songs: Is Harry Styles Next?[/b][/color]\nTaylor Swift is well known for making songs about her breakups.
