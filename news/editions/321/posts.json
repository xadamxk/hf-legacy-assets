Before we start, of course - are there any shout outs you'd like to make?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] Hello there!\nI would like to shout out everyone around Aequitas and my buddies on HF.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Aequitas is your group you plan on releasing soon correct? What made you want to make the transition to group ownership?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, that is indeed the name of the group. I wanted to show some love for HF by providing a great learning environment within the field of cyber security, and so here we are.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] What made you decide to base it around cyber security in specific?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] I think HF has way too many youngsters that are interested in making a quick buck here and there, and are willing to risk their future by doing so in illegal ways. This made me want to start this group and focus on the whitehat side of hacking.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] That's great. You said you want it to be based around knowledge, so are you planning on creating any teaching programs? If so, will they be paid like usual or offered to members for free?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/url] I do not believe any knowledge should be hidden for only the people who have the money to pay for it. Thus the group will be absolutely free to join, but there will most likely be an option to donate for the users that want to do so.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity[/b][/color][/url] I figured you'd do it like that. Those programs that ask for money seem to be mostly for profit, not actual teaching. How's the hunt for graphics been going?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104[color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] I fully agree that a lot of groups are in it for the profit. Aequitas is not a group to make profit and will likely never be. The hunt for graphics has begun, and I am beginning to see some nice entries. I have a pretty clear vision of what I want, but no one has yet to hit the nail on the head.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Are you planning on keeping the contest going until you are ready to rebrand or will you choose a winner as soon as you see one you love? Also - include the link to the contest here so graphic designers who may be reading this can give it a shot.\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/url] I am planning to keep it open for as long as needed. However, I really want it to be ready on day one that I buy a group which is why I posted the thread before I even bought a group.\nhttps://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5488780\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Well good luck with that - I hope you find a nice userbar! Aside from the big group project you got coming up early next year, do you have any personal projects in progress to accompany your VPN service?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] I do not have any other personal projects besides Dicta.io. I've spent a lot of time planning Aequitas so I am putting a lot of effort and time into it.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Well, it sounds like it's going to be a group to look out for. The group atmosphere is currently in some shambles, so hopefully the new groups coming out will bring active life. What's your thoughts on the current state of groups?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104][color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed the current groups are not that stable. I think most of the groups are either there just to create a community and have fun, while a few others are in it for the profit. I hope to change the state of groups by bringing the qualities of Aequitas, and hopefully, some of the new group owners can help me change it too.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=magenta][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'm definitely willing to work with you, can't wait to have you join the ownership club! Thanks so much for letting me interview you. Before I end it, is there anything you'd like to leave us with?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=275104[color=white][b]ra1d:[/b][/color][/url] I can not wait to get started with Aequitas. We'll have a lot of stuff happening on our website at http://aequitas.io So be on the look out!\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color][/size][/font]",

According to the Airparif agency, which measures levels of air pollution, the city is experiencing its worst pollution levels in 10 years. In addition to decreasing the pollution levels through free transit, the city is also enforcing driving restrictions based on odd or even-numbered license plate numbers. During the past week, permission for driving switched daily between vehicle owners based on license plate numbers. If a person was found driving their car on a day the restriction was enforced on their license plate number, they were fined up to €35. Vehicles that are hybrid, electric, or carrying more than three people are unaffected by the enforcement.

From their perspective, circumcision should be “an informed, personal choice” that young men make for themselves. The organization believes circumcision robs boys from their ability to make decisions about their own bodies, so they are taking measures to restrict it. The initiative for an outright ban was considered, but the doctors think a total ban could have some negative consequences when the procedure is medically necessary. Beginning in 2017, all circumcisions will need to be reported to Denmark’s national patient registry. Polls show that around 87% of Danes support banning the practice on boys under the age of 18.[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-considering-banning-circumcision-for-children-under-18s-a7459291.html] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]President of South Korea Impeached[/color][/b]\r\nJust as South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye reached approval ratings of 4%, the nation’s National Assembly has formally impeached their president. Park is accused of being involved in a major corruption scandal, and large public outcry has been the response. The vote for impeachment needed two-thirds of congress for approval, and the final tally was successful at 234 to 56. Although the measure has passed congress, it will not become effective until ratified by the nation’s Constitutional Court. In the interim, the nation’s prime minister takes over Park’s responsibilities.

Later this week, Samsung has claimed they will push a final update to many remaining US Note 7 devices that will prevent them from charging, effectively making them bricks after the battery dies. As of now, the update is confirmed for carrier US Cellular, whose users received a text telling them of the update. Last month, many Note 7's on major carriers saw updates sent out by Samsung that limited the charging to 60 percent battery life, but no other US mobile providers have confirmed a complete bricking of Note 7 devices. Those who still wish to exchange their unit are still able to do so directly through the company.\r\n\r\n[url=https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/][b]Smart Watch Maker Pebble Closes Down, Acquired by FitBit[/b][/url]\r\nIf you have been a follower of smart gadgets for a few years, Pebble is a name you may more than likely be familiar with. Being one of the large innovators of smart watch technology, many were left in shock when they announced that they would be completely stopping all sales, promotion, and manufacturing of their fairly successful watches. On their official website, Pebble has made a statement that although shutting down, Pebble as a whole has been acquired by exercise wearable maker FitBit. This means that along with tech and software acquisition, a number of those working on the Pebble will also be moving to the FitBit team. Pebble's final statement may be found on their website.\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/05/amazon-go-grocery-store/?sr_source=Twitter][b]Amazon Testing Physical Grocery Store, No Checkout Lines: [/b][/url]\r\nWe all go pick things up at the grocery store every week or so and go through the same routine of waiting for the three people with 40 items in the 10 items or less line, only to finally finish checking out half an hour later. Amazon has announced a very creative approach to a typical grocery store, where instead of suffering in a long line, you can simply walk out. Amazon's grocery store Amazon Go, will scan your device to get your account information, and once inside the store, you can grab things, and your digital cart will register everything you pick up. From there, shoppers just get what they need, and upon walking out the doors, they are charged for items they've picked up. Their announcement claims the Grocery Store uses a deep learning algorithm and other technology to know when you pull things off the shelf and put them into your bag. The first Amazon Go grocery store will be opening in Seattle Washington, and will only be available for Amazon employees until eventually rolling out to everyone in early 2017.\r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color][/size][/font]",

In August, Raistlin made his plans public online and subsequently murdered his grandfather minutes later. “The court docs show the North Carolina teen had been chatting on the Canadian app Kik before the murder — under the handle EtherealSkull — telling a fellow user that he planned to kill his grandfather, even sharing photos of the gloves he wore and the hatchet he was going to use to commit the crime.” In addition to letting others know about his plans, he made it clear to those on Kik that he was going to get a mediocre sentence as he is a minor. Raistlin is expected to be in court tomorrow morning. He is facing a single charge of first-degree murder.\r\n\r\n[b][url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pewdiepie-decides-against-delete-youtube-channel-a7468036.html][color=#FFFFFF]PewDiePie Keeps Account[/color][/url]\r\n[/b]The Swedish YouTube star came out of the woodwork not too long ago and made it clear that he was going to delete his account at 50M subscribers. He was named the highest-paid YouTuber by Forbes this year. With this in mind, followers and fans alike questioned whether he was serious or not. Come to find out, he will not be deleting his YouTube account after all. PewDiePie, also known as Felix Kjellberg noted “You know when you make a joke and it just blows up way bigger than you ever imagine. This was covered by media everywhere - the fact that I said I was going to delete my channel”. PewDiePie will stick around and will continue to pump out video after video per usual. \r\n\r\n[b][url=http://fox59.com/2016/12/11/viral-video-shows-man-punch-kangaroo-in-the-face-to-save-dog/][color=#FFFFFF]Man Punches Kangaroo[/color][/url]\r\n[/b]A video surfaced online that showed a man lunging towards a kangaroo. Upon viewing the video, it becomes evident that the kangaroo has the man's dog in a chokehold. The man jogs towards the kangaroo. Once up close and personal with the kangaroo, the dog was released and subsequently had run. The man proceeded to punch the kangaroo in the face and then backpedaled back to safety. “You can see the dog trying to escape, wanting nothing to do with the kangaroo. The big buck kangaroo releases the dog when the owner gets close but then moves in to try and attack the human.” It was a bizarre story but was confirmed to be accurate. As soon as the man hit the kangaroo, it was clear that the animal was shocked. Hence why many thought the video was fake.
