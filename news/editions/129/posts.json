As well as having a partner who helped with the overall cost of $4000 USD. He ended up getting himself in too deep, when [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1233686][color=#0066FF][b]Sandshrew[/b][/color][/url] struggled to pay back his loans by the deadline, things were looking down for him. Multiple scam reports were launched on [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1233686][color=#0066FF][b]Sandshrew[/b][/color][/url] along with community alerts. After failing to pay back the debts by the deadline, one of the people who loaned [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1233686][color=#0066FF][b]Sandshrew[/b][/color][/url] $620 was [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b]Tibit[/b][/url] the now closed scam report can be found by [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3226734][b]clicking here[/b][/url]. 'The Angels' has now been reverted back to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][b]Hexicidal[/b][/url]. The group still holds the name 'The Angels', but should be changed in the near future. We are currently unsure if [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][b]Hexicidal[/b][/url] plans on selling the group again, or has given up to avoid the dramatic side of things. We are pretty confident changes will be coming to 'The Angels' soon to say the least.\n\n[color=white][b]L33T/UB3R Database Leak[/b][/color]\nRecently it has been announced by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] that the L33T and UB3R database has been leaked.

There was a breach where the information of the members who purchased l33t and ub3r were stored. The website owned by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] himself \"Witza\" is the name of the site that was breached. We currently do not know who did this. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] does not want to release this information for obvious reasons.

Firstly, do you have any shutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: Firstly, thanks for interviewing me Adam. I'd like to shout out everyone from The Empire because they're awesome people.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I apologize if I mess up at anytime through this, I'm a bit new to this! So let's start from the beginning shall we? What brought you to HF in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: Well, it might sound a bit silly but I joined HF looking to learn about how to make an .exe file into a .jar file to step up my game in RAT spreading. I was a total noob back then. I've learned so much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: That is a very popular response from members. What subject do you think you have learned most about from Hack Forums? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I've mainly learned and mastered Photoshop, RATs, monetizing and some basic web design which I can combine with my PS skills to create decent websites. I have yet to learn C++, which is my next goal. Since I have many projects, I will probably postpone this until summer.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: [7:27:30 PM] Sounds like you have done a lot on the forums! What are some of your well known projects?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I am currently running the HF Username Style Changer(link to the thread?). It's a userscript that adds glow to your username. I haven't had much time to work on it lately but I have good plans for it in the future. Otherwise, I've given away many ebooks that I have written which have gotten over 5,000 downloads altogether. I also try and do my best on the forums to help other members. If someone needs help, they can always send me a private message and I'll do my best to help them out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Wow! Sounds to me you enjoy helping members out! Many of your projects include some terrific GFX talents. With that being said, do you have interest in the group called \"Graphic Masters\" ?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I sure do. I've considered applying but many things stand in my way; one obstacle would be that I don't do GFX for fun, but more when I need it. I have other hobbies for now but I do enjoy designing stuff on photoshop from time to time. The Graphic Masters' latest recruitment was, I believe, the GM Students Recruitment for which, sadly, I didn't have time. Too many school projects stood between me and the program. Otherwise, I believe I could apply the next time they are recruiting. Hopefully the leaders will like my work. \nFor now, I'm only in The Empire and my experience has been amazing, I love it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I notice you are a fellow member of the Empire, with that being your first group, is it anything you expected?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I was never really interested in joining a group before 2013. After I got in the Empire, I found out that being part of a group is an amazing experience and I will never regret being in it. The members are very friendly and always help each other out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I agree. Anyone who hasn't already, I highly suggest trying your all when applying for a group. We already mentioned the Graphics Masters, but are there any other groups you have wanted to join? And any particular reason for doing so?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: Well, ever since I joined HF I've always looked up to the Red Lions because of their quality and their motto: \"We are a group of giving and never receiving\". Some other groups I'd love to join are The Alliance because of my knowledge in computers and 143 because I feel like the atmosphere in the subforum is amazing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I'm right there with you for the Red Lions! Well I think I am closing up this interview, do you have any last words? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=white][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I want to thank Tibit for accepting me in my first group, I will be forever thankful. I'd also like to thank everyone who has supported me on HF and thank you for interviewing me Adam!\n[/Spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Interview[/size][/font][/color] [color=white]-[/color] [font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063]Aeon ‹3[/url][/size][/font][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: For the 129th edition of the HF News, we have fought our way through the trenches and landmines to talk with Aeon. Any shoutouts or comments before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: I'll give a shout to Tibit, my partner in crime; Daisy, an extremely kind person and great friend over the past month; Froggy, another person who I've gotten closer to lately; Lastly, Judge Dredd, simply because he is a damn bully.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How do you get the ideas for your products? Input from your customer base or do you go back and forth with Tibit?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: Mostly we just go back and forth. It takes us quite awhile to actually decide on an idea. For days or weeks even, we will spit out different products we think can be profitable and then research them. We take a big amount of time looking into each products' market, how and where to advertise, estimate our financial expense over profits. We take some input from friends or even just look through a few different forums to see what people want in the market. Other than that, it is all us.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do you code your products from hand or hire others to create it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: It really depends what product we decide to release. Most if not all of our products will be coded solely by myself. I am the backend of our products while Tibit is our front end, marketer, and advertiser. I grew up as a kid learning a lot of programming so it comes easy to me now when I need it. If I don't know how to do something, I'll go ask someone I do know has the knowledge for some help, but I would rather have my products coded by me so I know everything works and is efficient.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Awesome stuff. What are the different projects you've worked on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: Personally, I've worked on different projects from Websites to networking, to firewall intrusion and solutions, etc. I keep busy when I can with Tibit working on Malware programs and pen testing servers and websites trying to find vulnerabilities. The best is yet to come though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Guess we got stuff in store. What brought you to Hack Forums, what made you join so that I am chatting with you now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: I joined in 2009 as a 16 year old kid. I believe I joined back then to do things with command prompt and batch at school. Fun days messing with a teacher because my cd drive won't stop open/closing. I lost interest and moved on with my life until June of 2012. I decided to come by for a visit, see what has changed. Quickly after I got back into it, I started making some money and meeting people. Before I had even realized, I was sucked into the HF life because of the people around me. Without those few people, I wouldn't see a point of being here anymore.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You have quite an interesting history... More colorful than mine. How do you find the time to come to HF while deployed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: My activity sways a lot. There are days where I will sit on base almost the entire day with nothing to do, so I pull out a laptop or go to the phones to call my fiance. Other times I am inactive from HF for day(s) to week(s) because I don't see base at all and I'm out on a mission. Lately I haven't had much time on HF, but I try to get on when I can to make sure what I need to manage is managed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How would we know if anything happened to our lovable Aeon? :c\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: You would see me go offline for months. I talk to a couple people from here regularly when I get the chance, so they would be the first to know.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Great to hear. What prompted you to fight for your country?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: It's a very long and personal story which members of Empire and Corporation were able to read about. I don't talk about my life with many people, so anyone outside those SF won't ever know the answer to this question.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: I respect your privacy. You're attached to your groups and love the members. What kind of things can we expect from them in the future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: Well as you know, Corporation is gone... We didn't have enough time to give to the group. I've lost a lot of interest in Empire but the group is picking back up its quality. I see a lot of inspiring threads in the SF and upcoming contests and projects some members are working on. Obviously can't give out SF detail, but some good stuff is coming from them.\nI recently got invited into 143 and think a lot about the members in this group. It is definitely a loving family group of people, always positive and respectful. I have become really good friends with Daisy, also with Cody, and a few other members in this group. I see a lot of potential from these members as well, they are always striving to help someone in need. I expect big things to keep coming from them as well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad we have some potential on the horizon. That's all the time we have... Any last comments or shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=white][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url]: I'll thank Tibit, Daisy, and Froggy again. They are the reasons I am even on this site anymore. Thanks for the interview as well.\n[/spoiler]",

A progressive update leading up to Minecraft 1.5, 13w06a's changelog consists mostly of bug fixes. There are, however, a few notable changes; firstly, it is now possible to sprint up stairs! This change should bring a smile to the faces of many. Another notable addition is the spawner minecart. As you can probably guess, the spawner minecart is a minecart with, well, a spawner within it. This is the second new minecart to be introduced in 1.5, along with the TNT minecart which was introduced a few weeks ago. Along with this, a few more lighting optimizations have also been introduced to the new lighting engine which we'll have the pleasure of testing once 1.5 is official. This new engine brings many lighting fixes, particularly with stairs and half slabs. Light can now pass through the spaces between stairs; the intensity of light scales with the size of the opening which light can pass through. We can also say goodbye to the ever despised half slab lighting glitch with the coming of the new lighting engine.

Holynick had been working hard on getting the build world ready for the public for months prior to the official opening. There were many issues with plugins from the PvP world and the build world interfering with each other; this is one of the main reasons the build world took so long to officially open. The Build World was also open for a very small window of time around New Years, however due to various problems it was closed to the public. The build world has been running smoothly so far and a few players have managed to create some impressive designs with their small plots. The server owes many of its new and active players to the opening of the build world.

HackerCraft is still having a rough time gaining its player base back, however many say that the addition of the build world is a step in the right direction.\n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft: Pocket Edition version 0.6[/b][/color]\nFor you minecrafters who enjoy playing on the go, you'll be happy to hear that a new update has recently been released for the mobile version of Minecraft! Version 0.6.0, available now for all iOS and android devices, is quite an exciting update for the mobile game. Although the pocket edition still has quite a ways to go until it even has nearly as many features as the computer version, the latest update has introduced a few mechanics unavailable to mobile players until now. New features added in 0.6.0 include armor, baby animals, signs, improvements to stairs and half slabs, and some new blocks. One of the new blocks added is the nether quartz block, a building block which not even PC players officially have access to yet!

Featuring over a dozen different survival game arenas in-game at all times, it's easy to jump into a match whenever you'd like. If you're not familiar with the survival games gametype, it's a  minigame inspired by the hunger games series; twelve to fourty-eight players attempt to survive in a large arena and fight to the death until only one remains. LazleCraft has multiple different arenas to play in so you'll never get bored; it even has other minigames such as the spleef arena.

It was revealed during a post-earnings call. \"The Call of Duty franchise continues to set the bar for innovation and we expect the new Call of Duty game in development for 2013 to raise that bar even higher,\" Hirshberg said. \"There is increased volatility this year due to the ongoing console transition, which makes predicting the future more challenging than during normal years in the cycle. For Call of Duty, consistent with our past practices, we are planning for the mainline release in Q4 to be down versus 2012,\" Activision CFO Dennis Durkin added. Rumours say that the next game will be named Modern Warfare 4, which makes sense due to past releases. No developer has yet been named however. \n\n[color=white][b]Impossible Studios Shut Down[/b][/color]\nImpossible Studios has been shut down, just after the studio was formed in August 2012. Impossible Studios had former Big Huge Games developers and were working on the iOS game, Infinity Blade: Dungeons. The game is now on hold at this time (Yes, I am disappointed too). \"When former members of Big Huge Games approached Epic last year, we saw the opportunity to help a great group of people while putting them to work on a project that needed a team. It was a bold initiative and the Impossible folks made a gallant effort, but ultimately it wasn’t working out for Epic,\" company founder Tim Sweeney said in a statement. Sweeney said that \"affected staff will receive three months of severance pay and the opportunity to create a new company with the Impossible Studios logo.\"\n\n[color=white][b]New Assassins Creed Game[/b][/color]\nUbisoft announced that a new Assassins Creed game featuring a new hero will be released during the 2014 fiscal year. \"Fiscal year 2014 means any time between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014.\" Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot indicated the game will be developed by a new team and not Ubisoft Montreal. He also promised a major leap forward for the Assassins Creed franchise. The game will be developed by multiple studios, however nothing else has been announced. \n\n[color=white][b]Latest Xbox Achievements (New Games)[/b][/color]\n[url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/gears-of-war-judgment/achievements/]Gears of War: Judgment[/url] - 50 achievements, 1000 points. \n[url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/bioshock-infinite/achievements/]BioShock Infinite [/url]- 50 achievements, 1000 points. \n[url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-3/achievements/]Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3[/url] - 50 achievements, 1000 points.\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Game Releases (February)[/b][/color]\nAliens: Colonial Marines - February 12\nMUD: FIM Motocross World Championship - February 12\nOmerta: City of Gangsters - February 12\nCrysis 3 - February 19\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance - February 19\n\n[color=white][b]Video(s) of The Week[/b][/color]\nThe next Xbox and Playstation has been an extremely big topic lately with rumours flying around left, right and centre.

The potentially resource rich area has caused tension between China and Japan this week as the Japanese government accused a Chinese vessel of using radar on a Japanese Naval ship, which is usually used to aim weapons at enemies. The Japanese Prime Minister stated, \"The incident is a dangerous conduct that could have led to an unforeseeable situation. It is extremely regrettable that China carried out such a one-sided, provocative act when signs are emerging for dialogue.\" The Chinese Foreign Ministry retorted by saying, \"In recent days, Japan has on many occasions deployed aircraft and ships and illegally entered Chinese waters around the Diaoyu Islands. China has made representations on many occasions and requested Japan stop its illegal activities.\"\n\n[color=white][b]British Prime Minister Wants UK to Remain Whole[/b][/color]\nOn Sunday, British Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that Scotland could operate independently, but it urged Scottish citizens to remain as one with the United Kingdom. This is in light of the expected referendum for Scotland to become an independent nation that will be voted on next year. Britain's PM was quoted as saying, \"This big question is for Scotland to decide. But the answer matters to all of our United Kingdom. Scotland is better off in Britain. We're all better off together and poorer apart.\" Though it is true that the UK as a whole would be economically better off, the prime minister also has his political life and legacy to look after which pushes him to keep Scotland and Britain united.\n\n[color=white][b]Gang Rape in South Africa[/b][/color]\nIn Bredasdorp, South Africa, 17 year old Anene Booyson was raped and subsequently mutilated by a gang of men. As disheartening as this news is, what is even more disheartening is that it is all too common in South Africa, a place where 71% of women report that they've experienced sexual abuse. A resident in the area, Sophia Europa, proclaimed, \"I don't know what we must do, but we must do something...otherwise, there is no use giving birth to a baby boy if men treat women lower than animals.\" Though rape is a common occurrence in South Africa, this incident is unique in that it has caused such an uproar in the local community that it has now garnered national attention.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft's Surface Pro tablets went on sales last week. It is available in both 64GB  and 128 GB. Both the 68GB and 128GB versions Pros went out of stock on Microsoft.com. They cost $900 and $1000 respectively. They include 'Touch Cover' (keyboard) and 'Type Cover' (more conventional keyboard) which adds another $120 and $130. The company shipped about 1.25 million units for sale. Microsoft's officially posted in its blog, \" Surface Windows 8 Pro 64GB is available online or from store shelves at all Microsoft retail stores in the U.S. and Canada, at Staples and Best Buy in the United States, and from Best Buy and Future Shop in Canada.... We're working with our retail partners who are currently out of stock of the 128GB Surface Pro to replenish supplies as quickly as possible.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nEvasi0n, the latest jailbreak for the iOS was released this week and it has been found to be the fastest jailbreak to be adopted to. Evasi0n includes jailbreak for all iOS devices including the latest iPhone 5 which was considered to be the tough one to jailbreak by Apple. Apple sold 500 million units earlier in which more than 300 million units are iOS 6. Reports says that after the release of Evasi0n, around seven million users of iOS 6 have downloaded it. It is expected that Apple will fix the exploit used in Evasi0n, but the beta of iOS 6.1.1 that was released just after the release of Evasi0n wasn't the one to resolve the issue.\n\n[b][color=white]YouTube[/color][/b]\nEgypt has announced the suspension of YouTube for a month as a result of the film 'Innocence of Muslims'. This 13 minute film was uploaded on YouTube on July, 2012. This was a trailor of an upcoming movie in the U.S. This movie showed prophet Muhammad as a buffoon. The company didn't remove the video even after realizing that this film was deemed illegal in few countries. YouTube said, \"We work hard to create a community everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different opinions. This can be a challenge because what's OK in one country can be offensive elsewhere. This video -- which is widely available on the Web -- is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, we've restricted access to it in countries where it is illegal, such as India and Indonesia, as well as in Libya and Egypt given the very sensitive situations in these two countries. This approach is entirely consistent with principles we first laid out in 2007.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbjo5C8ZAaCfSc.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Monstercat Releases 'Best of 2012' EDM Compliation[/b][/color]\nThe YouTube music network 'Monstercat Media' have released their Best of 2012 music mix. In just five days, the 45 minute mix has accumulated 100,000 views along with over 6,000 video likes. The rapidly expanding channel has seen a huge influx in new fans (or family members as they are referred to within the community) over the course of 2012, causing an immense total of over 10,000 votes to be cast by viewers which were the sole influence for which songs were selected to be included. By the end of the voting period, 30 tracks were ready to be mixed by the masterful talent of Going Quantum, a co-founder and keen young DJ/Producer at the channel. Included were songs such as Noisestorm's \"Timewarp\", Ephixa’s \"Awesome to the Max\" and Varien’s \"Morphine\". The only condition was that each artist could only have one of their songs used in the mix to avoid a few of the most popular producers among the team getting 5+ videos entered. The release can be found [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycMg5Q6AtWI]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Katy Perry Sees Ghost While Recording Advert[/b][/color]\nAmerican singer Katy Perry was said to have run from a room, screaming, in the Beverly Hills mansion after spotting a ghost. She was alone in the master bedroom when she was reportedly heard 'screaming' from the staff at the location. Someone from the team said: \"Shivering and terrified, Katy told producers that whole she was alone in the master suite, she turned to the mirror - and froze when she saw a man sporting a moustache staring back at her, his face contorted in agony.\" Katy came running down the central staircase in the mansion and needed to be calmed down by everybody at the scene. After the incident, security quickly entered the room where she said the ghost was located, although to her surprise, they were unable to find any traces of a 'ghost'. Katy then left the house and said she would not return back. She was in the process of filming a new advert for her perfume brand, however, due to the demanding nature of a relocation of the set resulted in an attempt by director to persuade the star to stay. She eventually agreed under the agreement that all mirrors would be covered up and she would be with guards throughout filming.\n\n[color=white][b]Wild Belle announces UK Tour[/b][/color]\nThe rising Indie rock band, Wild Belle, notorious for being formed by two siblings, have announced a UK Tour in order to support the release of their first album. Their debut album, Isles, is expected to be released by Columbia Records on March 12, 2013. Until this, they have published three of the tracks to be included in the album: \"Keep You\", \"Backslider\" and \"It's Too Late\". It was recorded with the expert in electronics and producer Bill Skibbe at the Keyclub Recordings in Benton Harbor, Michigan. The to-be-released album is made up of eleven songs that appear to be a mixture of parts of several genres including retro pop, jazz, reggae and R&B.\n\n[color=white][b]Music video of the week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dX0r0A3jw8[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]User suggested music video[/color][/b]\n[spoiler=][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzinA__VAmE[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nWell, Tibit has stepped down as Headlines writer.

Would you go?\"\n\n[i]\"Would I like to go to the HF convention? Of course I would! Granted, it'd be \nin 2014, then I'd be 18 so I can still go into casinos, but not gamble haha. It'd \nbe really cool to meet some members in real life, see who they are outside of \nthe forums, see if those with the \"massive\" e-penises are actually who they \nclaim to be, and also to just chill with members who share the same interests! I \nwas also thinking, as a creative way, it'd be cool if each member got their own \nembossed name tag, and it had their username, then underneath it their profile \nURL. Also, to have a convention split up into each sub forums of the site, so they \ncould easily meet more people with the same interest.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1299713][i]-Chlamydia[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Totally i would go, I would love to meet all the members.
