Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News! Any shout outs before we begin?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: Professional Thanks for havin me Shout out to the riptide boys Shout out to clickque for finally getting around to this Shout out to mael That's about it let's get this show on the road\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: Tell us about yourself. What makes you, you?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: Not a lot to say about me. I'm just scraping by figuring shit out. These days just focusing on making music. I like to just keep my head down and stick with what I know staying out of drama and shit.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: What brought you into HF back when you first joined?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: Back when I was a lil 16 yr old I was a shithead that liked breaking blocks in a children's video game so I have here for big hacks Lost interest in that super quick like anyone else who has half a brain but stuck around for some reason\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: What do you do around here nowadays? How's your music production going?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: These days I just chill in groups and talk shit with the boys in there Only thing keeping me here right now is the groups I'm in Specifically riptide they the fam Production is going good. Only started recently and I'm loving it. I find it crazy therapeutic. One of the few things I sill enjoy.  Its good to be able to create something. Wanting to branch out and do vocals but I'll sound like shit lmao Maybe I'll make a vocal appearance on an upcoming riptide project for thrills\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: Think you'll ever end up doing music full time instead of a 9-5 job?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: Nah extremely unlikely. For production at least. I'm a firm believer that the whole 'turn your hobby into your job' saying is a load of shit. If I started doing music as a job it would just turn into work and I'd grow to not like it. Work is work. Its something I want to keep as a hobby and do it because I want to. Start adding money and business to music and you start to lose artistic integrity imo. Music is a way to express myself. not feed myself.  Only way I could see myself doing music production as a job is if it was just me and a group of friends having fun putting stuff out and doing some shows. Just like how some of the big underground artists are doing it.\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: Do you like where HF is going?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: I'm not even sure if I know where it's going.  I definitely don't find it as fun as I used to but I think that's just because everyone has grown up and we are not kids anymore. Most of my friends are closed or just disappeared.  I think a new generation is starting and they are probably going to enjoy the place just as much as whe did back in the day.   What I don't like however is where group are going.. Seems like people are doing all they can to milk every last drop of cash out of them. Selling sectors, subforums, renting the groups and even fuckn selling leadership. I'm not sure why someone would pay $500 to lead a group they are not affiliated with but whatever.  I'm just straight up sounding like and old man now lmao\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: People pay money for the spotlight, it's true. What are you doing for Halloween?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: It's a little sad really(but not heartthrob thank u for adding me to enigma bb).  Halloween probably going to be quiet. Think my friend is gonn have something at her place so I might go to that. Her and her boyfriend constantly fucked on xans & Valium so idk if they will end up hosting it lmao Might just go out and drink with a few mates if that falls through  I've never been huge on Halloween. Good as an excuse to see cute girls wear much less than they should tho lmao\n\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148788][color=#f033ec][b]Clique[/b][/color][/url]: That about wraps up our interview. Any final words?\n[url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1314004][color=#ffffff][b]mael[/b][/color][/url]: and that concludes what is probably the worst interview the news will ever see\n\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n \n[hr]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color][/size][/font]",

Thanks to low oxygen levels deep beneath the ocean, the ships have remained in relatively excellent condition. Some of the ships date back over 1000 years to the Byzantine Empire, while others date back to the ottoman empire. The archeologists were attempting to understand how the water level rose after the last Ice Age which took place 20,000 years ago, so they say finding the ships was a “complete bonus.”[i][size=x-small][url=http://qz.com/816936/maritime-archaeologists-accidentally-discovered-40-ancient-shipwrecks-at-the-bottom-of-the-black-sea/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]The Congress of Venezuela Declares President Maduro has Staged a Coup[/color][/b]\nVenezuela’s Congress declared that President Nicolas Maduro had staged a coup by blocking an effort to mandate his return to a legislative session. The original legislative session was an attempt to remove President Maduro from power, but it was interrupted by his supporters. Signatures were required by the opposition to hold another referendum to remove the president, but a court friendly to Maduro suspended their collecting of signatures. The majority of the opposition-led congress voted the court’s decision constituted a coup with government participation. Polls show that as much as 80% of the Venezuelan population wants Maduro replaced.[i][size=x-small][url=http://time.com/4542075/venezuela-congress-president-maduro-coup/?xid=IFT-Section] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]China Wants to Score its Citizens[/color][/b]\nThe Communist Party of China has a new plan to reward and punish its citizens. Using online data, they want to encourage good behavior among their citizens by scoring them. The score determines the “trustworthiness” of a person, and dictates much of what the citizen can do and where they can go. If the person's score is low, they could lose basic freedoms like travel or loans. If the person’s score is higher, then they may be able to get into the best schools or travel abroad. China aims to have a “harmonious socialist society” by 2020 with the implementation of this social credit system.

The standalone short-form video mobile app will be discontinued “in coming months,” the company said. Users will be able to download all the videos they created, and the Vine website will stay online, but the mobile app used to make Vines will be discontinued. According to multiple sources, significant layoffs hit Vine Thursday, though Twitter declined to specify how many at Vine were affected or whether any employees were being offered new jobs. The announcement was devoid of any explanations about what led to the decision, only stating that Twitter would share more news on its blog and via its official Twitter account in the future regarding what comes next.\n\n[color=white][url=http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/28/vine-founder-says-dont-sell-your-company-after-twitter-axes-service-as-pornhub-offers-to-buy-it.html][b]Could Pornhub Be the Savior of Vine?[/b][/url][/color]\nVine has been left to shrivel up and die on itself, but could we be in the wake of an unlikely savior? Earlier on Thursday Twitter announced it was ending Vine's short run, and the adult site Pornhub was quick to come to the rescue — maybe. The company has sent an official letter to Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and in turn Vine, offering to buy the company. In doing so it hopes to help avoid it being shut down entirely, as Twitter and Vine have announced it will do. The company does make clear that the site would turn into a porn site. The letter sent to Mr Dorsey by Pornhub CEO Corey Price says that Vine would be restored “back to its NSFW glory”.\n\n[color=white][url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-broadband-consumer-privacy-rules][b]FCC Adopts Broadband Consumer Privacy Policies[/b][/url][/color]\n\"It's the consumers' information. How it is used should be the consumers' choice\",  said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler as the commission adopted broad new privacy rules on Thursday that prevent companies like AT&T and Comcast from collecting and giving out digital information about individuals — such as the websites they visited and the apps they used. By a 3-to-2 vote, the Federal Communications Commission clearly took the side of consumers. The new rules require broadband providers to obtain permission from subscribers to gather and give out data on their web browsing, app use, location and financial information. Currently, broadband providers can track users unless those individuals tell them to stop.\n[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v3/GamingNews.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Final Fantasy 15 DLC Includes Online Co-Op[/color][/b]\nFinal Fantasy XV will offer online multiplayer after its November 29 launch! Square Enix recently announced that news along with some more information as part of its Paris Games Week event. There aren't many details regarding how online play will work, but it seems like the mode will only be available if you purchase Final Fantasy XV's DLC pass, which costs $25. Square also revealed that there will be several expansions that revolve around Gladiolus, Ignis, and Prompto. \"The main focus of the season pass is three original episodes that take place during the events of Final Fantasy XV,\" Square Enix said in a press release. \"Each episode allows players to take control of one of Noctis' comrades in all-new adventures that offer unique play styles tailored to each character. Players can explore previously unseen areas filled with new monsters, and even obtain weapons that can later be used in the main game.\" Episode Gladiolus comes out first, followed by Episode Ignis and then Episode Prompto. The aforementioned characters, who fight with Noctis in the main campaign, are the characters that will become playable in online co-op mode. This means that up to four players will be able to take part in the fun!

The video was aptly titled \"Immortal\" and showcases a player killing the infamous character, Jake Baker. The only problem being that he doesn't seem to actually die. Jack collapses to the floor, seemingly defeated, after the player unloads multiple rounds into his chest. To the player's demise, that doesn't seem to be enough to keep Jack down for good.  \"Oh, no, no, no. Now you're going to get it, boy,\" he says as he gets to his feet, just before the video cuts out. \"Something's not quite right with Jack,\" the video's description reads. Take a look at the trailer [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=50&v=HrsFgTtoGjU]here[/url]. This is episode six of Capcom's ongoing Resident Evil 7 gameplay teaser series. The first two in the Volume series came out earlier this month; one teased that a character from past games may return, while the other showed off a shotgun. Two videos were also released last week and within the videos you learn some survival tips with your knife and how to use herbs to heal yourself. Resident Evil 7 is set to release for PS4, Xbox One, and PC on January 24, 2017.

The FBI has obtained yet another warrant that made it possible for agents to search for emails that link directly to the private server that Clinton was utilizing. Instead of focusing on Clinton’s personal computers, the FBI has now taken aim at Anthony Weiner’s personal computers. Weiner, an ex-congressman, is thought to have dozens of emails. At this point, the content of the emails remains unknown. Before these newfound emails coming to light, Weiner was already in trouble with the law when the FBI had obtained a prior warrant to collect evidence linking to communications with a girl who was found to be underage. To date, the FBI is actively investigating the emails as mentioned above to see whether or not the content of the messages is grounds for further investigation. \r\n\r\n[b][url=http://www.nh1.com/news/4-reports-of-clowns-in-goffstown-teen-says-clown-scared-her-with-shovel-and-tripped-her/][color=#FFFFFF]Clowns on the Loose[/color][/url]\r\n[/b]As Halloween crept closer, the number of suspicion sightings of clowns increased. All over the nation, there have been individuals who have been dressing up as clowns for the sole purpose to scare the daylights out of normal, law abiding citizens. While most of those participating are just doing it for the thrill, others have taken advantage of the situation to play out real life fantasies. It was reported earlier that \"A group of four clowns allegedly took to the intersection at Elm Street and Maple Avenue - about a tenth of a mile away - as a part of an entertainment stunt to scare pedestrians roaming about, police say.” This has been causing panic around the nation. Parents have been informed to call law enforcement if they witness the sighting of a clown that is out and about late at night. Even more, some eye witnesses have noted that they have spotted clowns in the driveways of homes, in backyards, and related areas in the early hours of the morning. \r\n\r\n[b][url=http://www.businessinsider.com/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-drinking-water-2016-10][color=#FFFFFF]North Dakota Pipeline[/color][/url]\r\n[/b]In Cannon Ball, North Dakota, there are thousands upon thousands of protestors who are protesting the development of an access pipeline. The proposed pipeline is an \"1,172-mile oil project that would shuttle half a million barrels of North Dakota-produced oil to refining markets in Illinois.” There are scores of protestors at the site where the proposed pipeline would be positioned because the site is not only sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux, but it is also where a majority of the drinking water comes from for the local community. Protestors are worried that if the pipeline succeeds, a similar situation to that of Flint will take place or even worse. Native American tribes, local representatives, and even celebrities have joined the protest to fight against the proposed pipeline. As of late, some bystanders of the ongoing protests have been arrested, shot with rubber bullets, or held by local law enforcement officials.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v3/Comics/Wires.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center]\r\n[b][size=x-large]|1|[/size][/b][sp=]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/VshWo8V.png[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]|2|[/size][/b][sp=]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/RDF3PJD.png[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]|3|[/size][/b][sp=]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/mENm5tS.png[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]|4|[/size][/b][sp=]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/VOWSB1M.png[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]|5|[/size][/b][sp=]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/zApUYiy.png[/img][/sp][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v3/Credits.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][sp=View Team][align=left]\r\n\r\n[list][*][color=white][b][u]Scholars[/u][/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2504443]neeuQ[/url][/list][/list]\r\n\r\n[list][*][color=white][b][u]Journalists[/u][/b][/color]\r\n[list][*]Headlines\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=XXXXXX]OPEN[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]User News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019]illuminati▲[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Notable Threads\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=XXXXXX]OPEN[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Interviewers\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473].Sinister[/url][color=#98FB98]*[/color], [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878]Clique[/url], [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1957866]Enterpriser[/url], [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245]zSerity[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Group News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=XXXXXX]OPEN[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Site News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2577525]Hash G.[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Hacking News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1422600]Fox™[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Gaming News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2364291]Buffy Summers[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Tech News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1356937]Angеl[/url] & [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1730460]Gladly[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]World News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2110841]Night Fury[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Science News\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=662802]ryand8[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Spotlight\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239]iHydra[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Trends\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=XXXXXX]OPEN[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Comics\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=610356]Wires[/url] & [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1999047]Vitani[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]On-Call Team\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=610356]Wires[/url][color=#98FB98]*[/color], [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1999047]Vitani[/url], [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=3176965]Soulmatе[/url], [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1012051]Vossen[/url][/list][/list][/list]\r\n\r\n[list][*][color=white][b][u]Support[/u][/b][/color]\r\n[list][*]Edition Mover\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992020]King of Hearts[/url][/list][/list]\r\n[list][*]Graphics\r\n[list][*][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172]Novica[/url][/list][/list][/list]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFFFF][i]*Those with an asterisk are supervisors of that team.[/i][/color]\r\n\r\n[/align][/sp][/align]\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color][/size][/font]",
