As [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] had a lot of things going on, it's only a guess he had a lot of tabs open. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] was intending to delete three accounts with zero posts that were associated with a free email service. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] claims his cookies were never cleared, and after hitting delete it displayed \"21 members deleted\", when the intention was to delete three. Currently those members are marked as \"Unregistered Members\" in threads and posts. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] apologized and said he will do everything he can to recover those who were deleted, and for those effected, you will also need to work with [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] to recover your account. For the full thread posted by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] himself, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3482910][b]click here[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Official Marketers Group Deleted and Repfucked[/b][/color]\nOfficial group Marketers was recently deleted this week after [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] discovered a bum.ping service in their private sub-forum. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] later moved the service thread to Rules, Announcements, News and Feedback so others could see and understand his actions; [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3186805][b]click here[/b][/url] to view that thread. They were offering a bum.p for bum.p service for marketplace threads. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] considered this a gross violation of the site policy and decided to take action, so he repfucked all and closed some accounts of members who have been involved. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] said \"If you think my site policies are a joke then I advise you seek another site that doesn't give a fuck. I give a fuck about my rules and I don't care WHO is involed and no matter how much you donated or contributed...you still gotta follow site policies.\" [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also said \"This is such a slap in the face that I'm gonna slap back so fucking hard that you'll feel it 2015.\" Lesson learned.

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] claims Hack Forums will always come back online no matter what, and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also said, \"Since I've stopped most of the attack with only minor disruptions the attacker(s) has decided to enlarge the scope of the attack.\" [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] claims he plans on enhancing Hack Forums' DDoS protection, and hopefully be serving through three HTTP servers and at least two DDoS protection services. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] apologizes for the downtime.\n\n[color=white][b]Don't Forget to Follow Hack Forums on Twitter[/b][/color]\nThis isn't exactly site news but I thought I'd add a little section in giving the official twitter some publicity. Feel free to follow [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] on twitter here: https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet\nThere are a lot of updates on there that are not worth including into editions, but still informational.\n\n[b][color=white]Changes To The Reputation System[/color][/b]\nThe first massive change to the reputation system in HackForums history has finally been implemented. Reputation bum.ping is no longer possible, the reputation date will not change, and the reputation will not be moved to the top. Reputation is also not removable anymore, you only have the option to either change a reputation, or change the reputation value, such as negative, neutral, or positive. This will remove all the harassment and members who rep expecting to get a rep back from the community.

How are you doing today? Any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] Doing just fine, I'd like to say thanks to whoever helped and trusted me on HF and especially in the market place. 🙂\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] On HF, being an active and trusted member in the marketplace can be quite hard when you aren't upgraded, so I have to give you props on that. I see you joined back in February 2012. What led you to join HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] The member BitchGotRaped, it was back in 2012, when I was a game addict and wanted to learn how ddos and some other things worked, so he didn't have the time to explain everything so he linked me to hackforums and wanted me to learn it myself. Thankfully I learned everything I wanted and even a major coding languages such as python and a little vb.net.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I take it you don't play games anymore, right? You're the Marketplace kind of guy. What exactly do you do in the HF Marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] Yeh, I used to play dota for like 16 hours/day, I suddenly decided to get a life, learned how to market without buying any ebooks on HF ,at first I cioded a small program which checks for OG stuff and automatically creates them, it was my first step in marketing on HF, and as time passed I have went through PPD/CPA for sometime and still going on with it till now. Been earning some good income as I knew how to do it correctly and have the traffic I needed .I currently mostly do e-currency exchanges on HF, as my country does not support paypal and am really in need of exchanging atleast 400-500$ everyday .Im working on a new business at the moment as I want to abandon CPA due to it taking alot of time and is not so fun although its one of the easiest things to do on the web. 🙂\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Why are you not upgraded on HF? Is it just to keep the prestige?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest its not about keeping prestige, but buying fame is not how things work. So far I have about 30-40 members who wanted and some of them already paid for my upgrade but I never got it as I messaged omni and told him to never upgrade me. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] That's stunning. 30+ members tried to upgrade you :hehe. Did they get their money back or did Omni keep it 😝? On another note, what do you think of the Marketplace currently?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] Im really not sure what happens but most of them after they know that im never going to get upgraded they send me a sad face or just rage :tounge:, I won't say that they all paid for it, but im sure some of them did and especially 3 marketers from the thread I made about them (Including the member Riggs). Currently the marketplace on HF is not that bad although it needs some minor adjustments, adding something like the vouch system and taking actions with scammers with several valid scam reports would make the marketplace just perfect \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] About the Marketers' group deletion.. do you have anything to say? I know you're one of the first members to bring opposition to the buy-ins.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] Not really, after I experienced such group I expected that Marketers won't stay long with a such a leader and such low quality members in it. I personally bought in it just to boost up my market place reputation as I had some businesses on HF back in the time, and was really in need for some trust. It was a really stupid move because I thought it would at least help a little by asking \"marketers\" about businesses, no one had any experience most of them are immature and money hungers, and Codevade is an example.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Did you leave before the thread ing topic was made (the one that caused the deletion of the group)? I think you left before Codevade decided to kick all the pay-in members; why did you decide to leave?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] As far as I know, I wasn't in the group when the thread ing service thread was made. I didn't leave nor Codevade did kick me, I got banned for a week due to violation a rule on HF by mistake, and when someone gets banned he/she automatically gets kicked from all groups, I pmed Codevade to let me back in but he ignored me, I stayed patient for 1-2 weeks, and still nothing, decided to leave some feedback about the group, because I don't think the rule \"Once you are banned from HF, you can't join back in \" even if it was a vacation ban . So yeh I made this small thread and paid for a sticky for it, and was expecting so much hate from it, but who cares, expressing an opinion comes before anything.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I have to agree. What you did was right and I respect you for it. Any final words to conclude this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182524][color=white][b]CoBrAxXx:[/b][/color][/url] I would really like to thank HF for changing my life socially/virtually, I used to spend alot of time at home not doing anything except wasting my time on a game that never had a meaning,  after so many threads weather inspirational or not about personal lifes/education/sports, I've really changed socially in terms of Language/Health/Personal​ity/Lifestyle.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] That's fantastic! Thanks for taking part in this interview, CoBrA.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Hello HF News readers! For today's edition, we will be interviewing the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]! To start us off, do you have any shoutouts you would like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] I have only one, surprisingly. I'd like to give a shoutout to the lovely Sarah/Fl0werpot. We've been friends for quite sometime and I'm glad I got to meet her.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure she'll be extremely glad to hear the shoutout! Now, I'm sure we'd all like to know the following: why you did you join Hack Forums in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I love to write so we'll see how short I can make this for the readers enjoyment. One day, back in 2007, I was playing Call of Duty 4. I met a guy from a mutual friend and we just clicked. We played everyday no matter what. If we were in a party with someone, we would leave and just have us. Eventually, I met his brother, John. He was the coolest guy ever. We started chatting on XBox, too and eventually he told me about Host Booting. (I was playing Halo 3 with him once and asked how he got a 50.) He eventually told me he signed up on Hack Forums and this is how I got here. My main goal at first was Host Booting and Ratting.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I can safely say that I'm glad he did tell you to sign up here, and I'm sure you are too! Now, recently, I'm sure you've been aware that two of the staff members have been demoted: Hexicidal and Genuine. What do you think of this? Do you have any theories as to why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I don't have any comments on it at the moment. Genuine was a great staff member, I'll tell you that. I usually went to him if I wanted to report something. He really was my go-to guy for anything site related. Hex is a great guy, I'll tell you that. Once he got promoted too, I would PM him as well. He was always active, and when I say that I mean always. I always saw his username in green and wished that was me. Anyways, I respect their decision. If they both decided to step-down, well, that's their choice. Not everyone can sign on everyday and work for the forum. Everyone has a family and even things to do themselves that are more important. My current theory would be that Omni was looking for new staff, and the two were willing to be demoted.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I'm sure it's extremely demanding to be a staff member on Hack Forums; logging on every day multiple times and checking the reports must be extremely difficult and tiring. The next topic I'd like to ask you about is the new reputation system. What do you think about the fact that you can no longer customise your reputation reason, but instead can choose from a drop down list of options?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I don't like that at all. Hack Forums is already a unique forum with Prestige, Upcoming Vouch System, Rep F*cks, so on so forth. Reputation is unique, too, because it allows users to state their own unique opinions. Like I keep saying \"Unique\". Some of the things Omni sayed would be allowed does not exactly suffice for me. I believe that we should be able to state our own opinions. I don't see why we can't have another JD on the forum. Judge Dredd was an excellent admin, let me tell you that, but I don't see why he can't find a replacement. I respect Omni for what he's doing (Trust wise) but I'm sure there's one Staff Member that could have been promoted.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I also feel as though Judge Dredd did a nice job around the forum and I agree it's a shame he was demoted. I too am not sure about the new reputation system, I prefer the current system, but I'm sure it's going to be for the best. Now recently Omni deleted the Marketers group for their \"ing threads\" service they had within the subforum. What do you think of his decision? Could there have been another way to solve the problem?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] I never was associated with the group. The only good buddy from there would be Nickelodeon. Anyways, I didn't even understand what was going on at first. I think Omni \"brought the rain\" but he could have simply just dealt with the members involved instead of deleting the whole group. As for another solution? Well, there's no going back, that's all I can say.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I did feel it was a little harsh on Codevade considering he's now around $2,500 down the drain, or however much he bought the group for. Anyway, now for a shift of topics. Recently, you were appointed as the HF Music News writer. How has this position suited you? Are you enjoying it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I love it; I've always been a fan of writing, and well, here I am. I've always wanted to be apart of the Writers. Whether it be the Wiki team or the News team, I wanted to join. Lucky enough, I got accepted for the Wiki Team and bam, a few weeks later I took your spot for Music News. I'm hoping you're enjoying your new position? Sorry about that, haha. There's only one problem: not too many people like what I write. I'd love if people could tell me what they're more interested in. Yes, I write about Justin Bieber, but if it's not what they want, well I don't know what to write about.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I'm glad to hear you love it! And well, I'd been writing the music news for some time, around four months I believe, meaning I'd gotten a little bored of the role. I was glad to pounce on the news position and hand the music news over to you. How has the Wiki team been for you? I've found it quite difficult to keep up with the required activity, have you been able to output a reasonable number of Wiki articles lately?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Oh boy, I enjoy it a lot. I've learned a lot to be honest. I sometimes forget that I shouldn't write in Wiki Syntax when talking to friends. As for the articles, I believe I have a good amount for just being recently recruited. I have around 6+ and I'm working on 3 at the moment. ^_^\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. It seems to be that you really do love writing, haha. You're clearly talented with it too! You're clearly becoming an HF veteran; you have over 500 rep, 7,000 posts and you've been here for well over two years now. What's kept you coming back to the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Sadly, I'm a post wh*re. I sometimes post more than I should. What keeps me coming back is the HF groups. Once I joined my first group the \"Minecrafters\" way back when, I finally got to talk to new people and make friends. Groups are the sole purpose I'm still around.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Groups really do keep a lot of people coming back to the forums. I'd probably not still be here with the Writ3rs, I enjoy doing the HF News and I don't really do anything else other than that, I hardly post three times a week anymore too. I guess it's a shame but I don't really care for the site that much anymore. Are there any news groups which you would be interested in joining since for the moment you're only part of the Writ3rs and the Ub3r usergroup?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] News groups or do you mean other groups? ;p I'll answer both. I used to be on a news team for another site. It's not nearly as active as HF, but it has a small amount of active members. That's where I first started writing. If you meant to ask other groups I want to join, well at the moment, only three. Infamous, The Alliance, and Void. Infamous because the members are great. I've wanted to join for a small amount of time and I believe the SF has great content waiting for me to view and learn off of. I believe I can learn more than I already know by being in a small group with a lot of knowledge members. As for TA, well, I look up to the group. Para is a great leader and I love how the group has been around for so long. Also, when I heard there were different sectors I thought that was cool. I've never seen that before and when I was introduced to it in the recruitment thread I thought it was cool. Last, but not least, Void. Void is a group filled with the smartest users on the forum. This group has no trolls what-so-ever and they take things seriously. I love the debating that goes on outside the SF (since I can't view inside it) and I love how they're actively posting in the SRPP section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] That's cool. I wish you the best of luck with your ambitions with regards to the groups on Hack Forums! Before I end the interview for today's edition, I'd like to say thank you for taking part, and I am sure other members will be thankful too. Do you have any last words you would like to say?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=white][b]Anima Libera:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, just a few more words. First, I probably used an excessive amount of commas. It's kind of a habit. Second, thanks for allowing me to be interviewed. I do appreciate it. (:\n[/spoiler]",

Early this week Omniscient stated that he wanted to remove factions from HC in order to create a more peaceful, non-PVP oriented server. Although factions were never removed as whole, PVP was disabled and steps have been taken to turn the server in a more peaceful direction. Omniscient posted a list of goals for the server which include disabling server wide PVP, making factions peaceful, adding a PVP arena, providing free factions and adding a buy/sell shop with most items. An update was posted this week in which Omni announces that PVP was disabled in \"world\", meaning the End and Nether still have PVP enabled; this is, however, a big step in removing PVP from the server. It seems as if these changes are intended to focus the server on survival and building, essentially removing PVP as well as hostility between players. While many players support the recent changes, many are also opposed to the removal of PVP; some say the server is pointless without PVP and that the removal of it will only promote griefing.

Spleef League has an active community and is even home to spleefing teams; for those who are unaware, spleefing is an addictive arena minigame in which players attempt to break the ground under their opponents in order to make them fall into lava. The last person standing wins!

The event should lay many rumours to rest whilst sparking a lot of discussion about the console. However, Microsoft won't be showing their blockbuster lineup of games until the E3 Expo. You can watch the Xbox Reveal via Xbox LIVE and Xbox.com. Spike TV is also broadcasting the event for viewers in US and Canada. If you can't view those streams, IGN and Gamespot will be broadcasting the event on their website, whilst tweeting throughout the event. The event starts at 1p ET/10a PT/17:00 GMT in the US and 3am on May 22nd in Australia (AEST). If for some reason you miss all the coverage, there will be a discussion thread on HF created by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=138559]MarkMare[/url] closer to the event and a recap will be in next week's HF News. Major Nelson posted an image on his blog showing a preview of the special structure on the Xbox campus. You can view that image [url=http://media.whosay.com/340478/340478_lalt.jpg]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]New GTA 5 Screenshots[/b][/color]\nRockstar Games has released four new screenshots from upcoming game Grand Theft Auto 5. The screens show the game's protagonists escaping from the police, both on land and in the ocean. GTA 5 launches on September 17th for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. No word yet on next-generation release dates.

However, I've added some extra sections below that you may like. Throughout the next few editions, I'll be experimenting with sections to make Gaming News more \"community\" focused and provide more relevant news and information. There may be a small facelift to the lists below and you may see some notable gaming threads in the next edition. I would like your feedback on what you want to see in the Gaming News. It can only improve with your feedback, so don't be scared to submit ideas to me.\n\n[color=white][b]Recently Released[/b][/color]\nMetro: Last Light\nSanctum 2\nDUST 514\n\n[color=white][b]Latest Game Reviews[/b][/color]\nMetro: Last Light - [url=http://au.gamespot.com/metro-last-light/reviews/metro-last-light-review-6408419/]GameSpot[/url], [url=http://www.oxmonline.com/metro-last-light-review]OXM Online[/url]\nSanctum 2 - [url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sanctum_2/b/xbox360/archive/2013/05/16/sanctum-2-review-.aspx]Game Informer[/url], [url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/05/15/sanctum-2-review]IGN[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Games[/b][/color]\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Fast & Furious: Showdown\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Resident Evil: Revelations\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - Fuse\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - GRID 2\n[b]Jun 04, 2013[/b] - Painkiller: Hell & Damnation\n[b]Jun 04, 2013[/b] - Remember Me\n[b]Jun 11, 2013[/b] - Dark\n[b]Jun 25, 2013[/b] - Deadpool\n[b]Jun 25, 2013[/b] - Ride to Hell: Retribution\n\n[color=white][b]Games to Try:[/b][/color]\nDoritos Crash Course 2 was recently released on Xbox LIVE and it may have been released on W8.

It also has 400 gamerscores for the achievement hunters out there. Metro: Last Light is a new game with mixed reviews. It's a full game and it's worth getting out if you liked the last Metro game.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/WUfG6PO.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Nigel Farage Rants at “fascist” Protesters after Edinburgh Demonstration[/b][/color]\nThe leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, described protesters at the Edinburgh demonstration as “fascist scum”. After the confrontations became more heated, Mr. Farage had to be escorted from the Ganons’ Gait pub in a police van. Mr. Farage said the incident was deeply racist and was a portrayal of total hatred of the English.\n\n[color=white][b]Yahoo is “to buy Tumblr for $1.1bn”[/b][/color]\nYahoo’s board has approved to buy the New York-based blogging service known as Tumblr for $1.1 billion dollars according to US media reports. According to the new terms, Tumblr will remain generally the same as it is now. Analysts say that by acquiring Tumblr, Yahoo will gain a larger social media presence and attract younger audiences as the rivalry between Google and Facebook battles on.\n\n[color=white][b]Syrian Army Storms the Rebel Town of Qusair[/b][/color]\nThere has been heavy fighting reported in the now besieged Syrian town of Qusair after Syrian state forces launched a major offensive to re-capture the rebel stronghold. Rebels say that 50 people have been killed while the state media says 70 terrorists are dead. The UN said last week that the death toll in Syria has reached at least 80,000.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/HC03XDa.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Google I/O[/b][/color]\nGoogle's annual developer conference, Google I/O, was held over this weekend. Unlike last year, there was no spectacular skydiving show, however, I do think Google released some awesome new services and made some great announcements! Here are some of the bigger things they are rolling out:\n[list]\n[*][b]Google Maps Redesign[/b] - The new Google Maps looks beautiful. They are saying that the map is the UI itself. No cluttler; just the data you're looking for. I must say, it looks awesome and I can't wait to use it! It should be out this summer, however you can get in on an early beta by applying [url=maps.google.com/preview]here[/url].\n[*][b]Google Hangouts App[/b] - So, Google \"Babble\" has been rumoured for a while. It was meant to unify all of Google's chatting services. Well, at Google I/O, the Hangouts app was announced. It really does bring together the best of Google; seamless photo integration as well as video chat. Available on all platforms!\n[*][b]Stock Galaxy S4[/b] - Samsung's flagship device, the Galaxy S4, will now be available for purchase directly from the Google Play Store. The device will be stock Android Jellybean 4.2.2 and will come completely carrier unlocked! The pricing starts at $649 - definitely a great option if you don't want a contract and/or aren't a fan of TouchWiz!\n[*][b]Google Play Music All Access[/b] - This is Google's answer to Spotify and other such music streaming services. The web app, which will also be available for smartphones will allow you to integrate your current music library with music you can get streamed. And everything is stored on the cloud, so you can access your tunes anywhere! The service will be rolled out starting in the US for $9.99/month, or $7.99/month if you order early!\n[/list]\n\nThere was, surprisingly, no new information about Google Glass, Android 4.3/5.0 or even any new Nexus devices.\n\n[color=white][b]Cydia Substrate Now Available for Android![/b][/color]\nAndroid has always been a very open mobile OS, allowing heavy customization without needing to \"root\" your device (the Android equivalent of Jailbreaking). However, Cydia substrate now brings some features that previously may have required you to install a custom ROM on your device. Get downloading!\n\n[color=white][b]Yahoo! to Purchase Tumblr[/b][/color]\nRumours claim that Yahoo! have approved a bid to purchase the popular blogging site Tumblr for $1.1bn. Nothing is currently confirmed, however. Many users of Tumblr are against this, hoping that the site will not share the same fate as \"Geocities\" - purchased by Yahoo! and subsequently closed in 2009.\n\nWhat do you guys think about the potential Tumblr acquisition? And are you excited by what Google is bringing to the table with their new services?\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/8ExtO52.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Jay-Z Accused of Being a Time Traveler[/b][/color]\nRecently a photo from the 1930's in New York of a man who looked exactly like the rapper Jay-Z has surfaced. The photo had a huge resemblance of the famous rapper, and many people believed that he traveled in time. Jokingly, they asked Jay-Z if he was a vampire or a time traveler. Many people believe that since he has the money and the power that he can just get anything his heart desires. The picture, which was posted in various different places, shows a man in a cap staring directly into a camera. Possibly this man was famous just like Jay-Z, or possibly could have been an actor. The Schomburg Center blog posted the picture with the following:\n\"Does the man on the right remind you of someone? Perhaps it was his great-grandfather taking a break in Harlem in 1939. The photographer, we know for sure, was Sid Grossman. If you can put a (real) name on the young man, let us know.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Taylor Swift 'fan' Arrested for Trespassing[/b][/color]\nA Taylor Swift fan was arrested near the singer's house. A 22-year-old male was taken into custody for trespassing. Supposedly, he swam up to the beach right in front of her house. His only intention was to meet Taylor. TMZ stated, \"We spotted the man getting out of the ocean, around 1 mile from Swift's home\" This went on at around 2.20 am. Currently, at this very moment, the suspect from Chicago is still in custody at a nearby police station. The overzealous fan swam over 2 miles from where he first started swimming from. This most certainly isn't the first time Taylor has come across an obsessed fan. At the end of last year, 24-year-old Jacob Nicholas Kulke was arrested after climbing a fence and a secured gate at her home in Nashville, Tennessee. Taylor had a few things to say about the matter: \n\"I get nervous when I have stalker incidents. I try not to talk too much about it because it scares me. Sometimes you get a dude who kind of wants to steal you. That's why I'm so grateful I have people looking after me, like [my bodyguard] Dennis. Over the past couple of years it's got worse. I get told if there's been an attempt or a threat. My security text me a picture and say, 'Look out for this dude; he's driven across the country, he's off his meds,' or something like that. No one has ever been successful in getting into my house or anything like that. I have an amazing security team.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Justin Timberlake And Juicy J Recorded 'A Couple' Tracks[/b][/color]\nThe members of the rapping group Three 6 Mafia are one of the lucky few who have been able to record and sing with Justin Timberlake. The group had helped him out in his 2006 FutureSex/LoveSounds track \"Chop Me Up.\" Now, Juicy J has finally had his alone time with Justin and the two are now recording a few songs together. For all you fans out there following Juicy, you'll know that his upcoming album, Stay Trippy, is on its way. For all of you fans out there curious and have no information regarding his Stay Trippy album, it is currently scheduled for release on July 2. Soon after that, songs will be released for the public to preview. Juicy said, \"I've got this record [with Timberlake], but it's not all the way finished yet.\" (He's from Memphis like me so we have connections with people). We did a couple of records [together], but he's still gotta do the vocals, so hopefully, while they're doing the mixing, it'll make the album. Right now, we're wrapping it up and hopefully it'll definitely make the album because it's a great song.\"\nBoth artists believe that they're talented, and it seems that the two are having a lot of fun together.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/oZCrt03.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI hope you've enjoyed this rather stuffed edition!\n\nAs for an update on my condition, I am doing much better. I had hoped it wouldn't interfere with the HF News, but oh well. Shit happens sometimes.\nI don't know what I had, but it is almost gone now. Getting a full night's rest and gutting meds helped quite a bit. \nEnjoy!",

I've read into bit coins, and almost fully understand \nthe concept and how they're generated and such. I am hopeful \nsomebody who fully understands the concept of the cryptocurrencies \nsuch as bitcoins and litecoins makes a thread in the section explaining \neverything. I am aware Omniscient originally was skeptical about the \npracticality of the entire operations of crypto-currencies, but he is \nshowing consideration now that he created the award for donation 1 \nbitcoin, and the creation of this new section. So far, from reading \nthe section, I haven't seen any spammy type of posting of similar \ntypes threads, nor have I seen any other problem behaviors other \nsections might experience. Possible the cryptocurrency subforum \nwill be the first of a few more additions I feel will fit inside the \nmoney subforum.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][i]-Kray[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Crypto currency is always an area that I've not \nbeen 100% sure of. I've been interested, and sometimes wanted \nto really start trying to be more involved, but other times I feel \nlike things like it are open to collapse. Solid currencies such as \nthe USD are closely monitored and controlled by governmental \norganizations, whereas BitCoin and the likes are susceptible to \nbeing tapped into, laundering etc. It's just my personal opinion. \nAs for having a section for it in HF, it's okay, but I can't see \nmyself using it.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=823754][i]-McDork[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I think as Crypto Currencies are getting popular this was a \ngreat decision to add. As BTC starts to get accepted by more \nand more companies, the more popular it gets. I just think this \nneeded to happen, and I like how he dedicated a whole section \nto just Crypto currency in general. Now, Users can ask, learn, \nand answer all questions regarding any Crypto currency. Not \nonly is this a good short term decision, it also will be for long \nterm. Crypto currencies will continue to grow and be created \nlike offsprings of BTC. Anyways, Great edition to keep Hack \nForums growing and abounding in knowledge.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1498588][i]-WaterSpice[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"The Crypto Currency forum is a great addition \nto act as a catch-hole for all Bitcoin and Litecoin topics. There \nis not too much discussion to be had in the forum, as Crypto \nCurrency is exactly as it sounds: a currency. Apart from tutorials \nand questions, this forum will never be live with a plethora of \ndiscussions. However, it is nice to finally have a relevant forum \nfor this topic, and it is very fitting since we now have the new \nBitcoin donation award. The new forum will surely help clear out \nthe irrelevant crypto currency discussion in other subforums.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=7744][i]-Peter L[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"How do you feel about Omniscient's actions involving the 'Marketers'?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2ztBeuZ.png[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iqpIHn4aceyna.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/hv1hEkb.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.intothemangrove.com/comics/2013-05-20-itm_47_web.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://24.media.tumblr.com/c0d3f7498a4c93895ba2e03c5d794c1a/tumblr_mn2wrafghy1r9qk1io1_500.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.lifelooselybased.com/imgs/comics/188_content2.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://hugecartoons.com/comics/2013-05-20-Degree.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Dwj1rs0.png[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121196]Natha[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/Y2HFq]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528]Odin the Wanderer[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody‍[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854]CarrotMilk[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]BagHead[/url]\n[list][*]Minecraft News[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193]Connected[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679]SkyGuy[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editor[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426]+Awesome[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody‍[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021]Retribute[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
