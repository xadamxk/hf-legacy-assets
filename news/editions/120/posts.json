This member decided that he would giveaway $1100 to a member who he deemed fit. This member is known as [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=801804]iScythe++[/url] who just so happens is a part of the infamous group, InFaMoUs! Such a contest is unprecedented in the HF community and is quite the act of generosity on his part. For those who didn't catch the thread, it can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3059707]here[/url]!\r\n\n[b][color=white]The Cleansing, of Sorts[/color][/b]\r\nWith Codevade, the owner of the renowned group Marketers back in action following his release from prison, he has made it clear that changes will be occurring for the group. It all initially began with The Grim being added as a leader to the custom user group but has now reached new heights in which a total of 85 members were kicked from the group. Now, that initially isn't much to talk about. But the thing is, all those 85 members were members who paid to get in with a total of what is claimed to be $4250. This is quite a unique occurrence around here and it will surely be interesting how things pan out!\r\n\n[b][color=white]For You Frugal Folk...[/color][/b]\r\nIt appears that for the first time in quite a long time, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has decided to put a discount coupon on the HF L33T upgrade price! The deal was only a one day event which fell on Cyber Monday. This coupon led to one receiving $3 off their L33T purchase on that day which was surely a great thing for those Normal Members who are tight on cash.\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jHAVGLpCK2X3O.png[/img][/align]\r\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2103][b]Crow[/b][/url] reached 1,000 reputation points!

Any shoutouts or remarks you'd like to make before we go on?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: Absolutely. (no particular order) iNviZ, bugga, xadamxk, iRun, +Entity, AnthonyWash3r3, Style, Xch4ng3, malichi, Daisy, felicia & Wind.\r\nI'm sure there are members that I've missed.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: That's a lot of friends you have. How did you come to meet some of them?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: I met you when I first joined this forum in the iOS section. I got to know iNviZ when his name was n4z1 in Black Knights. He got mentor soon after. I remember that day. I met Daisy in Rhythm even though I never expected such a great time. Wind gave me my first negative reputation, and I thank him for that. If it aren't for him I would not have learn to pick up with this forum as quickly as I did. Malichi was in one of Wind's threads and I chatted it up with him. Became friends with him after a lot of debates. I met Adam in the iOS section after I was done giving everyone in the section a lot of shit. I remember Adam saying he knew Joshua Hill and I called him out for it. Apparently, he has pretty good connections. \r\nStyle was the one that introduced me here. 'Properly'. I know him in real life and he's a great close friend of mine. He's not really active anymore, but he checks HF every day. \r\nThat's about it. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You're one of the few people I've seen who have an IRL friend on the forum. How did you get involved in your various groups? You were a major figure within the Black Knights and Wraith when they were around.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: To be honest I should be blacklisted from all the groups back then. I sent a join request to every single one when I joined. \r\nI bought l33t the first day I joined the forums and later on I got bored. I wanted ub3r and asked Style how to acquire the status and he told me along the lines that only \"special\" people could get it. He wasn't in any groups do I didn't know about that till I was flipping through tabs. \r\nI finally found the group discussions and clicked on one. I spent half an hour on my Black Knights application. Although, my first group was the unofficial iDevice Lovers. I joined The Wraiths later on and Hawkins was one of the best if not THE best leaders I had. It was during the downfall of the Black Knights when we got to be friends. Thanks to Enterprice, I got into both Reverence, TechSperts, and Serenity. I have been in Propitious too. I played a major role in the Wraith after Hawk and I became friends. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You were one of the first people in Root (when it was active.) I'm surprised you haven't mentioned it. What happened within the group forum?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: I would spill, but it's strictly in the rules that I cannot mention how I got in or anything inside the sub forum. \r\nSorry to disappoint. I will say that the members in it are all extremely knowledgeable.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad to hear that those people in the group are deserving. Which group on HF means/meant the most to you?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: To me...\r\nWraiths. Nothing comes close to the family we had in the Wraiths. \r\nBlack Knights and Propitious hangs at the same level of importance. Partially because of iNviZ. He's the person that made things happen. A brilliant leader with intelligent ideas and successful ways to properly run a group. \r\nRoot is the current group I hold most dear.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How are the new leaders of Root? Without spoiling forum content, I mean to say. I know that Castle Bravo has been inactive, so what are Starfall & RyanC doing to help increase the public image of Root?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: Nothing much. However Starfall is an amazing leader. I got off with bad terms with her/him, but that was patched up when he/she realized I had knew what I was talking about. Castle Bravo is a really relaxed leader and I like that. Reminds me of Hawkins. Viral Dragon really did a lot for the group as well, but something happened and hell broke loose. \r\nRyanC? I don't know what he does. That's an honest and observant statement.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Sounds like things are picking up! Tell Starfall to respond to his/her PM's every once in a while. How did you learn about computers, technology and such that earned you a spot in Root?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: Starfall doesn't even respond to my PMs.\r\nMy knowledge came mostly from HackForums.\r\nAll my iDevice knowledge comes from third party sources. Mostly self taught and experience. \r\nI've looked up simple tutorials from place to place and ultimately compiled them into one for knowledge.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Have you written any tutorials on what you've learned?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: Not anything in particular. The reason behind this isn't because I'm unwilling to share, it's because I'm unwilling to waste my time. If I posted a tutorial (like the keylogger sets), or if I post some theming tutorial, or anything in general...it will get ignored. Even if they are good enough, then people don't bother reading the whole tutorial. The whole package goes with these tutorials. \r\n-Bad questions\r\n-Stupid questions\r\n-Stupid replies such as\r\n-Grammatically broken questions\r\n-Grammatically broken replies\r\n-Shit attitude\r\n-Repeated Questions/Posts (as if I don't go through the first one) \r\n-Ignore\r\n-Flames\r\n-Spam\r\n-Spam PM's\r\nI think we get the point.\r\nThat is why I refuse to post any thread for serious matters in any sense. It's a waste of my time, and I advise everyone on HF to seriously consider these factors before they post a tutorial.\r\nThe serious threads I post now, are automatically closed, because I dislike the responses I get 75% of the time. \r\nSo the 25% can just PM me. Then 20% of those PM's I ignore, cause they become the list I made up there in PM form.\r\nI reply to about 3%. Where'd the other 2% go? Probably the trash can. \r\nThis is my honest decision, and it wouldn't hurt to learn from experience.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Pretty big opinion. But it makes sense. Any closing comments to wrap things up?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][color=white][b]Grin[/b][/color][/url]: Fuck what people think. \r\nIt's been a pleasure talking to you. Kudos.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666]adampelletgun[/url][/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Hello, and welcome to the 200th edition of the HF News, adampelletgun. Would you like to give anyone a shoutout?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: Hey and thanks for the opportunity.\r\nI could write a whole list to be honest, but mainly I would like to thanks Omni for creating this community and to all the staff who help keep the place clean.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: You're welcome Adam, and congratulations on achieving Mentor. That's an incredible achievement. When you first joined HackForums, did you have plans on becoming Mentor, or did you just go with the flow?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: Thank you. When I first joined I never had any plans of upgrading or anything. I was just looking for things to learn.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: We're all here to learn something, what did you learn since you have been on HackForums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: I have learnt many things. The main skill I have developed is common-sense regarding computer security and many other areas.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: One of my favorite philosophical ideals is, if it is called common-sense, why is it so rare in today's world.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: Very true. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: What do you feel is something everyone should know about computers? From that idea, what is something that when you first began your journey on HackForums, what interested you about computer security?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: About how everything can be faked, And I mean everything! Always be on-guard when it comes to the internet. What interested me? I heard a lot about this \"Hacking\" mainly from the gaming scene and I wanted to understand what it meant.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: It seems the majority of the community has some sort of gaming background, it's amazing how times evolve. When you came from the gaming scene, what types of games interest you? Do you have a set group of friends you play with?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: The main games I played where games from the GTA/COD series. I used to, but I put more time into HF so my activity sloped gaming wise.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Those are some of the best games out there to be honest, what does your activity mostly compromise of now?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: My main online activities include moderating HF. I recently bought myself an iPad so I could moderate HF anywhere in the house. :) I enjoy playing older COD's as I obtain more joy from playing them rather than the new releases.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=#0066FF][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Keep up the good work man, you have so much further to go. Well, this is the end, our no good friends, the end. Would you like to say anything else to end our interview?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=white][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for the interview invitation and shout out to all the HF news team for all the good work they do.\r\n\n[/spoiler]",

The terrorists used suicide bombs and rockets to terrorize and cause destruction. The Taliban claimed to be responsible for the act via a spokesman. Nasir Ahmad Safi, a spokesman for the provincial government, stated that two of the suicide bombers had detonated the bombs in cars. Major Martyn Crighton, a spokesman for International Security Assistance Force said, \"There were multiple suicide bombers involved.\" Attacks such as these raises concerns for the planned 2014 NATO troop withdrawal.\n\n[b][color=white]Reworking of Russian Religious Law[/color][/b]\nThe Russian government may look to soften the law that can have \"religious offenders\" jailed. Two members of the Puss Riot band were handed two year prison terms for breaking this law. Critics of the law say it is too vaguely worded, and they also claim it is used as a way to suppress dissent. Alexei Malashenko stated, \"The impression is that in the Kremlin they understood that somehow they have overdone it.\" She goes on to say, \"The goal of this law is still to tighten regulations in general but they understand that a too radical tightening is dangerous so they will consult now and hold talks, especially as at the Kremlin itself there is no unanimity on that matter.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Palestine Recognized As State  [/color][/b]\nThe UN has shown immense support for Palestine as they have voted for giving Palestine recognized statehood. Over two-thirds of the voting body voted for Palestine to be recognized as a \"nonmember observer state.\" The voting consisted of 139 yays, 9 nays, and 41 abstentions. The U.S. and Israel, however, denounced the newly approved status for Palestine. The UN ambassador Susan Rice stated, \"Today's unfortunate and counterproductive resolution places further obstacles in the path of peace.\" She continued on by remarking, \"Today's grand pronouncements will soon fade and the Palestinian people will wake up tomorrow and find that little about their lives has changed save that the prospects of a durable peace have only receded.\" Along with that, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the vote was \"meaningless.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nApple has released its new iTunes 11 this past week. All iTunes can be upgraded to iTunes 11 without charge. Apple seems to have added more features into iTunes 11. iTunes 11 comes with a newly redesigned player, better album viewing to browse through your albums, integrated iCloud & Apple Stores. Even though this new iTunes comes with plenty of new helpful features, some features make it hard to use. Cover flow, the DeDuper, iTunes DJ, Gapless playback editor, Multiple Windows, the other sidebar and quick volume control, song progress in mini player are such features. Overall, iTunes 11 is lacking the easy to use factor which all of the previous iTunes possessed. Additionally, Apple has announced that the iPhone 5 will be available in South Korea on Friday and 50 more countries.\n\n[color=white][b]Facebook[/b][/color]\nRumors say that Facebook is interested in buying Whats App. Whats App is an application developed for Android, iOS, Symbian & Windows phones that allows users to send or receive text messages, images and videos. There hasn't been any official announcements regarding this neither from Facebook nor Whats App. Meanwhile during the past week, a man posted a photo with Powerball ticket in his hand claiming that he was going to offer this to any random sharer. Seems like many people wanted to have it, hence the two million shares the photo received. Later, the ticket was found to be fake and the man in the photo was actually Nolan Daniels who seems to have great knowledge in computer programming and SQL. When his brother was identified and asked about this, he confirmed it and said, \"I think he craves the love from people.\"\n\n[color=white][b]HTC[/b][/color]\nHTC announced its Windows based mobile phones, the 8S and 8X on September. The HTC 8X went on sales in AT&T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile networks in the U.S during November. Now, HTC has announced that they will not be making 8S available for the U.S to purchase. Recently, in an Engadget, HTC stated that, \"signature Windows Phone\" and said that with its focus on that handset, the 8S \"is not currently planned for distribution in the U.S. market.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbjo5C8ZAaCfSc.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Arcade Fire Plays Secret Show, Reveal New Music[/color][/b]\nAs earlier reported in this section of the Hack Forums News, Arcade Fire has been at work on a new album set for a 2013 release date. Well, it appears that the band has gotten a little anxious to showcase their new music. This past week, the Montreal band played a secret show in front of an audience of about 100. The people lucky enough to be able to attend the show had to agree not to record any audio or picture. The band performed under the alias Les Identiks. \n\n[b][color=white]Grizzly Bears, Sleigh Bells, Cults, Others To Play Sandy Benefit \n[/color][/b]Another Hurricane Sandy benefit concert will be held in New York City, taking place at Terminal 5. The concert will feature Indie sets including Colts, Sleigh Bells, Grizzly Bears, and The Antlers. The tickets to attend the show cost $40, with all proceeds set to go to the Mayor's fund for the cleanup of the NYC area after the devestating effects of the hurricane that hit just weeks ago. \n\n[b][color=white]Music Video Of The Week[/color][/b]\n[spoiler][video=youtube]http://youtu.be/rOiLVo8yIJE[/video]\n[video=youtube]http://youtu.be/x-64CaD8GXw[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nOur lives are less of our own than we may think. Although we enjoy the idea of choices and freedom, in today's world, it's simply a facade we put on for ourselves. Our lives are planned, recorded, played, twisted, changed, and sculpted. I'm not speaking of any religious foreplay, rather humanity's nature. We tend to control what we shouldn't, and change what is not ours to do so. In the younger years of humanity, a king or official controlled the course of his/her subjects. Nowadays, our government affects our futures much more than we do. It all begins at birth, the documentation, the tests... the control. As we grow, the environment that is built for us, shapes us into the perfect little citizen. We learn what is needed. The sad truth is, the control we act out for ourselves is just for personal comfort. In the end of it all, the ones who brought us into this world, and continue to run it, will be there when we leave it.\n\nMeh.",

Well i have pretty much 2 movies which are \npretty much the same deal. My first one would be The Great Escape... I FUCKING \nLOVVVVEEEE that movie.. Steve McQueen is so awesome and it is based on a real \ntrue story.. They way that escape is cleaver and it made the nazi's look stupid as \nfuck. My fave is Werner who is a ferret. Well he is one of the Nazi's but he is pretty \nawesome. I like him even he doesn't really have a big part.. Well my 2nd fave movie \nof all time would be The Lion King II Simba's Pride... I fell in love with the movie when \ni first seen the first movie... As soon as i seen the 2nd movie come out, I pretty much \ncummed in my pants. 2nd movie will always be a fave for me since it has so many \nawesome scenes in it... My fave character would be obviously Vitani because of my \nusername but when i first saw her. I INSTANTLY fell in love with her well her electric \nblue eye mostly... She pretty much has the best personality in the movie, If you must \nknow. I am a The Lion King know it all..\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651773][i]-Vitani's Mate[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"At the moment my favourite film is Men in Black 3, the reason being because \nit is still funny, you find out why Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is all grumpy all the time and it \nis very sad at the end where you dont expect it to be. I recommend every person to watch \nit, if you wasnt a fan of the other two you will be surprised with this one, its a great film. \nRunning very close behind is the film Ted, i bet every person has seen that film though so no \nneed to explain that quality film :).\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=548259][i]-r0flez[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I just saw this movie recently, and it was Wreck-It-Ralph. As soon as I saw the beginning, I \ninstantly fell in love with the movie. This movie brought back so many memories, like the games \nSonic, Q*bert, and Tapper. It was video game nostalgia as some would say. It was a heartfelt, \ntouching movie that has become my favorite.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1090190][i]-Pink Leaf Skyline[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"My all time favourite movie is V for Vendetta. It is about November 4th when Guy \nFawkes attacked parliament and stuff. I like it because V (The main character) Talks in smilies and \nmetaphors so you really have to pay attention to what he says. Its a good action movie and it also \nhas a thriller and historic appeal to it. The hacker group Anonymous wears the same mask that V \nwears, a Guy Fawkes mask.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874827][i]-EpicXXCrushor[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"What game have you been enjoying lately?
