You see it on your TV every night; you see it outside every time you go for a walk, you see it in the stores, where scarcity of stock is a big problem which in turn has proven to be a devastating factor that prevents the purchase of essential products by many of the people in need. We should stay calm and help each other instead of going with the saying, \"It's every man for himself.\" Mass panic is likely to continue spreading. However, we must not succumb to such feelings.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]The lockdown situation in Germany[/color][/b]\r\nThe Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, believes that it is too early to lift the movement restrictions enforced by the lockdown despite signs that the coronavirus disease is spreading slower than before. Merkel appealed to the people to adhere to the rules for social isolation and hygiene. The Chancellor is optimistic that she will be able to cope with the pandemic and face it with all her power to keep things from getting worse.

They also released a mobility report on each country, state, county, etc., with various categories showing an increase or decrease in people's movements. Any of them include parks, grocery stores, neighborhoods, etc. It’s off by default. Such reports will show patterns over a span of \"several weeks\" with data being collected from the last 48 to 72 hours.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.blog.google/technology/health/covid-19-community-mobility-reports] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Venmo and Cash App Offering a Hand [/color][/b]\r\nVenmo and Cash App, both popular apps among people sending each other money, are trying to make life easier for the government. With stimulus checks emerging early or later for individuals, depending on a few factors, both services have launched a public campaign to the Treasury Department to enable them to carry out checks at a much faster pace. The greatest advantage is that money is sent electronically instead of a physical check in the mail. This would benefit Americans who do not have their bank details on file with the IRS for direct deposit. Both companies are going through the initiative because they know the government needs to get the money out quickly. The Treasury refused to comment on the case.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/venmo-cash-app-stimulus/index.html] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4570721][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/animenews-megane.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]'Boku no Hero Academia' Gets Fifth Anime Season[/color][/b]\r\nThe fifth season of My Hero Academia has been announced!

Recently she was hired by the Japanese government to become an ambassador for Cool Japan and Tweeted about her excitement. You can find her Tweet [url=https://twitter.com/enako_cos/status/1245276964643987457]here[/url], which translates to \"I will do my utmost to spread the pop culture I love, as an ambassador and as a cosplayer!\". Cool Japan is a program that was created in 2002 and serves the purpose of promoting Japan's modern-day culture through its celebrities and media to countries abroad. The program is not only supported by the Japanese government but other companies in the country too! Enako has made over a million yen (around $9,000) from her career as a cosplay model. One of her life long dreams while persuing this career was to eventually get employed by the country somehow. Well, her dream finally came true and with that, good luck Enako!

Comiket is the most well-known doujinshi convention that takes place in Japan. Just like any other anime and manga convention, people can cosplay as their favorite characters, meet new people, and even purchase fan-made or professional works of art. Because of the virus, the event was canceled. But that doesn't stop those who were interested. A Comiket 98 catalog was created and posted on Amazon Japan. By purchasing the catalog, it allowed people to support the convention, despite it being canceled and the goal was to support future events. With the number of people that purchased it, the catalog then became the best selling book on Amazon Japan. However, over time, the catalog is slowly falling in the rankings and at the time of writing this, it is now in seventh place.
