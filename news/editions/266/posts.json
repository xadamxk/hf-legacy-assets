Before we begin are there any shout outs you would like to make?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] Hmm. Shoutout to all the chill guys from the Hashing & Ciphers Section. They all know who they are ;). Oh, and thanks :)\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] The encryption section is a fantastic resource. But lets go back a bit, what brought you to Hack Forums to start? We all have a story, what is yours?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] I had actually seen the forum plenty of times on Google, but what brought me here was all the talk about HF in the CS:GO cheat scene. Everyone was talking about Hack Forums and I just had to check it out :P\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] So a gamer at heart, after joining you clearly expanded from the game cheat scene, what drew you to the other areas? I actually never knew you as a gamer per say, being I met you mostly through the Remote admin section. What caused your curiosity to expand to the other sections, and why?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] I have always had an interest for hacking, exploiting and the kind of stuff you would find on HF. I just never looked for a community revolving around it. After originally joining as a gamer I decided to look around to see what the forum had to offer. That's when I noticed all the other interesting content available. From there I started looking into the RAT section and also Hash Cracking.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] I believe your still in the educational area in life, do you have any specialized computer training, or do you have a focus towards a formal training in the IT industry planned?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] I have no \"formal\" training or degree, everything I know is self-learned. I would love to work in the IT industry, not quite sure what I would like to do though. It would probably be something like Programming or Cryptography.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url] A lot of people tend to knock \"Self taught\" people, I personally believe its a major misjudgment.  Those who learn on their own accord are going to go above and beyond the standard, simply because they actually are interested in the subject.  That being said, you have demonstrated a real interest in the crypto aspect of computing. Algorithms are fun, but what is it about cryptology that interests you and what would you like to do with the knowledge you gain from researching that field.\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] I guess it's the challenge. Being able to decrypt something that is made with the purpose of not being cracked is exciting. If I ever decide to pursue this field, my goal would be to make the internet a safer place. So many websites are getting hacked and personal data is being leaked all over the place.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] A very valid approach, more companies are hiring known hackers on a daily basis, with the attempt to fight fire with fire, so to speak.\nEncryption and hashing/salting out a code tends to take a high amount of mathematical calculations, It would be safe to assume your reasonably skilled in the mathematics field as well, and your note towards programming would indicate such as well.  Any kind of plans for a release or project in the future geared towards either of these aspects?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] I am definitely looking into projects I could spend some time on. Currently I am still in the learning phase and there are plenty of excellent coders and cryptographers on Hack Forums with MUCH more knowledge than me. Releasing an inferior product is not something I am aiming for. When I feel like I got enough to release something innovative and of high quality I will definitely do it :) Currently I am just soaking in all the information and learning as much as I can about the subjects that interest me. I am always looking for fun project ideas.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] True enough, I know many get a great start in business and marketing using the Hack Forums marketplace. Which at times can be a wild west of the internet itself.  But from the general demeanor I am aware of you, you seem to be more focused on returning what you learn back in to the community instead of so many others who can only really be considered \"Hit and runners\". There can be a lot of criticism geared against the community you take membership in, what are your thoughts towards all of that?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] The Hack Forums community is something unique and I have never been apart of anything like it. With such a big community you got all types of people and it would be naive to think that everyone here is going to be awesome people and a pleasure to be around. Overall I really like the HF community. I have met some truly awesome people here and I consider them friends. Discussing thought and ideas with other HF members have taught me a lot about the IT industry in general. There is so much to learn here and that's because of the awesome community.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Well I can only agree, there is a draw to the community, and everyone has their own unique reason.  I always personally found the communities diversity to be a major draw, input from around the world on the same topic, but from so many perspectives. But, we are nearly out of time, is there any thing further you would like to add to this interview?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to thank you and the HF news team for giving me to opportunity to do this interview. I would also like to thank all the members on HF that actively provide educational content and help other members. This place wouldn't be the same without you.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] There is one last question which needs to be asked, and every member who is interviewed is asked the same.\nIf you could change anything about the site or community, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest I haven't really thought about it. There are definitely a few issues that come to mind, but I don't really know any smart or good ways to fix them.   My biggest issues with Hack Forums is all the scamming, but its an hard issue to tackle. Hopefully someone will come up with a genius plan someday and fix it.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Well, the marketplace has been called a lot of things, I personally choose to look at it like the American wild west.   Anything almost can go and there is limited regulation.  However, I do believe the design is in place this way for a reason, but do agree the scamming can be an issue.\nAny recommendations for new users wanting to use the marketplace?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2703452][color=white][b]LSDoom:[/b][/color][/url] Even though rep, post count etc. means something, you shouldn't rely on it. A member might look trusted,  but the account could be compromised or the individual could be on a scamming spree. Using a trusted middleman is your best bet to avoid getting scammed, but even that won't work every time due to chargebacks. Yeah, that's pretty much it :)\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Good advice\nArmada: Well my friend that wraps it up I think, I and the HF news staff would like to extend out appreciation for the interview, and I truly to hope to see you posting around!\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The terrorist group ISIS has claimed responsibility for the wave of attacks, alleging eight members involved in the attack. Of the eight that ISIS claims participated, seven have been killed. Six locations in total were attacked. The Stade de France was the site of multiple explosions, the result of three suicide bombers. Four people were killed in the explosions just outside the stadium, while a soccer match between France and Germany was played. The deadliest of the attacks took place at the Bataclan concert hall, where an American band, Eagles of Death Metal was playing. Three attackers arrived at the hall and opened fire on the crowd. Some wounded audience members were gathered before the stage and killed execution style. Police stormed the hall, and all four attackers were killed by their explosive belts and police gunfire. 89 people total were killed in the Bataclan attack. Another nineteen people were killed as a result of suicide bombings at four different restaurants and cafes over a period of approximately fifteen minutes, displaying the high level of coordination and planning of these attacks. Countries around the world are showing their support for France. Since the attacks, France has declared a state of emergency, and has deployed numerous air strikes over ISIS territory in Raqqa, Syria. Damage and casualties caused by the strike are unknown at this time. \n\n[url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tanzania/12000717/Tanzania-hails-miracle-of-miners-rescued-after-41-days-underground.html][b][color=#FFFFFF]Miners Rescued in Tanzania After 41 Days Underground[/color][/b][/url]\nAfter spending 41 days trapped underground, five miners have been rescued, nearly starved to death. It is believed that twenty total miners were trapped when their tunnel collapsed on them, filling with sand. Fourteen of the escaped, the other six were left behind. One of the six died during their time underground, and the rest were only discovered when others working nearby heard their cries for help. The miners survived by eating insects and frogs, and by drinking muddy water that trickled down from the surface. All of the remaining survivor were taken to a hospital, and are still in serious condition. \n\n[url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/17/us-france-shooting-usa-idUSKCN0T62FB20151117#Tt7yw0Lf1zu4r9p5.97][b][color=#FFFFFF]Some United States Governors Fight Against Accepting Refugees[/color][/b][/url] \nThe crisis in Syria has given rise to an unprecedented number of refugees fleeing the war torn country, seeking aid from surrounding civilized countries. While many European countries have already accepted them by the score, and the U.S. has plans laid to accept them, some U.S. governors are fighting back. The recent attacks in France have prompted a heightened level of caution and fear among many countries considered a target of ISIS. Multiple sports matches, and various other large events have been canceled in the wakes of the terror in Paris. U.S. lawmakers implemented a more intense level of scrutiny for the refugees making their way into the states. Republican house leaders in particular are increasingly worried about possible attacks on U.S. soil via the flow of refugees, where a potential ISIS agent might enter the country unchecked. House Speaker Paul Ryan said \"This is a moment where it is better to be safe than sorry.\" While many of the states governors are outright opposing the idea of providing refuge to the fleeing Syrians, the final matter may still be determined at the federal level.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/HackingNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Wires.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/11/parisattacks-anonymous-isis.html][b][color=white]Anonymous and ISIS Go Head to Head[/color][/b][/url]\nIn light of the recent terrorist attack which struck the heart of France on November 13, Anonymous declare war on ISIS. Anonymous has labelled the mission \"#OpParis\" in a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwGGcZoRs-k]video[/url], and has given their oath to wreak havoc and punish those responsible for the tragic events recently carried out in Paris. The hacktivist group informs ISIS that they should expect \"many many cyber attacks\" shortly before expressing their sympathy towards the country. The group aim to rid social media of ISIS's channels and populated accounts which support their nuisance throughout the world. Previously, Anonymous has and still continues to aid the cyber security of France due to the shooting of Charlie Hebdo.

Recently, hackers have been able to listen in on any phone calls made from the Samsung Galaxy. This is made possible by hackers mimicking telephone towers. The telephone tower in question is called OpenBTS. German researchers have found this to be possible in the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, and Note 4 products released by Samsung.\n\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2015/11/malware-detected-in-martels-cameras.html][b][color=white]Police Department Infected With Malware[/color][/b][/url]\nPolice departments within the U.S has unknowingly been infected with malware, which then tried to replicate itself onto other machines within the same network. The malware itself can be found in police cameras provided by Martel. Martel is based in Florida, and is one of the biggest providers of cameras to the police. The replication of malware can be done by connecting the police camera to a computer. The same malware within the police cameras, has been previously reported to be within computers also.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color] \n\n[align=center]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Angel.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=left]\n[color=white][url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/13/technology/verizon-activation-fee/][b]Verizon to Charge $20 Activation Fee for Devices[/b][/url][/color]\nIf your cell phone bill was not ridiculously expensive already, Verizon has decided to tack something else on and start charging its customers a $20 activation fee. Starting on November 15, which is the same date the price hike for unlimited plans goes into effect, Verizon will charge customers adding a new line of service a one-time $20 fee for doing so. It is important to note that the fee only applies to the contract-free plans that Verizon introduced over the summer, which initially did not include an activation fee. Customers who held on to their contracts still have to pay a $40 activation fee to add a new line, Verizon spokeswoman Kelly Crummey tells CNN Money.\n\n[color=white][url=http://bgr.com/2015/11/12/drove-video-3d-printed-uav-flight/][b]World's First 3D-Printed, Jet-Powered UAV[/b][/url][/color]\nThe future of aerospace was on display at the Dubai Airshow, and surprisingly enough, not on the tarmac. Aurora Flight Sciences, a manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles, and Stratasys, a 3D printing company, have teamed up to build the world’s first jet-powered, 3D printed aircraft. Dan Campbell, aerospace research engineer at Aurora Flight Sciences, explains how the UAV project met a number of goals using Stratasys 3D printing solutions in the following [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e--5u2LpHU]video[/url]. The sleek drone has a 3m wingspan and is almost 80 percent printed, the exceptions being the jet engine, avionics and landing gear. Made of lightweight plastic and a highly heat-resistant printed metal, the aircraft can fly at more than 150 miles per hour for up to seven minutes.\n\n[color=white][url=http://www.engadget.com/2015/11/13/gene-amdahl-mainframe-computing/][b]Gene Amdahl, Mainframe Computing Pioneer, Passes Away At 92[/b][/url][/color]\nGene Amdahl, the man responsible for the modern design of the mainframe computer, passed away on Tuesday, Nov. 10 at the age of 92. Dr. Amdahl is known for is work with IBM, more specifically on the IBM 704, IBM 709 and other projects. He also spearheaded the design of the IBM's System/360 mainframe, the first computer system not built for a specific purpose and instead offered modularity, interoperability, and the use of cheaper third-party peripherals. Announced in 1964, it made IBM the industry leader of mainframes by expanding the market from government offices and universities to everyday businesses such as airlines and carmakers. The 360 series would ultimately become the blueprint for comprehensive designs of the same industry.\n[/align]",

This could be due to users wokring on possible projects that were mentioned in the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5053760]265th addition[/url] of the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=162]Hackforums News[/url].\n\nI reached out to site owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], this week in hopes of finding out some official updates regarding Omnicoin.  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] politely declined my request for an unknown reason; [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] might have something new in store for Omnicoin but does not want to release it to the public just yet.  In the next Hackforums News addition I will reach out to another member of the Omnicoin development team and ask them questions regarding the future of Omnicoin.  If you have any questions that you would like to ask them please send [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][b]Who Soup[/b][/url] a private message.\n\nFor those of you who are not up to speed with what has been happening with Omnicoin, a thread has been made titled \"[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5045534]Update me[/url]\" which commentators have summed up what has been happening recently with Omnicoin.  Currently, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has removed the exclusivity of having to upgrade 3p1c with OMC.  Users can now upgrade to 3p1c with BTC,LTC, and DODGE.  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has also stated that he will be ending his support for Omnicoin though not much has progressed after that statement was released.  There is also an Omnicoin plugin that allows users to attach your Omnicoin address to your profile.  This plugin also features a list of the richest Omnicoin holders which is a really cool feature which may boost the popularity of Omnicoin; you can find this plugin at [url]http://hackforums.net/coins.php[/url].  \n\n\n[b]Weekly Highlights[/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5045534][b]Update me[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1302310][b][color=#00AAFF]Crypto Miner[/color][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4760167][b]OMC-Rates Changes/Updates (Last Updated on April 9)[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][b]Cryptic™[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5046822][b]Is it possible to sell OMC on HF?[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2589803][b][color=#99FF00]TurtleClub[/color][/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Nobility.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Leadership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=525019][color=#EFEFEF][b]illuminati▲[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Axiom.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#EFEFEF][b]Optimized[/b][/color][/url] was removed as leader of Axiom.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#EFEFEF][b]Roger Waters[/b][/color][/url] stepped down as leader of The Brotherhood. \n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5005329][b]HF News Team // Become a Writer - Apply now![/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5054694][b]Axiom | Recruitment Phase | [Official][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4917838][b]Crypto | Official Cryptocurrency Group | Creation Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4978029][b]Echo | Recruitment | Hang with the best[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4982908][b]Null | Official Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5018163][b][LEGENDS] Official Recruitment - Network Exploitation and Programmers![/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4949047][b][Official Group Royalty] > Looking for Developers & Designers <[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5008786][b][SPECIALISTS] General Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4932933][b]Titans | Official Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Related Buy-ins & Informational Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5011893][b]Axiom | Official Group | Re-brand Inc | Leader Spot | PP / BTC / WU [$1K][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4995862][b][Divine] || Official Group || Leadership Position Available || [$900][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5036270][b]Null | Student Program[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4970797][b]Official Group Divine[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4456035][b]Titans | Official Group[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group and Crew General Discussions Spotlight Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5050509][b]Need Ideas for a new official group.[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5057633][b]Official Group \"Escrow\".
