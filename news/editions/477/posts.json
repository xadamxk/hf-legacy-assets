It claimed that they would double any Bitcoin sent to their address, in the next 30 minutes, as a part of their giving back. Unbeknownst to many unsuspecting victims, this was not the case. It was a scam. Malicious actors had reportedly gained access to a Twitter admin panel through social engineering. It allowed them to gain control of accounts that belonged to celebrities and politicians, among others, and then send out tweets. The perpetrators managed to trick over 300 people into sending them almost 13 Bitcoin. That's approximately $120,000. The BTC was transferred to different wallets that may have connections with Binance, BitGo, and Coinbase, according to Cointelegraph's analysis. Bitcoin Core developer Wladimir van der Laan said that some of the victims might get their Bitcoin back, through a double-spend attack. That would involve sending another transaction of the same value with a higher fee than the previous one.[i][size=x-small][url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-hacker-admin-scam/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Credit Scores Coming to Decentralized Finance[/color][/b]\r\nTeller Finance has raised $1 million in a seed round lead by Framework Ventures. Teller is an algorithmic credit risk protocol that aims to \"enable the creation of decentralized lending markets that can offer unsecured loans.\" They want to bring together the best of both worlds and give people instantly accessible loans, powered by blockchain technology, while still keeping the traditional idea of credit scores. Users who want to take out a loan can use their credit score provided by centralized financial data. This enables decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to offer loans without requiring as much collateral. The founder of Teller, Ryan Berkun, said that it would be possible to go \"down to zero collateral.\" DeFi loans don't stop there, though. They can also affect your credit score. If a borrower were to default on a loan, their credit score would down, similar to how centralized lending markets work.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200716005148/en/Teller-Raises-1-Million-Seed-Led-Framework/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]John McAfee's Promise[/color][/b]\r\nIn 2017, the founder of McAfee, John McAfee, made a bold statement. He tweeted that he thought Bitcoin would reach $500,000 within three years. He didn't stop there. Replying to another Twitter user, McAfee made a bet and said that he would \"eat [his] dick on national television\" if it did not. That tweet was posted on July 17. It has now been three years, and, well, Bitcoin has not reached $500,000 yet. It's hovering at just over $9,100. In a rather disappointing turn, McAfee tweeted on July 17, 2020, claiming that three years means three years and six months. People will have to check back in at the end of the year to see if he's carrying out his promise.[i][size=x-small][url=https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/887024683379544065] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4570721][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/animenews-megane.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]New Love Live! Project to be Titled Love Live! Superstar!![/color][/b]\r\nAnother installment for the \"Love Live!\" series has been announced. The upcoming anime has been dubbed, \"Love live! Superstar!!\" and will revolve around five new characters, Shibuya Kanon, Tang Keke, Arashi Chisato, Heanna Sumire, and Hazuki Ren. The five characters are based out of Yuigaoka Girls High School, and what makes this new is the usage of the term \"band.\" Usually, with this series, the girls are considered  part of a \"group\" rather than a band. Does this mean that the usage of musical instruments will also be included? Not much is known so far about this anime, so stay tuned.

Your favorite maids, Rem and Ram, have returned. If you haven't done so already, two short, separate trailers were released for [url=https://youtu.be/Zzv42rrtUbM]Rem[/url] and [url=https://youtu.be/94_4zvvXuUM]Ram[/url]. It is also good to note that the anime's second season will have two parts. The first 13 episodes will air during the current summer 2020 season, while the remaining second half is scheduled to air in January of next year. [i][size=x-small][url=https://otakumode.com/news/5f02ea3ed6feadd81793ea78/Re-Zero-s-Rem-and-Ram-Star-in-Season-2-Trailers!]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Fly Me to the Moon Anime Releases New Teaser Trailer![/color][/b]\r\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" has released a 30-second preview on [url=https://youtu.be/3M7w-ROU62U]YouTube[/url] and features one of the voice actors, Enoki Junya who will be portraying the protagonist, Nasa. If you look at the video preview, you will notice that the girl in it, known as Tsukasa, looks like the girl from Porter Robinson's [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0]Shelter[/url] music video! Of course, there is no correlation between the two, but it is something cute to consider! The anime will be adapted from the manga created by Hata Kenjirou. \"A boy named Nasa is saved from a truck accident by a mysterious girl, Tsukasa. After he confesses his love to her, she agrees to date him only if they get married. Three years later, she arrives on his doorstep to fulfill this promise.\" [i][size=x-small][url=https://otakumode.com/news/5f0ec39a4ccab3bf272eaa57/Fly-Me-to-the-Moon-Anime-Releases-New-Teaser-Trailer!]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Haikyuu!!: To the Top 2nd Cour to Air from October![/color][/b]\r\nIf you follow the \"Haikyuu\" series, you will be delighted to know that the second cour of the fourth season will air sometime this October. For those unaware of what a cour is, generally, a season in anime is classified as a cour. For example, an anime with 12 episodes is one cour. If it were to have a second season, the additional episodes after that are a second cour. Usually, you would label the anime as a \"two-cour\" anime. In other words, it is a fancy way of saying two seasons! A 30-second [url=https://twitter.com/animehaikyu_com/status/1282600575763312640?s=20]Tweet[/url] was also posted showing off the boys from Karasuno High School's volleyball team.

This week’s new moon in your domestic sector could direct you to get a move on. Whether you want to redecorate, welcome a pet, or begin a small business, this is the time to do so.\r\n\r\nThe sun opposes sobering Saturn the same day, and you may realize what you need to do to create a better work/life balance. If this means making more time for homey activities or deciding to work from home, this move could turn out to be good for you.\r\n\r\nSome relief is on the way as the sun moves into Leo midweek for a four-week stay. It encourages you to become more playful and allow your inner child to express itself through art, music, or anything else you find absorbing.\r\n\r\nFinally, as messenger Mercury aligns with electric Uranus midweek, you could get the perfect gadget that helps make your life much easier.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Fresh developments in your communication sector hint at an opportunity that you might relish.

This lively lunar phase encourages you to jettison old beliefs that may be keeping you stuck in a certain lifestyle, job, or even relationship. It’s time to let go of the past and blossom.\r\n\r\nPlus, the sun’s move into Leo and your home and family sector could inspire you to get involved in more family-oriented activities. If you have time to beautify your home or create some art or crafts to enhance the atmosphere, you’ll enjoy doing so.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"This week’s new moon in your personal money zone can usher in a new beginning if you want one.

Whatever your problem, there is a way out if you can get the right help and advice and you follow through on it. There is no need to suffer unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note, the sun’s move into Leo and your sector of communication can put a positive spin on things. Because of this, you may begin to see improvements sooner rather than later. This is the time to promote your work, business, and abilities, whether online or off. And the more you do so, the better for you.\r\n\r\nAre you in need of a bright idea?

If you know what it is, this is the time to start.\r\n\r\nHowever, as this new moon also opposes cautious Saturn in your relationship sector, there is a chance that someone may try to stop you.

This might include meditation, mindfulness, a practice such as yoga or tai chi, or even finding a teacher or life coach to work with, online or off. By attending to your inner life, your outer life can flourish, and this new moon is the time to make a start.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it’s opposed by prudent Saturn in your lifestyle sector, which suggests that being overly busy could stop you from integrating these new habits into your everyday life. This is an opportunity to be discriminating and jettison anything that is a waste of time. In fact, good time management can be crucial to your success.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the sun moves into your sign midweek for a four-week stay, giving you a new lease on life.

With the new moon in Cancer, you could join an interesting group, decide to move in new circles, or make the acquaintance of someone who becomes a supportive friend. Whatever actions you take can enrich your life because of the people you’ll meet.\r\n\r\nThis new moon opposes taskmaster Saturn in your leisure zone, so one side of you might prefer to enjoy plenty of alone time doing your own thing. And while this can help you hone a skill or perfect a talent, you could miss out on the rich interactions that can be yours if you get out and about.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the sun’s move into Leo and a secluded sector for four weeks can be a chance to reflect on your present situation. Do you need to find closure on anything?

The new moon is in your sector of goals and ambitions on Monday, so this is the time to do so. It’s worth using this lunar energy to help build momentum as you kick-start a new plan or project.\r\n\r\nIs there anything that could stop you? Because this lunar phase opposes Saturn in your home and family sector, there’s a chance that domestic responsibilities could hold you back.

The new moon in your sector of far horizons encourages you to take the road less traveled and be bold.\r\n\r\nHowever, as it also opposes prudent Saturn, a fear of the unknown could hold you back. If you want to take your life in a new and exciting direction, you’ll need to move beyond this, feel the fear, and do it anyway.\r\n\r\nThis message can also apply to your goals and ambitions as the sun moves into Leo and a prominent sector of your chart.

The right balance of inner and outer can be better, though.\r\n\r\nIf you’re ready to have some fun, the sun’s move into your travel and adventure zone encourages you to broaden your horizons and take a well-deserved trip if you’re able to.
