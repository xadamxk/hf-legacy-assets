The Christmas banner is up, the threads are everywhere; you can't escape it. It's Christmas time at Hack Forums. Everyone seems to be generally in a happy mood. Whether you hate it or not, it seems to have relaxed everyone a bit around the site. So go ahead and indulge yourself in one of the dozens of Christmas threads; bragging about your gifts, gifts you have bought for others, or maybe even showcasing a good deed done for someone else in the name of Christmas. Whatever your opinion is about this time of year, you can't deny it: Christmas has a profound effect on the culture of this very special site. On top of that, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has released a jolly youtube video for you to enjoy, see it [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VutTgh0J-7w]here[/url]. Merry Christmas!\r\n\n[b][color=white][color=#ff3131]Server [/color][color=white]Problems/[/color][color=#1fff1f]Downtime[/color][/color][/b]\r\nThis week, the site continued to face downtime for extended periods of time, at one point for four hours. These crashes have been attributed to memory limitations. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is currently in the process of upgrading the servers but is waiting for the datacenter to clear up some memory.    \r\n\n[b][color=white][color=#ff3131]Omniscient [/color][color=white]Runs Hou[/color][color=#1fff1f]secleaning[/color][/color][/b]\r\nSite-owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] spent the last week doing some housecleaning for the forums. All zero post members were deleted, while old PMs were pruned. This is a regular occurrence that takes place every now and then to free up some much needed space. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also tweeted that he had finished a month worth of UB3R applications that had stacked up onto his workload.

Any shoutouts you want to make to friends?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: I'm more than glad to be here. I'd like to give a special shout out to Daisy, each and every member of 143, Nidhish & Vegeta. I'd also like to thank +Entity for allowing me to be interviewed.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: What gave you the idea for 143? The name and expression of the group is certainly the first of its kind.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: The full story can be found here: http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=2878191&pid=27294890#pid27294890 - but to shorten it up, it's something Daisy and I have used for a long time. We've joked in the past about owning a group of our own, but as groups were so expensive, we didn't think it would happen. Eventually we both got more and more into Hackforums, and that's when Omniscient was contacted. This was before groups were no longer allowed to be purchased, and that's how we became the last purchased Hackforums group. We decided that 143 would be a perfect name for our group, especially with the meaning behind it, and what kind of group we wanted to be. We were both surprised by all of the support we received.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How did you get the money to purchase the group?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: Contrary to popular belief, 143 is not owned by me. It is owned by Daisy. Although I am helping out with some payments, I do not think she would like to publicly state where the money came from.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: No problem. How did Daisy choose to work with you versus other members?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: That's something else that other people get confused about. People think we are in some 'Hackforums relationship' - though we've known each other for years and have been together longer than we've both been on Hackforums. We're in a LDR and have been in one for 9 months, though in the past we had been together for a year. We had discussed owning a group but never really had a serious discussion about it, and then boom, all it took was a serious discussion, some PM's, and we were set to own a group together.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do you know each other IRL, or are you related online?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: We don't. She lives in Alabama, and I live in Canada. We've not met yet, but we do hope to (we will, soon). Although many people criticize our relationship, we're not worried about what others think at this point. While on Hackforums we focus on ourselves, those that matter & 143.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How have you been able to cultivate such a benevolent and generous atmosphere around the ground? It's contagious, for lack of a better word.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: We've both always been generous people. Her more so than myself, but giving to others and back to the community is something that we have done here for a while now and plan to do so for a long time. 143 is a group about giving, regardless of what form it may be. We don't care if a user gives by helping people, or by holding $1,000 contests - both are the same in our eyes. 143 has helped us both in the long run, mostly because of what has become of the group. We're more of a family than a group, and that's something majority of 143 members will tell you.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Is there anything specific you look for in prospective 143 members? Or is it a specific quality that can't quite be described?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: For sure a specific qualities that can't be described. There is not one specific quality, but many that we look for in members. We also need to both agree that the member is right for the group. If something seems off about the member, something usually is. Of course we've had a few members removed, a few members leave - but that was expected when the group came out. We're still a new group and with all things good come not-so-good things. Although we lost a few members, we gained a few more great members.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do current group members often vote on prospective members, or is it entirely up to you and Daisy?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: A nomination type thread or system was discussed, but Daisy and I decided against it. At the moment, and more than likely always, Daisy and I hand-select members ourselves and 'check them out' on our own. When 143 was launched, we did have Yellows help us with the first wave of invites, though. Other than that, who's invited is entirely up to myself and Daisy.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do you and Daisy handle all 143 affairs, or do you have co-leaders?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: At the beginning of 143, Yellows was pretty much our RHM. We both do trust him very much, and if something comes up we can count on him to help out. Although we don't have an official co-leader, and we never will (it will always remain only Daisy and I as leaders) - Yellows is someone that has always been there to give us a hand, even before 143. As of late, we've all been working as a group to sort any issues.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Everyone in the group votes on new ideas, giveaways, and initiatives. Is that correct?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: We've got a thread titled \"Group Activity/Project Discussion\" where members can come up with new ideas or projects that as a group we can all work on together. So far, we've had a total of 8 projects. We've also got a thread for 'Group Suggestions' that members can use to help us improve as a group or if they think something should be added/changed/looked into.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You've put a lot of work into the group, Cody. Impressive. What future plans does 143 hold for the rest of the forum?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: I have, for sure. Daisy and I both have a large portion of our time into 143. We want it to be the best it can be. I do personally want to thank all of our members for helping us make 143 what it's become, though, as without them it would be nothing. When it comes to future plans, we're for sure going to keep doing what we're already doing, and hopefully more.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#1fff1f][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad to see that 143 has some plans in store for us. Any closing comments for the readers?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=#ff3131][b]Cody[/b][/color][/url]: I'd like to wish everyone happy holidays.

Firstly, I'll briefly introduce the section and its writer. I, Phytrix, will be writing the HackerCraft News section - at least for now and the forseeable future. This section will explore the most prominent weekly happenings in Hackercraft, and will also showcase various popular and/or notable threads. For those of you that don't know what HackerCraft is, it's HF's official Minecraft server. It has a dedicated subforum that can be seen [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=252][b]here[/b][/url]. I was selected for this job as I myself am a very active Hackercraft player and can analyse the weekly happenings, having written various articles in various sections for the HF News in the past. I will attempt to be as unbias as possible in writing these articles. If you feel I am being bias, feel free to shoot me a friendly PM. Also, we don't need reports for this section. I'm more than capable of finding and analysing prominent events and threads in one select section. What better time for a new section?\n\n[b][color=#ff3131]1.4.6 [/color][color=white]Up[/color][color=#1fff1f]date[/b][/color]\nWell... talk about a rough update. Minecraft's new update, 1.4.6, was released earlier in the week and had a drastic effect on plugins, and in result, on MC servers including HC. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] juggled around constantly with plugins and bugs. He managed to learn a lot about plugins during these drastic times, spending hours upon hours actively on the HackerCraft server assisting users and managing plugins. Many plugins were removed and some modified/replaced. When the server was first updated from 1.4.5 to 1.4.6, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] realised that most plugins had yet to update, hence resulting in major bugs and broken plugins. The server was reverted to a blank, where users had no items and plugins. The server was relatively quickly reinstated, and without a much requested downgrade, the server went by on its merry way. Most plugins were updated within 24 hours or so, excluding the plugin which manages the /chest feature. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also scratched the NoCheat+ plugin for AntiCheat, which has enraged players. That being said, it's thought that after settings are manipulated, AntiCheat won't be so much of a ho ho ho!\n\n[b][color=#ff3131]Genuine and [/color][color=white]Conception's Ho[/color][color=#1fff1f]liday Scavenger Hunt![/b][/color]\nA few days ago, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=646916][b][color=lime]Genuine[/color][/url][/b] (Genbti) and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=588904][color=#0066FF][b]Conception[/b][/color][/url] (digitalconcept) from TheCompany posted a thread about a Christmas scavenger hunt that they were hosting to all members of HackerCraft! The thread aroused the inner pirate in many of us as various users took to the biomes in their boats and boots, some with the extra assistance of swiftness potions and other advantages (you know what I mean). As of yet, the treasure remains untouched. Four images were released on the thread: one of the loot, and three of the area. The target for aspiring or already active adventurers is a large Christmas tree, dotted with various valuable blocks, such as diamond blocks, emerald blocks, iron blocks, gold blocks and glowstone. There is also a beacon and chests full of enchanted armour, tools, weapons, ores and other valuables. The thread can be seen [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3118340][b]here[/b][/url], and be sure to thank TheCompany for an even more enjoyable holiday season! Good luck adventurers.\n\n[b][color=#ff3131]Misc.

A South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said, \"As a result of analyzing the material of Unha-3 (North Korea's rocket), we judged North Korea had secured a range of more than 10,000 km in case the warhead is 500-600 kg.\" North Korea's rocket launch on December 12th propelled a satellite into orbit. Opponents of North Korea claim that the launch is one stop closer to them developing nuclear missile technology.\n\n[b][color=#ff3131]Egypt's Consti[/color][color=white]tution Likely to Be[/color][color=#1fff1f]come Official[/color][/b]\nA referendum in Egypt is said to show that the majority of Egyptian citizen approve of the drafted Constitution. In fact, it was said to be a rough 64% approval rating. The committee overseeing the referendum will likely hear appeals until Monday before declaring the official results. The Muslim Brotherhood publicly stated that the official approval of the Constitution is \"a historic opportunity to unite all national powers on the basis of mutual respect and honest dialogue for the sake of stabilizing the nation.\" There is still a minority of people who oppose the Constitution which contains Sharia law in it and one critic said, \"They are ruling the country, running the vote and influencing the people, so what else could we expect.\"\n\n[color=white][b][color=#ff3131]Russia Intro[/color][color=white]duces Sanct[/color][color=#1fff1f]ions on US[/color][/b][/color]\nRussian legislators have introduced proposed laws that will put a ban on U.S. citizens adopting Russian babies. These could come as a concern to many US citizens who were aspiring to adopt a Russian baby. Patrick Ventrell said, \"The United States is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the Russian Duma today that, if it becomes law, would halt inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia and would restrict the ability of Russian civil society organizations to work with American partners\"\n\n[b][color=#ff3131]\"1 Million New Doc[/color][color=white]uments\" Says [/color][color=#1fff1f]Julian Assange[/color][/b]\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has publicly stated that the organization will release over 1 million new documents in 2013. Assange spent over six months in an Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid arrest by British authorities. The controversial man stated, \"This building .. has become my home, my office and my refuge...thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorian government and the support of its people, I am safe in this embassy to speak from this embassy.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1FqQC[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b][color=#ff3131]Sa[/color][color=white]ms[/color][color=#1fff1f]ung[/color][/b][/color]\nA new exploit has been found on Samsung. A XDA developer found the exploit when he was experimenting to find a new way to root his Samsung Galaxy S3. This was found with the handle 'alephzain' which lies in Exynos 4 which is the RAM system used for Samsung smartphones. This exploit allows users to access any app to extract data from RAM injecting malicious code into the Kernel. This however was not present in the Nexus 10 as it uses Exynos 5. Samsung announced that they're working to fix this exploit and said, \"Samsung is aware of the potential security issue related to the Exynos processor and plans to provide a software update to address it as quickly as possible. The issue may arise only when a malicious application is operated on the affected devices; however, this does not affect most devices operating credible and authenticated applications. Samsung will continue to closely monitor the situation until the software fix has been made available to all affected mobile devices.\"\n\n[color=white][b][color=#ff3131]Fac[/color][color=white]eb[/color][color=#1fff1f]ook[/color][/b][/color]\nFacebook is working on a new Timeline. They confirmed to the ABC News stating that they're working on this with a small percentage of people and that they're doing it to make Timeline even more easier for their users. ABC has said that this will bring us a new Timeline that includes a tabbed look, allowing users to switch between friends, photos, and a person's About page. In addition, Facebook's current method of displaying Timeline updates by placing them in two columns has been modified to show updates on the left and friend and photo information on the right side. Last week, Facebook has added a new \"Facebook Privacy\" button in order to ensure that the users find it more easier to edit their privacy settings. Note that they have not made any changes to what their users can edit the settings to.\n\n[color=white][b][color=#ff3131]Mic[/color][color=white]ros[/color][color=#1fff1f]oft[/color][/b][/color]\nMicrosoft's newest tablet Surface Pro is arriving soon. The Surface Pro is going to be the first tablet on earth with 64-bit computing and will be powered with Intel Core i5 Ivy Bridge processors. BitLocker security has been added which encrypts your hard disk's data. This tablet comes with a pen which is useful for business users, a mini display port through which you can your device to high resolution displays and a 10.6-inch display screen. The tablet also include several other ports such as Micro SDXc, USB 3.0, headphone jacket and cover port. This tablet has high expectations and is estimated to be one of the highest computing tablets to date.\n\n[color=white][b][color=#ff3131]Yo[/color][color=white]uT[/color][color=#1fff1f]ube[/color][/b][/color]\nThis week, YouTube had one of its videos making a new record. 'Gangnam Style' by Psy has blown off roof tops and has reached a new record of one billion views. This is the first video to reach such a milestone. Before this achievement was reached, it was Justin Bieber's 'Baby' which was the most viewed video with around 803 million views. But 'Gangam Style' has broke this record in a mere five months. Wordstream reports say that this video has been viewed 4000 times every minute. \"Gangnam Style\" has also earned a Guinness World Records title as the most-liked video in YouTube history with over two million thumb ups. Here is the video: [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0]link[/url].\n\n[color=white][b][color=#ff3131]Ve[/color][color=white]ri[/color][color=#1fff1f]zon[/color][/b][/color]\nA bit of a story has blown up over the last week, as our very own [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337]Tibit[/url] has claimed responsibility for hacking Verizon of nearly three-million customers' data. More specifically, Verizon FiOS customers. After releasing around three-hundred thousand entries of data, news websites took it off the ground. He has claimed that he let Verizon know of their discrepancy, and was only ignored. It would seem that Verizon is now doing as all corporate companies do: denying everything. One thing we know for sure, is that the data is real. It has matched several customers, and others have verified it. Yet, the saddest part of all, is that it was all stored in plain-text. That's right, no encryption. \n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1FqRt[/img][/align]\n[b][color=#ff3131]Gang[/color][color=white]nam S[/color][color=#1fff1f]tyle[/color][/b]\nGangnam Style just became the first YouTube video to have more than 1,000,000,000 views on Youtube. The video made its debut on Youtube on July 15 and surpassed Bieber's \"Baby\" video in November. However, Justin Bieber's music label won't be too upset as PSY has been working for the same company since September. PSY's 'Gangnam Style' video reached one billion views on December 21st, the day the world was supposed to end. \n\n[b][color=#ff3131]Chris[/color][color=white]tmas [/color][color=#1fff1f]Rap[/color][/b] \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=370475]Vegas[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=628259]import antigravity[/url] made some raps for Christmas; their thread can be viewed [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3110346]here[/url]. \n\n[b][color=#ff3131]Mus[/color][color=white]ic Vi[/color][color=#1fff1f]deos[/color][/b]\n[spoiler=]\n[b][color=#ff3131]#1 Music V[/color][color=white]ideo of t[/color][color=#1fff1f]he Week[/color][/b]\n[video=youtube]http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0[/video]\n\n[b][color=#ff3131]Member Sug[/color][color=white]gested Mu[/color][color=#1fff1f]sic Videos[/color][/b]\n[video=youtube]http://youtu.be/_4BObpNQqNo[/video]\n[video=youtube]http://youtu.be/K5bo4VDEH-U[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1FqSf[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n[b][color=#ff3131]-[/color][color=white]-[/color][color=#1fff1f]-[/color][color=#ff3131]-[/color][color=white]-[/color][color=#1fff1f]-[/color][color=#ff3131]-[/color][color=white]-[/color][color=#1fff1f]-[/color][/b]\nWhat a fantastic edition!
