This wholesome discussion has already racked up 46+ replies as members nominate - and sometimes jokingly argue - over who deserves the title of HF's kindest soul. Another feel-good moment on the forum that reminds us how awesome the HF community really is.\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6309116]The 42-Cent Deal: Elon Musk Leases Grok AI to Entire US Government[/url][/color][/size][/b][/u] - [b]by[/b] [mention=5568595] \n\nThis news sparked an interesting conversation: what if cutting-edge AI like Grok could be leased for just a few cents?\nTurns out, if you're part of a U.S. government agency, that's not far from reality. Grok is reportedly being offered at just $0.42 per agency. The thread blends humor with real-world tech developments, making it one of this week's more thought-provoking reads.\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6308685]HF - Related Content & AI Curated Content[/url][/color][/size][/b][/u] - [b]by[/b] [mention=4931690]\n\nA proposal to evolve HackForums into a smarter, AI-powered content network has revealed that something has already been quietly built. The idea? Use LLMs to generate summaries, link related threads and replies, surface timeless content, and boost discoverability across both forums and blogs. The proposal also includes AI-generated blog posts and contextual replies in active threads. In a promising response, @Omnicient@ confirmed he already has an LLM ready - now it's just a matter of figuring out how best to implement it. This could be a huge leap for HF’s long-term usability and visibility. Got thoughts?

This section will grow over time to more things, but for now we are just going to be doing Song of the week. We are open to what more we could bring to the section from your suggestions, but as a start, we feel adding the song of the week will be a great start for the section and lead the way forward for more things in the future.\n\nNow we know some of you may question what the song of the week is all about, and we have thought of what a great answer. We feel like the song of the week should be a meaningful song that goes deeper than just general music and has meaning to it all. Granted, we may have a little fun with it sometimes. (Yes, we will have a Halloween version and Christmas version too.) But we want to keep it at a level where we have found the song has a true message behind it all and not just something that everyone will just see as another song that is just a bit catchy or got a good few beats to it. We hope this helps those with that question and if anyone has anything that they wish to ask, please feel free to add them below. We are more than happy to give the reason behind it.\n\nThis weeks Song Of The Week:\n[YouTube]https://youtu.be/V0rMY9WgtKE?si=pgSEst2i4epnknCN[/youtube]\n\n[hr]\n\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/contests.png[/img]\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=3929084]\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6305248]\n$100 USD (BTC) Contest || Celebrating My Acceptance in The Academy[/url] By [mention=4189082] [/color][/size][/b][/u]\n\nA new contest has been created this week by @W1NK1LL3RX@.
