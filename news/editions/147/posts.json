The short description on the official thread for now reads, \"A Lannister always pays his debts.\" By that this may be a marketing group, but we'll just have to wait and see. The group leaders are [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=#0066FF][b]Vinnie'[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1468706][color=#0066FF][b]Apple J4ck.[/b][/color][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=589027][color=#0066FF][b]Stay Plural[/b][/color][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]ShareCash Filter Lifted[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has unfiltered the often-dodged filter of ShareCash. You're now able to use the word \"ShareCash\" without having to modify it as many once did, often naming it \"ShitCash,\" \"$hareCash,\" or \"Sh@reCash.\" This should help people with discussion revolving around PPD, as ShareCash, although disliked by many, is a valid and reputable location for PPD use.\n\n[color=white][b]Official Group Legion is Recruiting[/b][/color]\nOfficial group Legion, founded by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url], is now recruiting.

For those who don't understand, this isn't for the official Mentor group; this is just a personal mentoring program for [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url] to lead. These are the members who [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47360][color=#00FF00][b]Saged[/b][/color][/url] picked for the first round: MuzzyHF, Vitafortis, Peter L, and Froggy.

Welcome to your HF News interview! Do you have any shout outs before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: Thanks for having me, Connected! I'd like to thank Hefto,  Daisy, Snorlax', Cody, Sir, Ramisme, Stay Plural Desiderius, mad, Pali, Yellows, Evangelist, Diabolic, Malichi, Tibit, and anyone else who's ever helped me!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] That's a big list. Hopefully they all read your interview! 😝 How did you find HF and why did you join?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: I found HF while researching WiFi exploitation! I was interested in many topics first glance, so I went ahead and joined!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] What are you up to these days on HackForums? I recommend the readers to check out [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JaSk-fxFA][i]this video[/i][/url] that Omni made in regard to Kray a year ago.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: I mainly spend my time on HF helping people, recently I may not of been as active because in the past four months I've lost nearly 90 lbs, and that actively requires a lot of dedication.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Good to know Eric! Anyways since you're so dedicated to weight loss, why not share some quick tips with the members of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: If you've tried normal excersise, and eating right, to no avail, I would HIGHLY recommend you looking into the Atkins/Low Carb (Keto) dieting structures. They work, and they're amazing 🙂!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] About your username \"Kray\". Does it have any special meaning?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: Naa! I was looking for a kewl username a few months back and with the help of Diabolic, and my old friend who had is account closed (Peek), I chose this one and it stuck. I prefer being called Eric, nonetheless.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] You joined back in 2012. Since then, many things have changed even though it's only been a year and a couple months. Please go ahead and name some changes that affected you and why.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: When I joined Crow was admin, I don't remember much of him though, he seems like a good guy. Biggest changes was my realization of some bullshit I was partaking in (Drama), I stopped coagulating, and haven't in months (6+). The addition of some staff, and removal of some, not really too big. A shit load of new groups, being sold and renamed. Things change, like LR getting shut down.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] What keeps you [i]connected[/i] to HackForums? (See what I did there? 😝 )\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: I stay with HF because its a good community where I can learn new things, and meet new people, and not die from boredom. Without HF & Reddit I don't know what I'd do at night.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Is there anything you dislike about Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: Some members are ridiculously pretentious, and that kind of attitude degrades many people's experiences on HF. Other than that, most is well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any set goals for your Hack Forums account? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: I have small goals, like maybe reaching 10k posts, but other than that my goal is to help people with whatever their goals may be.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for taking part in this interview, even though you left like twenty times. Any final words Mr. Eric?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][b]Kray[/b][/url]: I'd like to end our interview with a quote, \"That's the best revenge of all: happiness, Nothing drives people crazier than seeing someone have a good fucking life.\" -Chuck Palahniuk; never get to stirred over something petty. Thanks for having me!\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484]1n9i9c7om ツ[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Hello 1n9i9c7om! Welcome to the interview for the 147th edition of the HF News! Is there any people who will get a shout out from you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: Thanks! I would like to give a shoutout to Snorlax and Weekend. I'd also like to say thanks to the HF News for this interview.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Let's start with the question that has to be asked. What does your username mean?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: I knew that this question would come. It's a mix from my first name, \"Nico\", the first letter from my surname and my birth year, \"1997\".\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] You've joined a year ago, why exactly did you register in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: I joined HF because I searched a way to 'destroy' a minecraft server. I heard something about the 'Session Stealer', I searched for it and found Hackforums.\nI wasn't really active the first time after I registered, but after a time I decided to be active here. I don't regret this decision.\nHowever, I never tried to damage the server after I registered here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] You're in two official groups. How do you like the group experience? Is it different than just being a L33t or an Ub3r member?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: Well, I'd say it's different. A group is like another little community inside the forum.\nIt's different than just being L33t or Ub3r because you can have a subforum where you can speak with other members. And, for example, if you are in a group which is about coding, you can expect help from them if you have a coding section.\nThat's what I like - the little helpful community which groups are. It's much more important than just the userbar.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] What are your goals on Hack Forums? And what about your life goals?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: One of my goals in HF is helping members. But there is also one group which I'd love to be a part of. I don't think that I'll get an invite to it soon, but I'll just stay active in HF, and maybe, one day, I'll get an invitation.\nMy main goal in my real life is basically finding more friends. I changed school a while ago, so I lost contact to my friends there. However, I found some friends on the new school and I think it's better to have a few good friends than many wrong friends.\nAnother goal from my is getting a good job of course. I had a practicum in a company which develops software a few weeks ago, and I hope to get a job as a programmer in a few years.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Have your goals changed since you joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: Well yes, when I joined I didn't had any goals, until I decided to be active. After I bought L33t it was my goal to be qualified for Ub3r.\nWhen I was Ub3r, it was my goal to get in a usergroup. To be honest, I wanted to get into one because of the userbar first, but when I was invited into a group (it was beacon) I realized that it's not the userbar what makes a group special.\nMy real life goals haven't really changed since I joined, they are still the same.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Would you like to talk about things that you like and don't like about HF? A bit like some mini-feedback.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: Okay. I really like the community. HF has some really helpful and knowledgeable members. HF has an awesome community. However, there are some members which are only here to get free things in the \"Free Services and Giveaway\" section. I don't like it when members are trying to get free things and never contribute to the forum.\nA bad thing on HF is that some members think that you have to be an upgraded member to be a good member. In my opinion, you should respect regular members too as they can be skilled too. \nAll in all, I have to say, HF is a good place to discuss about various things and to meet nice people to talk with.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any hobbies you could share with us?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: Of course. I really like programing, I started with it around 2 years ago. I also really love playing Badminton. I started playing it around 1 year ago. Some people say I'm really good at it, but I personally think I still have to learn much.\nAnother hobby from me is gaming, preferably minecraft. I'm like a minecraft freak. I really love playing minecraft or setting up minecraft servers.\nThese things makes even more fun when I'm listing to music while I'm doing it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#80FF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url] It's great to know more about you Nico. Thanks for letting me interview you! Any final words to conclude this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1296484][b]1n9i9c7om ツ[/b][/url]: Yep. I'd like to say thanks for choosing me for this interview. I hope people know a bit more about me now. I woud also like to say thanks to the whole HF community, for the great time here. Have a nice day. 🙂\n[/spoiler]",

Below is a list of Xbox Exclusive Games.\n- Dead Rising 3\n- Forza Motorsport 5\n- Halo\n- Killer Instinct\n- Minecraft: Xbox ONE Edition\n- Quantum Break\n- Ryse: Son of Rome\n- Sunset Overdrive\nYou can view the full list of announced games here; [url=http://i.imgur.com/ZWK5YzZ.png](link)[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]New Xbox 360 Model Revealed, Free Games[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft announced a new model of the Xbox 360. It is smaller, quieter and sleeker than previous models. The new model is now available in the United States, UK, Canada and Australia. The 4GB model will be $199.99 while the 250GB model will price at $299.99. Along with this announcement, Microsoft said Xbox LIVE Gold Members will receive two free games per month. Fable 3 was recently made free on Xbox LIVE, with Halo 3 and Assassins Creed 2 becoming free sometime in July. Microsoft also announced that hundreds of games are still on the way for the Xbox 360.\n\n[color=white][b]Project Spark Announced[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft announced Project Spark, a new sandbox title for Xbox ONE and Windows 8. Project Spark allows anything to be created in-game, from environments, to characters and enemies. You can even create while playing. Creation can be assisted by Kinect or even Xbox SmartGlass, though it's not required. In the Project Spark demo during the Microsoft Media Briefing, it shows one player fighting against enemies, while the other is creating the environment to benefit the first player. It's a very new experience coming to Xbox ONE and Windows 8, however a release date has not been announced. \n\n[color=white][b]Xbox SmartGlass and Xbox LIVE[/b][/color]\nIt's clear that Xbox LIVE is a very good online service, but it gets even better! Xbox SmartGlass is natively built into Xbox ONE, allowing for more features and benefits. You can also view instant, realtime stat comparisons on Xbox SmartGlass. Microsoft also said that there are now 300,000 Xbox LIVE servers, which is a massive increase from 15,00 previously. \n\n[b][color=white]Xbox ONE DVR, Upload Studio and Twitch[/color][/b]\nXbox ONE will have an in-built DVR that allows gamers to record gameplay. The DVR will also be used for achievements, where you can see what you did to get a certain achievement and more. \"Upload Studio\" is a new feature where gameplay is automatically recorded using the Xbox ONE DVR feature - you can also add voice clips, effects and more. Live streaming is veyr popular... so Microsoft announced a partnership with Twitch. The Twitch service is built into Xbox ONE and allows gamers to stream straight from your console... no other accessories required. Both video and voice is recorded.\n\n[color=white][b]No More Microsoft Points on Xbox ONE, Friends List Limit Increased[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft are ruling out Microsoft Points and items will now be purchased using your local currency. You can now know exactly how much items are. During the Microsoft Press Conference, Marc Witton also confirmed that the friends list limit has been increased. However, Marc did not confirm the new limit, or if there is even a limit.\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox ONE Family Share Feature[/b][/color]\nAt first, the used games policy was pretty shady. However, Microsoft said that you can nominate ten people to be your \"family members\", where you can share your games with them via Xbox LIVE. You won't need to give them disks, it's all down on Xbox LIVE. So you can give your \"family\" access to your shared games library for the to play whenever... as long as no one else is playing it at the same time. “I think the policy makes sense,” Spencer says to Penny-Arcade. “It’s not ten different people all playing the game concurrently, but when you think about a real usage scenario, and we thought about it around a family, and I know certain people will create a family group of people that aren’t all part of the same family, and I do think that’s an advantage, and people will use that. I saw it on NeoGAF instantly, the Xbox Family creation threads, where people said 'Hey be a part of my family.'\"\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox ONE Launch Price[/b][/color]\nThe Xbox ONE will launch in 21 countries. Xbox ONE is priced at $499 in the US and $599 in Australia. An exact release date hasn't been announced, however it will launch in November 2013 with multiple launch titles and a special Day 1 achievement.\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ib2yd1FE9t6PUm.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]PlayStation Exclusive Games Shown @ E3[/b][/color]\nFive PS4 exclusives have been announced with 31 cross-platform titles. A number that is slightly lower than what Xbox announced at E3. Below is a list of PS Exclusive Games.\n- Driveclub\n- Infamous: Second Sun\n- Killzone: Shadow Fall\n- Knack\n- The Order 1886\nYou can view the full list of announced games here; [url=http://i.imgur.com/ZWK5YzZ.png](link)[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]PlayStation Plus Required Online Play[/b][/color]\nSony confirmed that gamers need to purchase PlayStation Plus to play games online. It's a system that has worked very well for Xbox, allowing Microsoft to provide better services and outbid for exclusives. Sony said that you can still play single player games without PS+, as well as use all media services. Current PS+ members will have their membership transfered over to the PS4. Sony announced that more Instant Game Collection titles will be available soon and include Don't Starve, Outlast, Secret Ponchos, and DriveClub PS Plus Edition. \n\n[color=white][b]PS4 Region Free[/b][/color]\nThe President of Sony Worldwide Studios, Shuhei Yoshida announced that the PS4 console will be region free. It was confirmed on twitter after the Sony Press Conference. A region free console allows gamers to  buy games from any region and play them on their console. Buying games from a different region is a very popular move, as you can buy games for much cheaper than in your own region. \n\n[color=white][b]No Restrictions[/b][/color]\nSony's press conference delivered many blows to Microsoft throughout the event. Sony made it clear that the PS4 will allow gamers to sell, trade and share PS4 games without restriction and that discs won't be checked by an online system. As an Xbox gamer, I thought their last blow was very funny. Sony introduced a video on how to share games with your friends. It showed how two people can share games in one step. It was a massive blow for Microsoft, however it was very funny.  \n\n[color=white][b]PS4 Launch Price[/b][/color]\nThe biggest knockout blow to Microsoft, was the price. Sony announced their new console will launch for $399 in the US and $549 in Australia. The console launches in the US for $100 less than the Xbox ONE, and $50 less in Australia.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jQ5EQ2ltjeK36.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Syria Denounces US' Chemical Weapons Claim[/b][/color]\nSyria has dismissed “a caravan of lies” that it, as a nation, ever used chemical weapons--after the United States said it would give the rebels “direct military aid.” President Obama made the decision after his administration concluded that Syrian forces had been using chemical weapons. However, Syria’s foreign ministry said the United States had used “fabricated information” on chemical weapons to justify the decision. In the two years of conflict, at least 93,000 people have been killed, said the United Nations on Thursday, at the current rate of 5,000 people per month. More than 1,700 children under the age of 10 have fallen throughout the battles, United Nations officials added.\n\n[color=white][b]Edward Snowden is “Banned from Flying to UK”[/b][/color]\nThe UK Government has warned airlines to not allow an ex-CIA employee, who is responsible for leaking secret US surveillance details, to fly in to the UK. A letter with Home Office letterhead was reported being sent to a Thai airport telling carriers to stop Edward Snowden, 29, from boarding any flights. It said, “if this individual attempts to travel to the UK: Carriers should deny boarding.” The letter went on to warn airlines they may “be liable to costs relating to the individual’s detention and removal” if they are to allow him to travel. A charge for such a situation would be £2,000 ($3,130). All of this is only precautionary, as there is no suggestion that he has any intention to travel to the UK. Mr. Snowden’s actions have a divided opinion in the United States; some call him a hero and others are calling for him to be tried for treason.\n\n[color=white][b]Two People Killed by Colorado Springs Wildfire[/b][/color]\nThe most destructive wildfire in the history of Colorado has killed two people. Their bodies were recovered from the Black Forest area, where the fire has destroyed nearly 380 homes since it started Tuesday. Approximately 39,000 people have left their homes amid what authorities describe as the \"most destructive wildfire in the history of Colorado.\" The fire has burned 3,150 acres and was 40% contained on Friday. “I never, in my wildest dreams, imagined we’d be dealing a year later with a very similar circumstance.” Sheriff Maketa said.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbirdFfeOijxAv.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Google Loon Balloons![/b][/color]\nGoogle's \"Project Loon\" is definitely something a little out of the ordinary. It's a plan they've had for a while that has finally come out to the public. Whether you think it's cool, loony or just outright stupid, you can't deny that it's awesome. Google is launching huge (15m/50ft in diameter!), super-pressure balloons into the edge of our atmosphere to provide internet down below. The majority of the world right now is without internet; this will help with communication, especially in times of natural disaster and will definitely help the world be more connected. \n\nEach balloon will last around 100 days and \"orbit\" the Earth in an easterly direction. Each balloon with internet connectivity to an area of 40km below. Google says speeds will be around the same as 3G, if not faster.\n\n\"The idea behind Loon was that it might be easier to tie the world together by using what it has in common - the skies - than the process of laying fibre and trying to put up cellphone infrastructure\" said Richard DeVaul, Google chief technical architect.  \n\nYou can read more about this awesome project and track its progress [url=http://www.google.com/loon]here[/url]. What do you guys think of this project? A bit too \"out there\"? Or totally innovative? I, personally, think it's great seeing such a big company doing something not to maximise profits, but to actually bring the human race closer together and provide a huge aid when communication is critical.\n\n[color=white][b]Facebook and Twitter[/b][/color]\nHashtags have been around for quite a while. Since the birth of Twitter, people have been hashtagging their lives; ironically or not. Facebook has now finally added support for them! They have said it will offer a \"larger view of what's happening\" - this would definitely help with ad sales, providing a sort of platform for \"real time marketing\". A missing feature finally added or just another way to boost revenue: what do you think?\n\nTwitter has boasted about keeping its users' information private with all of this NSA/PRISMA stuff that's been happening, but they will now have to reveal the names of users posting racist tweets after after a court case dating back to October 2012. Anti-semitic comments were made and a French judge ruled that Twitter must hand over the requested data. \"Twitter has not made any progress in regards to respecting our country's laws\" said John Hayoun, president of UEJF (Union des étudiants juifs de France [Union of French Jewish students]).\n\n[color=white][b]Facebook Reveals Information on NSA Data Requests[/b][/color]\nFacebook has announced that they had received between 9000 to 10000 requests for user data from the NSA in the second half of 2012 alone. Multiple huge companies such as Google and Microsoft have allowed the US government direct access to sensitive user information under a data collection programme we've all heard of by now. PRISM. Is this an invasion of privacy? Maybe, but there are so many different arguments for and against it. Facebook said in a recent blog post, reassuring its users, that this is a tiny fraction of the company's huge userbase; under 1% of their 1.1 billion active users.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jsSqf056c30Ww.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Kanye West and Jay-Z Will Reunite as the Throne 'Eventually'[/b][/color]\nJay-Z and Kanye West have recently started contacting each other again about putting out a second Throne album. The first Watch the Throne album dropped in 2011. As of now, Jay-Z has not released an album since four years ago when he recorded his last solo LP, The Blueprint 3. Mike Dean, the co-producer of their 2011 album, has confirmed that there will be a 'Watch The Throne 2' LP in the future.\nJay-Z stated late last year that a second release may come out at some point. Both rappers are currently working on their own albums, but when they're free they'll start collaborating with each other, and get started on the album.\n\n[color=white][b]Ariana Grande, Mac Miller 'Make Music All The Time'[/b][/color]\nFor all the fans following the two, they would know that they have a small thing for each other. Although they are not dating, Ariana and Mac's affairs have recently brought them even closer together. The two are now talking about how they produce music together and how they sound lovely in harmony. The latest song the two made, The Way, is currently a hit for both Mac Miller and Ariana Grande fans. Mac constantly tells everyone how he has seen amazing women singers, but not as amazing as Ariana. He hinted that they might be releasing new songs sometime soon. He said, \"So we did a bunch of records and we're gonna do more. Um... I don't know if they're gonna make it on this album or it's the next one or whatever it is, but we just make music all the time. That's my homey.\" The two definitely have some chemistry together considering how long they've been friends. Currently, \"The Way\" is the lead single off the \"Sam & Cat\" star's August album, Daydreamin'. There's even more to come from her, so fans are going to be anxious with 'The Way' she can win hearts!\n\n[color=white][b]Katy Perry Can't Choose Her Man[/b][/color]\nKaty Perry is currently having a \"tough\"  time choosing the man she wants to be with. She's having an on-and-off relationship with male singer, John Mayer and has also had a thing for Robert Pattinson after he broke up with Kristen Stewart a few months ago. Out of the two, she has had a stronger bond with Robert than anyone else; this includes John Mayer. As of now, she's falling for Rob, but John's got the chemistry that is keeping their friendship together and them keeping it strong between the two. Katy and John dated last summer.  They broke up not too long ago, March of this year, to be exact. Overtime, they broke up because Katy felt like John didn't give her enough attention. He was constantly checking out someone else, and she didn't like that. She's caught up with two men right now, and her career will pay the price if she chooses the wrong man. A source stated that \"She still feels she's got great chemistry with John, he has been over to her house twice in the past week. She has broken up with him numerous times in the past because he refuses to commit and stop seeing other girls, but, then a few weeks later, she ends up back in his arms - she says it's because they have this crazy connection.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jj0OFp0aBuwTS.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI would like to take this moment to personally thank [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][b]Retribute[/b][/url] for the multitudes of the work he puts into the HF News.

I woke up and got on HF. \nI saw the thread and participated in a giveaway for Goodwill Monday. \nA good start. I then repped a few HQ members I felt were deserving. \nBy now it was like noon. I ate some lunch and played a little Xbox, all \nwhile browsing HF. At about 2:30, I got a call from a buddy of mine \nasking me to umpire two little league baseball games later that night. \nThey started at 5:30 so I had to rush into the shower and to the \nGoodwill store to get some cheap umpire colored slacks. I can home \nto pick up my brother who was playing in those games and got to \nworking. It wasn't that bad. When I got done, I was paid $70 and \nthen I went home and died on my bed.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][i]-H²O™[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Good will Monday was rather exiting. I bought pizza for \na few members and I gave out jolly reps to members who were doing \ngood. Overall the day went rather well, it was great seeing everyone \non HF stopping the general bickering for a day to be able to all happily \nhold hands.

Then i went out for lunch with a few friends \nand then i went home and went on HF again and gave out a few reps \nbecause it was good will Monday after posting and watching a few The \nSimpsons episodes... I decide to snuggle with Vitani for a little while. \n(She is my 9 foot inflatable lioness) after that... I went on HF some \nmore and checked out a few other sites in the process and then i went \nto bed to watch TV and to snuggle with Vitani again and for the spirit \nof Good Will Monday... I fucked Vitani...

She was like \"That reminds me, you \nneed new shorts.\" So, from me reading and telling me mom that, the \nday ended up being a stupid shopping day where we went from store \nto store.
