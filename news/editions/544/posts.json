If you have never heard of Hack Forum News, dont worry we have you covered. We are a team of members from the Hack Forums community who are journilists and writers, and we are here to keep you in the loop of the changes around the site and now even around the world.[/b]\n\n[hr]\n\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/headlines.png[/img]\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=121196]\n\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6302553][color=#ffffff]Moving Forward And Recent Events[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\nOmniscient announces recent changes to HackForums, including the removal of some long-time members, as part of a new direction for the community. The aim is to create a more visionary, productive space, even if that means upsetting some people along the way. Omniscient acknowledges that change can be uncomfortable but believes it's necessary for real progress. Remaining members are encouraged to contribute ideas, skills, and passion to help shape HF’s future.\n\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6302361][color=#ffffff]Userbars Aliens vs Cosmic[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\nLast week, we reported on Omniscient updating the userbars on HackForums. This week, the evolution continues as Omniscient has launched a community poll to decide between two fresh userbar themes - Aliens and Cosmics. So far, the Aliens design appears to be the favorite among voters, but the final result is still to be determined.\n\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6302843][color=#ffffff]Group Convo Rooms[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\nOmniscient is currently working on converting Group Convo Rooms (GCRs) to function more like the old Public Convo Room (PCR), including displaying only the latest 20 messages for context instead of storing full chat logs. Due to database limitations, notifications won't be implemented. The focus is instead on bringing back fun features like /flip and /rain. Omniscient also warns that Socket-based features (Convos and Notices) may be unstable during development.\n\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6299864][color=#ffffff]Hack Forums News - Weekly Reports[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=2331053]\nAs always, we appreciate the community’s contributions to the HackForums News by submitting reports you believe are newsworthy.

RCE exploits are still a problem, and it's not an overnight fix. Here are some recommended tips for dealing with this situation.\n\nStop playing immediately: Do not launch or play any online modes for Call of Duty games listed on your PC. Do not assume you are safe in private matches.\nAwait official confirmation: The only safe source of information is from the official Call of Duty or Activision social media channels and their support websites. Do not trust rumors or unofficial sources.\nDo not download unofficial fixes: Be extremely cautious of any third-party downloads claiming to be a \"patch\" or a \"fix\" for this exploit. These are very likely to be malware themselves. Only install updates directly through Battle.net or Steam.\nCheck your system: While there is no evidence of widespread attacks yet, it is good practice to run a full antivirus scan on your computer if you have played any of these games in the last few days.\n\n\n\n[list]\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)\n[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\n[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops II\n[*]Call of Duty: Ghosts\n[*]Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered (on official servers)\n[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops III (A patch was released in 2023 by Treyarch.
