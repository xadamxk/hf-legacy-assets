Any shout outs you want to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] Yes; I want to give a shout out to one of the greatest members here on HF which is, James (Realizm), Hydra, Prada, and all the titans members. Also a quick shout out to my friend Unreal.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Alright then. Let's start off this interview on the topic of groups. What do you think about the groups as of right now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] The groups, basically the groups are very differently on how I see them. I'm going to talk about the groups I've been in, and those I know about. I'm going to start with Titans, Titans is a very great group filled with talented and nice members, each member has his own quality and the group serves purpose, the group is led by 3 very nice leaders and the group is going well, inside and outside the Subforum. The next group is Echo, Echo started off as a stress testing group, I think. Now it has turned into a general lounge group, the reason is; it didn't get enough interest nor where many people experienced in that field. It's still a great group after its change of purpose; the group in general is very chill, all the members are nice, especially the leaders. The fun part, is that all the echo members has one or more projects or products. Let's talk about l 'appel du vide, l 'appel du vide, is in my opinion a group where you can discuss several subjects and discuss it with people that has knowledge, a lot of interesting topics are coming up in the Subforum. The members in general are nice. Zero; I recently joined Zero, because it shares the same interests as me, and that is Marketing and Business, the group is filled with people who knows what they're doing and whatnot. The recent changes of leaders has been nice too, seeing Melty as a leader is great. Junior is also a good leader of Zero, and he has some good marketing skills. The recent recruitment isn't the best thing that has happened to Zero, almost everyone can join for $50 now, therefore it may increase the quality of the group; I'm not really sure. Going forward to the one and only Fortune, I would say it has the most hated leader on HF and it's a bad group, but that's not true at all; the group was filled with nice members, the leaders were great, I saw potential in the group when I was going to take leadership in Forune, everything was going as planned, until people started to act a bit unprofessional in my opinion, and Leaders started to Blacklist Fortune members from their group. Basically Fortune was a bit of a failure as I see it, but PE is starting to make better decisions by rebranding the group. Yeah that's what I have to say about the groups on HF. Before I end this subject I really want to give a shout out to Specialists, Bull and killamuvz are both nice leaders, they have a group filled with specialists in different subjects and it just fulfills the purpose of the group. A big thanks to all the help that group has given.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting feedback. What groups (current and old) would you consider to be your favorite and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] Titans, definitely my favorite group. First of all, that's the first group that I joined, second, the leaders are just fantastic people, they are very active unlike other leaders, all the members are very nice and acting kind to each other. The sub forum is filled with great content, also, Titans is planning some few events later this year, which I hope everyone can loon forward to. Titans is just basically like a Brotherhood to be honest, clear and simple.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Ah I see. Is Titans your only favorite group? What about the rest? Any former groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] I'm very new to the rest, so sorry if I don't have too much constructive feedback about them, but if I was to Join Specialists or got accepted that would probably be a favorite too, because the purpose of the group falls under my interests; so does Zero. Void and Echo, is just lounge groups as I like to call them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] No worries. You were a former leader of Fortune, is that correct? Can you tell us some of the things you did?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] So basically I was invited to be a sector leader. Then after some chats with PE he made me a leader; as the nice guy he is. We made a skype group and started to plan future projects. We did everything right. I was just about to close the recruitment for my sector. I already had a few members in the sector and we were going to make threads with GFX related stuff. The only thing stopping this process was all the hate against PE and the group. I had to step of as a leader or get kicked from a majority of the groups I was in, in the process of stepping off as a leader, I got a \"7 day ban\" from Echo, I didn't understand that, but it's fine. Being a leader was extraordinary and made me think about purchasing Polymath. But I don't have the time and effort to start a new group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] It's good to have experiences. I believe Fortune is being revamped into \"Vibe\". What do you think about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] I don't have much thoughts about that, I'm not interested at all actually. I will look into the GFX request they have though, and I'll see if I can pull of a nice userbar, I'll do it for free of course. I'm also currently making Zed an userbar.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] You are? I assume you have experiences in GFX then?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do have experience in GFX.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What got you started in GFX? What made you interested in it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] Ehm; I started GFX long time ago, it started as an hobby, I've always been a person who sits on the computer a lot. So I installed photoshop one day because someone requested a logo, and I made them a logo, but it was literally the shittiest logo I've ever seen. So they told me it wasn't good looking, and I was working hard everyday to make something cool, and after watching on tutorials for days, I started to get used to the software and mechanism and basically everything was much easier once I learnt the software. So after a few years now, photoshop had become a hobby and I can almost create anything I want by request. Later on I started doing 3D designs, it started off by making 3D letters and 3D intros to youtube channels, and the  later it became designing of interior,  exterior and pretty much everything. Then I got interested in something called motion graphics. I started working with After effects and started making flat 2d intros, I have now created over 300 signatures for members here on HF. I really enjoy making GFX, but keep in mind,  it's just a hobby of mine.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Have you ever thought of monetizing your hobby? Making yourself a GFX service?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] I already have a GFX service, I had to close it for some reasons, some of them is I didn't have time; I was making everything for $2 so it isn't really worth my time. Ehm otherwise I have made a few free services related to GFX. Off site I've done a lot of work for professional companies which I get paid a lot for. Besides GFX I'm also a web developer and I do website designs top,  that's really it; I have thought about making a service again, but I'm not sure.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Charging a bit more might help. You're also a web developer? Interesting, what skills do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] I have 2 years of experience as of right now; with experience I am talking about since the day I actually started to make websites for real. I started coding 5 years ago. My skills are pretty much above average and average to right now; nothing special really. It's like knowing languages, and I'm pretty good with languages. All right on topic again, web development. So I've been making websites for my own projects and practice purposes and I've made some for companies. I've made a couple of thousands now in 2015 by making websites.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Do you plan on learning anything else? Enhancing or acquiring new skills?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I'm looking to improve and learn some few new coding languages. Besides that I'm studying for law school, I'm a pretty busy student, so I don't have time to learn new things, I had more time in my hands when I was a kid compared to now. I'm planning on teaching myself to speak Russian fluently also write. Anything else would be related to school.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Like they say, knowledge is power. Do you think education is important?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] Education for me is very important. I've always had a passion to be a lawyer, and education gives you the chance to be one.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I hope you reach that goal of yours one day. Thanks for your time +One! Anything else you want to say before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2231695][color=white][b]+One:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to thank you for spending time and showing interest in what I do. Thanks.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

I think it would stop people from spamming Omniscient with PMs for when they donate for an award and don't receive it right away. Cameron already took advantage of it and gifted Omniscient the Brony award which was added to his profile right away. I can see this being useful for people who do contests that involves giving away an award. Or if they want to donate to HF and receive an award themselves right away without having to wait.\"[/align]\r\n\r\n[align=left][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2072010]Λaron[/url][/b]\r\n\"I think it's a clean and effective way for members to purchase awards. It completely eliminates the need for /cryptocoin.php and will lessen Omni's work load because he won't be recieving so many PM's.\"\r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[align=right][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2195187]24k[/url][/b]\r\n\"I think it's great. It will help staff focus more on other things. However it takes away the unique message when you buy a award, like have a nice weekend or something.\"\r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[align=left][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2177496]boxxy[/url][/b]\r\n\"I personally liked PM'ing Omni, and having him do it manually, it just feels better that way. But, on the other hand this is going to save him a lot of time as well, so he can work on new updates. I think now you can buy other users awards without their consent now, which is pretty cool.\"\r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/l55r4R7.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\nNothing new from the HF News Team. :)\r\n\r\n[color=transparent] [/color]",

The vulnerability allows any malicious online shopper to purchase anything on the site for free, as well as introduces the possibility of compromising credit cards. One of the scariest things about this attack is that it is in the very core of Magento, not caused by any particular plugin or theme, and is therefore exploitable in any default installation, Community or Enterprise. The vulnerability is triggered by an attacker injecting code into an RCE-vulnerable page, allowing them to use custom discount coupon codes that give you 100% off of any product. Rubin showed off his new attack by demonstrating how one can purchase a $100,000 watch for free in a Magento-powered online store. An analysis of the attack by Rubin himself can be found in the source below.

Since Fiber Optics have come about, a technology that transfers data via photons of light as opposed to electrical impulses through copper wire, there have been ways to intercept this traffic without letting the source or destination know. A translucent mirror at a 45 degree angle will reflect the light to another area as well as allow it to go straight through, allowing attackers to see copies of data as well as respond as if they were the original target. This can allow them to send malicious payloads to users without their knowledge. Though it is impossible to detect someone passively listening, a group of tools have been released to detect when someone is using a Quantum Inserting attack to send you a response as if it were from someone else. The tool detects packets with the same sequence numbers but with different data sizes. Though these tools are far from perfect, they show that the American people are worried about sophisticated attacks perpetrated by the NSA.

The extensions saves an encrypted version of a users password and warns users with a popup if they enter that password on a site without a Google login page. However, within a day of releasing the new feature security researcher Paul Moore developed a way to bypass it. Moore came up with a few lines of JavaScript code that deletes the alert element. It runs every 5ms, so technically the alert is there, but one would never see it. Google has since fixed the first workaround Moore found, however, Moore has found a second work around he thinks will be very, very difficult to patch. To prevent Moore's original bypass from working, Google changed the handler of the alert from the DOM to the UA. However, Moore has discovered that by reloading the page after each character is entered, Google's extension no longer recognizes that the password is being entered. Moore developed the technique in under twenty minutes and says he can't think of an easy to resolve the issue. Google says they'll work to make whatever fixes are necessary.

Mozilla said that this would be phased out in two steps. The first of which would prevent any new Firefox features after a specific date from being used by non-HTTPS sites. The stage would encompass limiting existing features from being used by non-HTTPS sites. It's not clear at this point what a new feature is, so Mozilla is working with it's developer community to come up with a reasonable definition. Firefox already prevents non-HTTPS sites from receiving persistent permission to use the microphone and camera. Mozilla isn't the first major player to make a step towards using only secure connections. Last year Google announced that it will increase the rankings of sites that use HTTPS and earlier this month, Google announced it will force its ad service to use HTTPS.

The new version of the trojan checks how many CPU cores the system has, and if it has only one, the trojan terminates. Researchers tested eight unnamed sandboxes, four commercial and four publicly available and all eight failed to detect the Trojan that ran. The researchers also discovered another evasive technique used by the trojan. The trojan now uses a new user agent which aides the trojan in bypassing signature based detection. The researches said there there were also some minor changes made to further prevent signature based detection.

One such instance of this is with the listing of [i]Black Ops 3[/i] as available on both the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360, the now-outdated consoles of Sony and Microsoft, respectively. This news arrives in stark contrast of everything consumers have been shown regarding the game, with almost all footage and gameplay seen coming from either PC or a current-gen console. The listing of the game’s future availability on last-gen consoles was made by Dutch retailer “BOT,” with snapshots of the game’s cover art on the old Xbox 360 box-cover design. Neither Treyarch nor Activision have denied that the game will be released on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, but further news is expected in light of this new revelation by BOT. \r\n[b]*UPDATE*[/b] It was later confirmed by Mashable that the game would only be available on current-gen consoles and PC. \r\n[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.gamepur.com/news/18700-retailer-lists-call-duty-black-ops-iii-ps3-and-xbox-360-high-moon-studios.html]>>Source 1[/url][/size][/i]\r\n[i][size=x-small][url=http://thegamingrpt.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-only-coming-to-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc]>>Source 2[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Future [i]Silent Hills[/i] Game Officially Cancelled[/color][/b]\r\nThe recently announced [i]Silent Hills[/i] game by Konami has officially been cancelled. The cancellation of the game was announced via twitter by famous film director Guillermo del Toro, who was working on the game alongside Hideo Kojima. This cancellation comes in the wake of Hideo Kojima’s release from Konami. Konami gave this official word to gaming publication [url=http://kotaku.com/its-official-silent-hills-is-cancelled-1700379816]Kotaku[/url]regarding the game’s cancellation: “Konami is committed to new Silent Hill titles, however the embryonic ‘Silent Hills’ project developed with Guillermo del Toro and featuring the likeness of Norman Reedus will not be continued. In terms of Kojima and Del Toro being involved, discussions on future Silent Hill projects are currently underway, and please stay tuned for further announcements.” The [i]Silent Hills[/i] P.T. will be removed from the Playstation Network later this week, hammering the last nail into the game’s coffin.

For her entire life before and during her game development career she dealt with issues such as low self-esteem and chronic pain. These problems became more and more prevalent as she gained a deeper hold in the game development industry, with verbal abuse from gamers being a common occurrence for her. A few weeks before her suicide, she’d made statements saying she would be leaving multiple online communities due to the abuse that she fell victim to. It was on April 23rd that that she jumped off of the Washington Bridge in New York. Her most outspoken mourners are those who worked with her on the Dolphin emulator, a Wii and Gamecube emulator program. The Dolphin emulator blog had this to say about her suicide: “She was a very kind and helpful person, one of many to help guide me through the project when I first started to contribute to the program. Her contributions to both the TAS and Dolphin Emulator community were vast, adding multiple helpful and sorely needed tools to make Dolphin easier to TAS. Although I did not know her as long as the others, I know she will surely be missed by all of those who knew her.” [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.geeksnack.com/2015/04/28/developer-rachel-byrk-commits-suicide-months-cyber-bullying/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n[/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Br6N715.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=left]\r\n[b][color=white]A True Competitor - LG G4 Smartphone Unveiled[/color][/b]\r\nWith tech giants like Samsung and HTC releasing their flagship devices not too long ago, LG has unveiled a flagship of their own this week: the LG G4. According to LG, the device will have 5.5 inch, QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) display, as well as a whopping 16 megapixel camera. Unlike its rivals, the Galaxy S6 and HTC One M9, the G4 will be the only one of the three to have expandable storage and a removable backing. It will also be the first smartphone to don the new powerhouse that is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 Processor. The G4 is set to release on April 29 in Korea, while other worldwide release dates have yet to be announced.

This week, Microsoft revealed their plan to allow developers to directly port their apps right into Windows with little changes, and even incorporate Windows 10 features into the apps, such as Cortana and Live Tiles. This will be made possible by a handful of software development kits they have introduced for the project. \"We want to structure the platform so it’s not an all or nothing,\" said Terry Myerson, VP of Microsoft OS Development. According to Myerson, the development team considered only porting iOS, but decided on porting both iOS and Android to capture all mobile platforms.

Before other major streaming services such as Spotify, Grooveshark has been playing content for almost a decade with it's radio style music player. The site's demise comes as a result of multiple licensing lawsuits over the course of the site's lifespan, including a $17 billion lawsuit. As part of a settlement with a group of major record labels, those at Grooveshark have wiped servers clear, handed over their own copyrights and patents, and even handed over ownership of the website.
