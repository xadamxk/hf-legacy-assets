We can say that Britain is going to have little choice now but to cozy up to the U.S. Chairman Donald Trump.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/brexit-supporter-burns-eu-flag-near-downing-street-in-london] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Panic spreads over protection against coronavirus[/color][/b]\r\nCoronavirus may be transmitted from individual to individual, despite the fact that it isn't clear how easily.\r\nMany of the reports included individuals who were at the focal point of the flare-up, family members of those infected, or medical workers in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Transmission is likely to occur by interaction with an infected person by coughing or sneezing particles in the air, or by someone exposing himself to an infected individual or item contaminated with the virus and then rubbing their eyes, mouth or nose. Situations which are best advised to wear a mask for are when you're in a crowd, or when you're caring for the sick. However, those who should wear a mask are mainly infected individuals.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-masks-safety/to-mask-or-not-to-mask-confusion-spreads-over-coronavirus-protection-idUSKBN1ZU0PH] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Aggression of Brexit supporters towards the EU[/color][/b]\r\nSupporters of Brexit set on flames a European Union flag near \"Downing Street,\" while other supporters mocked the European Union representatives in the final hours of Brexit. A big group of European Union supporters were also ridiculed by an even larger group of Brexiteers nearby who were saying their last goodbyes to the European Union. The most important factor is that the EU is about to lose a big percentage of its economy, abоut 15%. In addition to also lоsing the world's financial capital - London. England must start graphing a path for a long time into the future.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/brexit-supporter-burns-eu-flag-near-downing-street-in-london] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]    [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://www.hackforums.news/assets/v4/technews-invisible.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Help from Jellyfish[/color][/b]\r\nJellyfish are getting an upgrade at the California Institute of Technology, thanks to researches. They have developed a prosthetic that can be applied to a jellyfish, which will help them swim faster around them than most jellyfish. “The new prosthetic uses electrical impulses to regulate – and speed up – that pulsing, similar to the way a cardiac pacemaker regulates heart rate.” The main reason behind this work is that the jellyfish will bring sensors to the ocean depths that we have not yet reached. This will assist scientists in measuring ocean temperatures, levels of oxygen, and many other technical details. It should be noted that this prosthetic does not in any way damage the jellyfish, even when the device is removed from them.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnet.com/news/scientists-create-cyborg-jellyfish-with-swimming-superpowers/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Coronavirus striking again[/color][/b]\r\nTesla's Gigafactory, which began production of the Model 3 in Shanghai in 2018 and recently began delivering the first cars, is to remain shut down until February 9 due to the recent coronavirus outbreak. This brief shutdown is not expected to have a major impact on Model 3 production, but for the first quarter of 2020, it will have a small impact on profit. This Gigafactory has played an important role in China as Tesla is increasingly trying to grow their market even more, with China being the \"largest electric vehicle market.\" The coronavirus affects not only people but also some big companies that rely on being available.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114377/tesla-coronavirus-delay-production-factory-china] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Facebook - $550 million class action lawsuit[/color][/b]\r\nSome Illinois users will be receiving a payout from Facebook for a breach of privacy. A class-action lawsuit was brought to court with Facebook's use of facial recognition technology. Illinois is only one of two states to allow facial recognition to be used for commercial purposes. It involves gathering biometric data from users, which would be used to develop and deploy new features in the future. This has been “the largest cash settlement ever to resolve a privacy related lawsuit.” This is a major step for users, as biometric data processing has increased rapidly.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/29/facial-recognition-lawsuit-facebook-paying-550-million/4615655002/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/gamingnews-redsox.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]How your Gaming Footprint Effects us all[/color][/b]\r\nAre the gamer's hurting us and killing the environment? No one runs through the sequence of events that have to happen in order for you to boot up and play the desired game you've been looking forward to all day. Multiple studies have been done over the last 10-12 years, and the amount of data we consume and upload are quite frankly off the charts. According to Mills' study, he found that PC-based cloud gaming requires about 500W of power during gameplay. \"This is far more than most local desktop or laptop gaming rigs,\" he notes. Mills also states that from 2020 on, data centers are expected to consume three times as much energy.

It seems since YouTube's launch of YouTube Gaming, the company has been perusing many big names in the streaming game to jump ship and stream on their platform possibly. \"I want users to feel like when they come into YouTube that we've got all the gaming video content that they're looking for,\" said Ryan Wyatt, global head of gaming at YouTube.\" Microsoft made out like bandits signing Ninja to an exclusive deal to only broadcast on their platform (Mixer).  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/26/tech/video-game-streaming-wars/index.html]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Developers Look Ahead to PS5[/color][/b]\r\nNo surprise that the console wars have been going on since the dawn of time. Usually, people will pick a company they believe in and want to give their hard-earned money to without hesitation. Most of the console wars happen outside of the studios and developer offices, but it sounds like we have an in house war going on now. With Xbox and Playstation set to release new consoles this coming Holiday, GDC did a poll, and the results were baffling. \"Just 9% of developers are currently making games for the Xbox Series X (listed in the survey as the Xbox Scarlett) compared to 11% of respondents making games for PlayStation. To put that in context, 39% of developers asked were making mobile games, while 56% were making PC titles. It's helpful to underline that developers could be making cross-platform titles or working on multiple projects, so the numbers are indicative at best.\"  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.t3.com/news/ps5-news-developers-are-more-interested-in-playstation-5-than-xbox-series-x]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color][/size][/font]",
