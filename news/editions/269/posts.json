Between 2000-2010 Adobe Flash was prevalent on almost every site, but as it became more popular so did exploits for it. With flash along with java being responsible for an estimated 80% of infections during 2012, it was long past due that Adobe finally killed Flash and helped to stop the spread of malware. Starting next year Flash will not longer be made, instead being replaced with a more secure product called Animate CC. Adobe has said they will still continue making security patches, and providing legacy support for Flash during the next few years do to its still, wide spread use.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/crypto-reuse-connected-devices/][color=#FFFFFF][b]Millions Vulnerable To Man In The Middle Attacks[/b][/color][/url]\r\nIn a recent security audit by SEC Consult it was found that thousands of devices shared the same SHH keys, with an estimated 15% of private keys being vulnerable. Several large manufactures  have taken a single SSH key and baked it into their devices firmware (mostly routers, modems and communication devices), which means that thousands of devices use the same key. This is an issue because, it lets hackers initiate a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack allowing data to be stolen, and potentially more malicious attacks in the future. As an example one manufacturer's router using the same key, allows 6.1 million devices to be open to remote administration. Vendors are being urged to start using random generated keys, and issue patches to correct the issue, however given the scope and devices effected it does not look like this will be patched anytime soon.\r\n\r\n[url=https://threatpost.com/data-on-5-million-users-compromised-in-breach-at-toy-maker-vtech/115495/ ][color=#FFFFFF][b]5 Millions Users' Data Stolen[/b][/color][/url]\r\nVTech announced last week that 5 million customers data was stolen from their database, most troubling is that this data contained thousands of kids pictures. VTech which makes educational toys for kids, has said that personally identifiable information such as addresses, names and even voice recordings where taken, over 190 gigabytes of information in total. More troublesome is that their most popular tablet for kids \"Innotab\" has been to be helplessly insecure. The researchers have discovered that a dump data partition and removable memory card can allow hackers to access sensitive data on the tablets, along with the possibility of making them into spying devices. VTech has been aware of this issue for around two years and still made no effort to correct it in newer versions of the tablet.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/HackingNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Wires.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2015/11/hilton-payment-system-attacked.html][b][color=white]Hilton Hotel Franchise Hacked[/color][/b][/url]\r\nEarlier this year, crafty malware found its way into Hilton Hotel's payment system. The purpose of the malware was to steal credit card information - unfortunately, the attempt to cause distress was successful. While Hilton Hotel urges its customers to track their activity for anything strange, it has also been announced that the malware could of retrieved a person's name as shown on their card, account number, security code and expiry date. Similarly, this malware had been used in numerous hotels previously, resulting in the leak of mass credit card information. Trump Hotel, also victim of this malware said \"We believe that there may have been unauthorised malware access to some of the computers that host our front desk terminals and payment card terminals in our restaurants, gift shops and other point-of-sale purchase locations at some hotels.\" \r\n\r\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/12/ransomware-hacking-password_3.html][b][color=white]Ransomware Moves Quickly to Steal Passwords[/color][/b][/url]\r\nA new dangerous ransomware dubbed \"Angler\", may just be the new generation's worst exploit kit yet. This is a threat to a person's PC as all they would have to do is visit an untrustworthy website. Angler looks for vulnerable applications within the PC, and then goes ahead and injects data which can be used to steal login usernames and passwords - otherwise known as \"Pony\". It does not stop there. The second phase of Angler encrypts a person's files until the given ransom is paid. This type of ransomware is often spread via email, so as always exercise caution when clicking any suspicious links.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2015/12/chinese-cybercriminal-gang-uses-dropbox.html][b][color=white]Dropbox Being Used in an Attempt to Target Media Outlets[/color][/b][/url]\r\nA Chinese group of hackers known as \"A Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat\" (APT), have made themselves known for being responsible for attacks against the foreign governments. It is also believed that the group has previously attacked financial services and telecommunication services. The group uses Dropbox to hold and contain information retrieved unwillingly from people. Early January 2013, the group also allegedly targeted the New York Times with the intent to retrieve information regarding a scandal involving Wen Jiabao. The Chinese former premier is believed to of hidden a fortune within the walls of China.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35006404][b][color=white]Mass Shooting in San Bernardino, California[/color][/b][/url]\r\nFourteen people are dead after a shooting in San Bernardino, California last Wednesday. The two shooters were Tashfeen Malik, and her husband Syed Rizwan Farook. The couple entered the Inland Regional Center, which was host to a Christmas party for San Bernardino public health department employees, and began to open fire. Farook had been an employee of the county public health department for five years. While there is not yet any solid proof of ties to radicalism, or the Islamic State, the event is now being investigated as an act of terrorism. There has been some speculation that the couple were inspired by foreign terror groups, including an old Facebook post by Malik, in support of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The post has been removed. While evidence supports that the two planned the attack well in advance, there is still no evidence of involvement in a larger terror network.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/world/gollum-smeagol-peter-jackson-turkey-erdogan/index.html][b][color=white]Turkish Man Could Face Prison For Smeagol Meme[/color][/b][/url]\r\nA prison sentence could be in store for Dr. Bilgin Ciftci after he posted memes comparing the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the Lord of the Rings character Gollum. In Turkey, it is a crime to insult the head of state, and the 47 year old father of two could be facing two years in prison if he is convicted. Strangely enough, the outcome of the case could depend on whether a Turkish court finds that the character comparison is truly offensive. Even the Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has come to the defense of Ciftci. Jackson said that the images depicted the fictional character alter ego Smeagol, the kind and lovable side of the evil Gollum. Dr. Ciftci's lawyer has said that she will include Jackson's statements in the defense file. There has even been an outside expert called in to analyze the character of Gollum, as the judge in this case is not familiar with the films or books.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/sports/soccer/judge-in-fifa-scandal-arrested-when-cruise-ship-docks-in-florida.html?ref=world][b][color=white]Judge in FIFA Scandal Arrested on Cruise Ship[/color][/b][/url]\r\nHéctor Trujillo, a judge on the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, was arrested on Friday for his involvement in the FIFA scandal. Trujillo is the general secretary of the Guatemalan soccer federation, and was indicted for corruption along with fifteen others. U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch characterized Mr. Trujillo's involvement as \"purportedly dispensing justice by day, while allegedly soliciting bribes and selling his influence within FIFA.\" The Guatemalan judge was arrested by federal customs agents while on a cruise ship as it docked in Florida. It was not clear whether Mr. Trujillo was aware of the indictment at the time, as he was on the cruise when the justice department announced the charges.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The Li-Fi designed by Harold Hass, a Scottish professor, aims to drastically improve the way signals are broadcast by instead using light pulses. Professor Hass first unveiled the concept at the 2011 Technology, Entertainment and Design conference, and just about four years later, he finally tested the concept, reporting it as successful. Although the project was only tested using 1 Gbps speeds, the Li-Fi system has been tested to be able to reach a supersonic 224 Gbps. Unfortunately, there are downfalls that cannot be ignored. Using light pulses to transfer signals means the Li-Fi system may not be used outdoors, nor can it send signals through walls. Despite the limitation, Li-Fi can mean ridiculous speeds in both work places and at home.\n\n[b][url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151125005775/en/Samsung-Starts-Mass-Producing-Industry%E2%80%99s-128-Gigabyte-DDR4]Samsung Begins Manufacturing 128 GB RAM Stick[/url][/b]\nAfter showing the world their absurdly large 64 GB RAM stick earlier last year, Samsung has doubled their power in the RAM field. According to Samsung, the announced 128 GB stick of RAM will definitely not be focused toward consumers just yet. Instead, the stick is really marketed for usage in datacenters and servers, or in places “where consumers can benefit from innovative technology that enhances their productivity and the overall user experience.” The single stick packs so much memory densely by having thirty-six 4GB “packages” along the board. Thanks to the insane lead it has on its 64 GB predecessor, the new RAM module not only has a speed of 2,400 Mbps, but it also uses half the power, which has large implications for those who run servers and want to increase efficiency while boasting some power.\n\n[b][url=http://www.fueltechnica.com/2015/12/04/waterproof-smartphone-a-soapphone-you-can-wash-with-soap-and-water/]A Smartphone You Can Wash With Soap[/url][/b]\nEver want to take a bath, but not have to put down your phone? Smartphone manufacturer Kyocera has created a phone which saw this exact demand in Japan, which they have named the DIGNO Rafre. The phone features a waterproof exterior, and a waterproof screen. The back casing of the phone even uses a self-repairing material just like previous LG smartphones. Kyocera claims that the phone was developed due to Japanese consumers wanting a phone they could wash with soap if it got dirty. The device will not be marvelous in its specifications as it uses a lower resolution 720p screen and 2 GB of ram, but those seeking a great camera will not be disappointed as the DIGNO Rafre will use a 13 megapixel sensor.
