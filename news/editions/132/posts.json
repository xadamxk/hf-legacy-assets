BackTrack Linux is a subforum of [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=85]Linux, FreeBSD, and Unix Flavors[/url][/b][/color] and can be found by [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=258]clicking here[/url]. The BackTrack Linux subforum description is as follows, \"Backtrack is the Linux-based penetration testing that aids security professionals.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Gaming Group Respawn Userbar Change[/b][/color]\nThe gaming group Respawn, founded by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=657392][b]Astonish[/b][/url], has had a userbar change after quite some time. The slick, new userbar consists of a Halo icon, along with blue and orange coloring. This has been the first Respawn userbar change in a long time.\n\n[color=white][b]New Site Rule Against Gambling[/b][/color]\nSite Owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has finally implemented a long awaited rule. Gambling of any form is no longer allowed on Hack Forums. This includes the advertising of gambling sites, lotteries or paid drawings. We are not too sure what motivated [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] himself to implement a rule like this, but we can only assume it's a personal preference of the preferred content on Hack Forums.

For the 132nd edition of the HF news, we're joined by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633]Vandal[/url]! Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]  I would like to give a shoutout to Zanelot, KyleWTF, Perfect Cell, Tibit, and all the members in The Empire as well as Void.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url]  That's great! So, The Empire is a big part of your HF experience; what is it that you love about the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]   For one, Tibit, Adam, and Chief do a great job at managing the group. I also have made some fantastic friendships with other members in the group, which greatly enhanced my Hack Forums experience. One of my favorite things about The Empire is that it has a large variety of people who are experienced in many subjects.This allows me to discuss so many topics with members and learn so much while discussing. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url]  It's definitely nice to have a place where you fit in and can have a good chat! Vandal, interesting name. How did you come about using that as your online pseudonym? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]   When I was changing my username, I wanted a name that had a meaning to me but no one else would get it unless they knew some history about me. Not wanting to do a good page long story, I will just sum it up to the best of my ability. Two years ago, I got a little too crazy with some friends and vandalized a house. I felt horrible after all this and regretted leaving my house that night. I though I might as well choose something related to that event. I chose Vandal since that was close to the event. I liked the name and chances are, if you saw my name, you would think I just chose it for no reason when in reality, it relates to an event that had a large impact on my life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url]  Haha, it's nice when a nickname has more to it than what it seems. Take my name for example! It means, well, erm, yano...carrot milk :D! What made you first sign up to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]   A couple of my friends were talking about a site called HackForums in a Skype call. I went to it on my own and before registering was looking at some of the tabs; I saw the marketplace tab and really wanted to learn how to make money online. So I registered and then realized I couldn't post in the marketplace without rep so I ended up just posting in other sections.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url]  I see. And what is it that brings you back to the forum each day? And since you've joined, do you think the balance has shifted more from you taking knowledge and learning, towards you giving out knowledge and teaching?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]   Being in The Empire is the main reason I get on here each day. I am fairly inactive compared to others outside of the subforum right now but hope to change that soon by posting other places. I think it has shifted towards to teaching more than learning. However, I am still learning something new each day about various topics from members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Mhmm. I mean, know one ever stops learning, regardless of how knowledgable they may be in their field. // So, now that the dust has settled on the whole HF getting hacked incident, what do you think about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]   At first I was very shocked just because I know Omni does his best to keep the site safe and I was surprised someone got into Witza. Then I started to think it wasn't that big of a deal, all of the information someone would get from the database is available publicly. This just makes it easier for someone to grab information on a specific user, if the data was ever leaked of course. My personal data is on a site now since then, and it hasn't affected me one bit. Sure, it's a little creepy someone can easily find my information, but nothing has happened so far. I also couldn't believe people were mad at Omni. Sure, he's the owner but large sites are an obvious target for hackers to go after, it was bound to happen eventually. This event evidently made HF more secure since Omni is implementing more security to prevent an event like this from happening again.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url]  But it was awesome of Omni to keep us informed with the situation. There was so much initial drama over it, now everyone seems to have forgotten about it! Do you think this has made you up your security? Or whether this will have an impact on other users' security concerns?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]  Yes, Omni told us what happened unlike most owners who would dance around the subject and not give it to us straight. I haven't done anything to really up my security just because of the hack. I check for packages sent to my house each day though that's for sure. I have always been cautious of what sites I visit or what I download. Some users with popular forums have probably gotten whitehats to look at their site for any outstanding exploits since the hack since now they know even the largest sites have exploits.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url]  Well in the modern technological age, I suppose you can ever be too safe, security-wise. Anyway, Vandal, thank you so much for your time! Would you like to make any final comments before concluding the interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1403633][color=white][b]Vandal:[/b][/color][/url]  Thanks for being a fantastic interviewer and I hope everyone has a productive week. I hope you have a wonderful night CarrotMilk and thank you for choosing me as your interviewee.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431]Pali[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: For this edition of the HF News, we've pummeled Dr. Wily to a pulp to talk to Pali. Any shoutouts or comments you want to make before continuing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Sure, iNviZ, THL, Infamous, νιятυαℓнα¢кєя, bugga, Hexicidal, Nathaniel, Stay Plural, and all of illuminati + Void. Trying not to leave anyone out. :P\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: I don't blame you. How did you become a part of the two groups you're a part of?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: bugga invited me for my help in the Deal Dispute section + my knowledge in the places wanted. For Propitious iNviZ said he added me because he always saw me doing good around the forums. I was in Propitious from the start, and I've never felt more at place.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Tough question: to which group do you feel more connected? You've led both groups and have ties to both sets of leaders.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Infamous will always be #1 in my heart. I don't feel more at place elsewhere.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: And why would that be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Everyone is Infamous connects, I feel as if everyone is being \"real\" with one another. No one puts up an act, pretending to be someone they're not.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: I'm in the group too... and it's true. What makes you connect with illuminati?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: My skills in the marketplace, my humor, and the people. We all are there for each other, which every group aims for, but only a few accomplish.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: What groups do you feel attain that accomplishment?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: As in attain family?\nOut of the current groups, I believe Infamous and illuminati do, perhaps Void but it's too earlier to tell. Out of the groups I have not been in, I think The Alliance is also close within their group. Other then that I can't say. A lot of groups try to be close with one another, but it usually falls flat on them. You can aim to be a family, be nice 'n all, but if you're not being yourself, and your members are putting on some internet egos, then no one is really connecting with anyone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Interesting... why do you think there are so many groups that are practical clones of each other? Lack of originality, or what?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: That's tough to answer. Absence of guidance is usually what occurs. You need great leadership skills, dedication, time, and to be a good person yourself. More importantly, your group has to serve a purpose. Giving it a description is not the same thing, actions speak louder then words. Anyone can label their group as \"HQ\".\nIf you're not dedicated, loyal, and serious, don't bite something you can't chew.\nObviously a lot of smaller things come into play as well, that play big roles such as organization, motivation, rules, etc.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Unique answer. Why do you these groups fail to get to the level that The Alliance, Infamous and illuminati are on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: They fail to serve a purpose. They care too much about what their image is, and too less about what they actually do and support. \nSort of like a user being more into their profile, stats, and reputation, rather then their skills, abilities, and personality.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Too true. Did you meet most of your friends through your groups or on other parts of the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: My friends know I browse HF, but my friends on HF are mainly from HF, and only a very few are from else where, and vise versa. I work with a crew, when I do online business or anything internet/hacking related, and only one of seven of them are from here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do you ever take anything out of HF and apply it to real life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: I joined here when I was 15, and I'll admit, I was a 'bit more into what people thought of me, rather then who I was as a person. That was until I started talking to iNviZ/getting invited into Propitious. I started talking to people one on one, and had a whole new perspective on HF and it's community. I see everyone as a person, rather then a profile. Which we all should, but with the way things are being currently run, everyone is more into their profile, stats, reputation (the number) rather then who they are as a person.\nIn a nut shell, I have more of an understanding of others and can see how people think better. Social Engineering, not blackhat related in this point.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: I have that relationship with some of my friends here, not all. You mentioned you were in a gaming group/clan. Care to elaborate on what exactly that is?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: It's not a group or clan really, nor is it gaming related, I think of it as a crew. We work together, we help each other, we teach each other. It's private. It's also not related to HF, we don't do anything public-ally, the group is made up of us, us seven, and it's only for us seven. I've been in it for 10 months now. Since we're not public, and it's just for us, there's no need for a name. Kind of hard to explain something private. This is the first I spoke of us, directly, on HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Well how many people read these things, anyways? 🤣 Only everyone who reads the news. If it's private I won't push it further than that... are members of your crew also connected via a family/brotherhood?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: I have not said anything I'm not supposed to, I've ensured that. :x\nWe've met all from the internet, one way or another. We're all knowledgeable in hacking related subjects, so it's no surprise to find one of us here. It was just a coincidence. None of us have seen f2f besides through cam. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: That's awesome... but all the time we have too. :c any closing shoutouts or comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Thank you for choosing me, thanks to those who read this, and thank you HF Writers, I appreciate the news and Wiki team as well. \n[/spoiler]",

Among the select few this snapshot was granted to SethBling, renowned master of Redstone who runs a popular [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/sethbling]YouTube channel[/url]. Sethbling uploaded a video about Minecraft Realms, in which he talks about the new feature. When the Minecraft Realms button is clicked, a menu identical to the multiplayer menu is shown. There has been much speculation regarding the topic, however it seems as if these 'Realms' are servers hosted by Mojang. When Sethbling opened his Minecraft Realms menu, \"Zorcan1's World\" is displayed because \"Zorcan1\" had invited Sethbling to his world. Although the world was created by Zorcan1, he did not have Admin permissions. Although no announcement has been officially made by Mojang, Minecraft Realms is an exciting new feature which shows much potential. Sethbling's video can be viewed [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-gnkyutGhI]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot 13w09b[/color][/b]\nThis week brings yet another snapshot full of bug fixes, although there is a very interesting surprise included in this week's release. In the snapshot changelog it was stated that \"Mobs can now ride stuff that rides other stuff.\" What does this mean? Well for mapmakers it means that, through worldedit, mobs can now be stacked one on top of the other. It's a bit of a confusing concept, although CaptainSparklez explained it quite well in a [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tndGDMOK764]video about the new feature[/url]. This week's full changelog is a bit lengthy, however a few notable points are:\n[list]\n[*]Mobs can now ride stuff that rides other stuff\n[*]Players riding stuff will keep it when logging off (ie, if you’re on a minecart and log off, you will take that minecart with you)\n[*]Animated blocks and items in texture packs now requires the animation definition (previously it was optional)\n[*]Language files have been updated\n\n[b][color=#87CEEB]Planet Beacon News[/color][/b]\n[*]PlanetBeacon recently switched hosts and faced a bit of downtime this week\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1262623]Sacred[/url] got lucky and found a base full of diamonds; four stacks of 'em!\n[*]Demented recently finished their 20 layer endermen farm and are now working on creating a [url=http://i.imgur.com/FI9rqBc.jpg]creeper grinder[/url], the first of it's kind on the server.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017]Ferny[/url] has recently started to take new players into his faction Nemesis, where he provides them with basic armor and a base to build up.\n[/list]\n\n[align=center]\n[b][color=#FFA500]Featured Server of the Week[/color]   [color=#9400D3] KnightCraft![/color][/b]\nThis week's featured server is KnightCraft!

Gamers can enter the alpha phase by pre-purchasing the game through Steam. The alpha phase will showcase four missions, a few weapons and vehicles, two multiplayer scenarios and much more, including mod support. \"The Arma III alpha is a big milestone in the project's development. Testing early and often puts us on the right track towards improving performance, stability and delivering on our goal of creating a robust final release,\" said Arma III co-creative director Jay Crowe in a statement. \"It's also a big opportunity to get the game in the hands of our passionate community, which enables them to start work on their own creations, tailored to the fourth generation of the Real Virtuality engine.\" ARMA III is due out in Q3 2013.\n\n[color=white][b]Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Release Date[/b][/color]\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag will release on October 29th according to the Ubisoft website and will release on current-gen and next-gen consoles.

The charge specifically means that the girl had admitted to having sex before marriage. As punishment for the charge, the girl will be lashed 100 times. She can take the lashings now, or she can have them when she becomes an adult.  Zaima Nasheed Aboobakur explained, \"We have explained to her how if she wants to receive the punishment (the lashings) right now she can ... or it can be postponed until she turns 18.\" In addition to the lashings, she will also be confined to her house for 8 months. Amnesty International also reported to CNN that this girl was also in an investigation where her stepfather was suspected of sexually assaulting her.\n\n[b][color=white]Taxi Driver Dies From Police Brutality [/color][/b]\nEight South African officers have been arrested by government officials for being suspected of handcuffing a taxi driver to the back of a police van while dragging him along the road and simultaneously beating him. The world has taken notice of this incident and demanded government action. The State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele stated, \"We view this incident in serious light. We want stern action so that it may send a message to other officers that any untoward conduct will not be tolerated.\" What makes this case so prolific is that a citizen caught the action on video. The police can be seen forcefully handcuffing and dragging the man to the police station. The man ultimately died as a result of the injuries sustained.

The sentence results from being found guilty of assaulting a women in a parking lot and subsequently raping her while stationed in  a U.S. military base in Okinawa. As a result of this outcome, the commander of US military force in Japan, Lt. Gen. Salvatore Angelella, has established a curfew to curb violent acts committed by American soldiers. Incidents like this has created a stressed relationship between the local community and US troops stationed in the area.\n\n[b][color=white]Four Chinese Men Executed for Slaying 13[/color][/b]\nIn Thai province of Chiang Rai in 2011, 13 Chinese sailors had been slain. Myanmar drug kingpin Naw Kham and three of his associates were executed after being found guilty of the massacre. Xinhua, Chinese-state news, described the kingpin as \"the largest armed drug trafficking gang on the Mekong River.\" As for the method of execution, all four of the men received lethal injections.  Prosecutor Zhang Weiting supported the execution by remarking, \"Intentional murder is the heaviest crime in China and the murderers deserve their sentence.\" At the scene of the crime, the police initially found a dozen bodies and about a million dollars in amphetamines.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/252z8[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nOn February 27, the rumored 'iWatch' allegedly designed by Apple was officially patented. The patent was originally filed in 2011, so the officials must have faced a delay. Patent identification (US 20130044215) is said to have the ability to connect to other devices, via WiFi or Bluetooth. Designed to look similar to other iDevices, but only operate as a watch, rumors are spreading fast about the device.\n\n[color=white][b]Samsung[/b][/color]\nSamsung had taken action in China to disallow Apple to sell iDevices, due to 'data transferring patents' that a Samsung company in Japan owned. The judge concluded that the company's request was 'insincere' and due to the Samsung's lack of community with Apple, the lawsuit came to a end.\nOn the brighter side of things, earlier this week Samsung had released news about a futuristic plan to win business from Apple. The new feature called \"KNOX\"  is said to split your Samsung device into two halves, one for business, and one for personal use. This feature is said to be for Samsung Enterprise devices, and plans to enable the ability to remotely control the business half by IT guys. It is said to work for SAFE verified phones, which currently include the Samsung S3 and Galaxy Note 2.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/252zj[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Will Nicole Richie Reach Her Billionaire Dream?[/b][/color]\nNicole Richie has said she is seriously hoping to reach billionaire status by the time she retires at age 40, in nine years time. She has been part of several reality television shows and also owns a successful fashion business, which she is expecting to continue rapidly expanding over the next few months. An insider close to her commented that, \"She wants to be a billionaire by the time she turns 40.\" Nicole and her Good Charlotte rocker husband Joel Madden have children: Harlow, five, and Sparrow, three, together. The driving push behind Nicole's determination is her children. She wants to give them the best start in life they could possibly receive from any mother. \"The kids won't even be in high school. They can travel and put their money to good use around the world,\" the insider explained. Nicole hopes to retire from the industry at age 40 and she will become a full time mother to help support her children. Joel, a judge on the Australian version of \"The Voice\" and a successful band leader has said that he thinks Nicole cares far more about the money she earns. Joel himself is reported to not be anywhere near as ambitious when it terms to his pay.\n\n[color=white][b]Rihanna 'vulnerable' After Romance with Chris Brown[/b][/color]\nThe famous singer Rihanna has said that she feels extremely vulnerable after the backlash about her romance with Chris Brown. Rihanna has reunited with her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, who infamously assaulted her in 2009. Due to the drama which resulted in the break-up between the two, many have criticised Rihanna for the decision to take him back and give him a second chance in the relationship. In the Grammy Awards this year, Rihanna and Chris Brown seemed like a \"couple in-love\" as that were seated next to each other, although they were bombarded with violent, hateful messages. People shouted at her for getting back with Chris and it has left Rihanna nervous about her decision to get back together with Brown. \"Rihanna used to feel invincible, like she could do anything and people would love her, but now she feels vulnerable and under attack by people who are angry that she's back with Chris,\" a source has told Heat magazine. Rihanna recently admitted she was in a new relationship with Chris Brown, after rumours of the couple dating had been spread around. She appeared to be certain that the Rolling Stones star would not physically harm her again. She has said she did expect a few people to understand her decision, however she was left disappointed after receiving so much endless criticisms.. \"She got such a scare,\" the source said. \"Chris has told her it'll blow over, but her management have expressed concern. Now, she can't help but think twice about the relationship.\" Chris, who was present at Sir Elton John's annual Oscars has said, \"We are back together. She is the most beautiful girl in the world. But I'm sad she couldn't be here tonight; she is rehearsing for her tour.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Justin Bieber Happy Despite \"worst birthday\"[/b][/color]\nDespite a disappointing birthday for the singer Justin Bieber, he has thanked his close fans for bringing a smile back to his face. Bieber, who turned 19-years-old on Friday, immediately logged into Twitter where he expressed his gratitude for their support. Justin had attempted to enter the Cirque Du Soir club in London for his birthday with many of his friends, however he was reportedly annoyed when he found out that his friends would not be allowed in as they were underage. \"I see and saw all the posts from around the world. U got me smiling. Love u. Thank u. #beliebers\", he wrote on his Twitter page on Saturday. The teenage success also re-tweeted a supportive post from his manager Scooter Braun. \"Life is a roller coaster. Just know when u dip low it is only to build excitement as u will fly high again. Enjoy the journey.\" A source has said that when they arrived they were refused entrance to the club for looking underage. Justin's friend, actor Jaden Smith, 14, was said to be among them, along with Justin's rumoured new flame Ella-Paige Roberts Clarke. \"We, like all clubs in London, operate a strict age policy,\" a club spokesman has commented. \"As a few of the members of the party were under the suitable age of 18, the security team at Cirque Du Soir, London clearly explained this rule and refused entry to the club for anyone who could not provide us with adequate proof of age.\" Despite the mishap, Justin did have an enjoyable time with those who were allowed in and it was reported that he had spent $12,000 on the occasion.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBOE1aUNZVo[/yt]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/252zA[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nPrince has been replaced with Adam.
