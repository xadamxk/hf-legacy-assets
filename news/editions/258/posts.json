Do you have any shoutouts you want to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] I would love to give a shoutout to Rule34 for being an awesome guy and a shoutout to Sinister for being the realest writer I know.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] To get started, mind telling us a little bit about yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] I am just a guy on Hackforums that likes helping people. I have been a little inactive lately do to unforeseen events however I am trying to become more active again. I usually play videogames on the PlayStation 4 or the PC, so if you're a gamer, hit me up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I'm pretty sure you and I both know about the latest release of W10. What's your opinion on it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] Meh. You have all the haters that don't like new things, then you have the people who loves to be adventurous. I think everyone knew there were going to be a load of bugs and errors from the start. I for one, love Windows 10. I think it looks, and runs, one hundred times better than the previous Windows renditions. I have been fortunate enough to not run into any major issues in my first month of using Windows 10, however some people aren't so fortunate, and I try my best to help those who have problems with Windows 10. However if you're contemplating whether to install Windows 10, my advice to you is to try it. See if you like it. If you don't, you can always downgrade DIRECTLY to your previous OS from Windows 10 without losing any files.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What are some of the problems people are experiencing with Windows 10?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] The majority of users tend to experience a video card/video driver problem causing errors in their display, or later when they try to game. However I believe most of these have been fixed since the launch with the release of NVidia's Windows 10 compatible drivers (I don't know about AMD, unfortunately.). Alternately other users may sometimes have issues with their audio, although most of those issues seem to have been fixed now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] From my perspective, it seems like you're an expert for W10. How do you know so much about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] Hm. That has been what feels like forever ago. I'll be honest, I joined this forum because I wanted to learn how to be a \"l33t hax0r\". That was a little over two years ago. To this day, I still don't know how to hack. If I ever did though, I would only use it for good purposes. The ethics behind blackhat hacking I just can't stomach. Stealing all kinds of stuff from innocent people is just not my forte.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Do you ever plan on learning how to hack?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] Maybe sometime in the distant future, I just don't have the time right now. I would rather start to learn how to code or something of that nature first.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I see. Can you give us your honest opinion on the current groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] I suppose my opinion are probably slightly biased, but I will do my best to give fair opinions.\n[spoiler]\nNull - I haven't really seen them around.. that's probably because I don't really spend much time in the hacking or coding sections. Their owner, Nobility, is very respectable though.\n\nEcho - Let's be honest. When Understalker was there and before the group member purge, Echo had a bunch of kids that liked to troll. To this day I still don't understand the true purpose for that group.\n\nSpecialists - Haven't really seen them around much. I have only known a couple members in Specialists. Apparently the SF is dead according to those people, but it could be active now, I don't know.\n\nRed Lions - Rarely ever see anyone from this group other than Alone Vampire and iHydra.\n\nAxiom - I have been in this group from the start. All the members in it are cool and chill. We play videogames together and such, but that's about it. Still a cool group to be in.\n\nArchive - No clue what the purpose of this group is.\n\nCrypto - See a lot of members from Crypto in the Cryptocurrency exchange section (obviously lol). I know a couple members from Crypto and they're cool. zSerity is pretty chill.\n\nAnimeFAN! - I have been in this group for a good amount of time. Most of the members in AF! are pretty cool. Some members creep me out a lot but others don't. Tweety and Assault are pretty chill. It's too bad it's being sold.\n\nL'appel du vide - Was kicked from the group a while ago and I don't know why, but with the time I had in this group I met a lot of chill members. They're all pretty cool. Hexi is awesome.\n\nPirates - I have been in this group for a while now and I must say, the SF is pretty active, but I just don't see the general purpose of the group. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice group. I feel like it's just for lounging.\n\nDebug - This group has been going downhill in my opinion ever since the turmoil between Porygon and Nex.\n\nTitans - I have seen a good amount of members from this group, and surprisingly there are only 26 of them. They seem to be friendly and like helping people. Titans doesn't accept buyins and only accepts through recruitments. I think this group is about as HQ as you can get.\n\nThe Brotherhood - I have seen a large number of these people around, however it's probably because a good amount of them are apart of the White Hat Helper Student course. Cryptic and Roger are both chill af so I have no doubt this group is of high quality.\n\nRoyalty - Another marketing group... which I don't understand but w/e. Barely any users in it right now so I will have to wait until they get some more activity to give an opinion on them.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting feedback. Are you a fan of anime by any chance?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I guess you could call me a fan. I am not that kind of person that will try to act all cutsie Japanese but I do occasionally watch anime. No, not that tentacle porn shit, but actual good anime.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] With AnimeFan being sold, what do you hope the \"new group\" would be like?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] I can only hope it's something original. Something that has a real purpose other than just being a lounge group, or a group just for the userbar.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What do you mean by that? Can you give us an example?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] It seems a lot of groups nowadays are basically just there for the UB or there for the subforum lounge and don't actually benefit the community as a whole in the slightest. An example of a group that does benefit the community is like Titans. Their members are one of the most helpful on HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] It would be great to see another group like that! Thanks for joining us, ℒitecoin! Anything else you would like to say before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1748669][color=white][b]ℒitecoin:[/b][/color][/url] Hm. Nope. Thanks for taking the time to interview me. It was a real treat.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

Facebook users have been wanting a “dislike” button for quite some time and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Facebook, has confirmed that the “dislike” button will be implemented soon. Scammers are now creating a scam campaign to allow early access to the beloved “dislike” button. A group of “invite only” links will be spread around through Facebook, requiring the user to click the link to gain access. Once the links are clicked, it’ll spread to the user’s friends and pages. After completing the spreading of the links, the user will be asked to fill out surveys that will get personal information and potentially install malware on the computer.

Hackers are using Amazon UK’s email message to alert Amazon users that other users have had their accounts compromised. They then suggest that the users complete the account verification process by clicking on the “GET STARTED” link. Once the individuals click on the link, this is where the phishing actually takes place. The hacker’s fake site asks the users to put in their login credentials and then get redirected to a page where it asks for payment card details and other personal information that is directly related to your account. Secure yourself and be sure to check the authenticity of an email and the links that are sent to you.

New methods of ATM hacking have come into play and card stealing is on the rise. Security teams are working hard to try and upgrade each ATM machine to help prevent credit card theft. However, hackers are still utilizing the ones that are out of date and are still using the older operating system. Earlier this month, a next-generation ATM hack came into effect by holding your card into the machine and not allowing you to take it back out. The scammer would then retrieve your card information without any hassle. Another common ATM method is the hackers install a scamming kit right in front of the card slot. The kit includes a little camera so the hacker can see the cardholder’s PIN number and card number. The security team is working on updating each machine, but in the mean time, be safe and observe your surroundings.

Nine issues in CFNetwork were fixed, this issues allowed attackers to intercept decrypted SSL data, add unintended cookies for websites, intercept TSL and SSL connections, and bypass HTTP Strict Transport Security. A series of kernel exploits were also fixed, this exploits lead to denial of service attacks and memory leaks. Apple also fixed a series of vulnerabilities in ApplePay, Safari, and GameCenter. Some of those bugs allowed attackers to see recent ApplePay purchases, steal a GameCenter email, or see a user's bookmarks on Safari without a passcode. In addition, Apple has added 2FA support via iOS for iCloud accounts, which is a huge step in the right direction for protecting iCloud accounts.

Fortunately, only users who used a plaintext password were affected, those who used the dot lock or passcode were unaffected. This vulnerability has enormous implications since it bypass the main security feature that most users rely on. The research noted that the on-screen keyboard and soft buttons do not work, but information can still be accessed via the Android Debug Bridge. The researcher also remarked that this is not the only vulnerability he found, but they others have been reported and a patch is hopefully in progress for them as well.

The trojan now has a list of 55 URLs that feature a series of US and Canadian banking sites and when visited, webinjects are launched. The trojan steals login information and then attempts to trick the users into giving even more information. The trojan also supports real-time form grabbing, VNC use, and MITM uses. Researchers now question whether or not the information that is being stolen is being sold online or not. Some evidence of this has been found, the bot appears to be communicating with a site called Btcshop that is used to sell SOCKS Proxies and Personally Identifiable Information.

While the game has been confirmed to be released on the Playstation 4, it has yet to be announced whether or not it’s going to be an exclusive on the Sony gaming console. It is set to be released in Japan in January 2016, but no further information on international release dates has been announced. The title, along with a short trailer and screenshots, was announced at Sony’s Tokyo Game Show press conference.

The news of this delay comes from an update on the game’s official website, which can be located [url=http://www.mightyno9.com/en/20150915]here[/url]. This delay is not unusual, as the game was formerly planned for a release in 2015 but was later moved to an unknown date in 2016. Mighty No. 9 is a game that was crowdfunded through Kickstarter that is being spearheaded by Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, with the game being viewed as a spiritual successor to the Mega Man series.

The hardware is mostly the same save for a few aesthetic changes, mainly focusing on more vibrant color options for the Playstation 4 HDD covers and four new colors for the Playstation 4 controller, including silver.

Following a recent leak, we get to have a small glimpse of next year’s Nexus line – and the specs are extremely impressive. Produced by technology manufacturer Huawei, the Nexus 6 will feature a 5.6 inch display, which will pack lots of pixels, sitting on a 2560 by 1440 screen resolution. It will also pack a 1.9 GHz octa-core processor produced by Qualcomm. The sensor will be a 12 MP camera in the back, capable of shooting 4K video, and an 8 MP sensor on the front of the device. The Nexus 6 will come with Android’s newest version of the OS: 6.0 Marshmallow, upon release.

The included tablets will be Amazon’s Fire; a 7-inch, quad core tablet. The device runs on Amazon’s operating system, code named “Bellini”, and according to Amazon, the tablet is focused on entertainment and media. It features a large 128 GB of storage, and can will come in sizes of seven inches, eight inches, and ten inches, with the eight and ten inch variety being available later in the year. For those who want one for your family and friends as well: fear not, the six-pack is always an option. Six of the Fire tablets can be bought from Amazon for $250, which is still cheaper than a one-pack of many modern-day tablets. The tablet will be released as early as September 30th.

With a ridiculous 7680 x 4320 pixel resolution, the Sharp TV will have a pixel density of 104 PPI (pixels per inch). In a hilarious ironic twist, watching 8K TV will prove troublesome for buyers. No broadcaster currently broadcasts 8K content in Japan (country television has been released in), meaning you’ll have to supply your own 8K content. If you can pass that hurdle, you’ll still have to pass the biggest hurdle of them all, the television’s $133,000 (¥16,000,000) price tag. For those who get the opportunity furnish their office or sell their house for it, comes definitely great viewing experience, to say the least.
