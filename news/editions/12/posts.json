However, tomorrow, Interactive Tuesday will happen, where I post about people's things, and headlines if there are any that early in the week, however, I doubt it.\r\n\r\nIn other news, Reviewers applications will be chosen soon! Also, check out the first Interactive Tuesday which can be found in this section. Tomorrow, I'll post a new one of that, with all new interactiveness.",
