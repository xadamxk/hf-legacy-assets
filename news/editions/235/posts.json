In order to maintain Hack Forums' hard-earned SEO stats, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has been toying with mobile viewing and is considering a responsive design since a dedicated app is out of the question. On April 9th, many mobile users were reporting the site appearing crushed together and posts were not uniform. This issue has since been fixed. There have been countless requests to make the forum more mobile-compatible, and users are excited to see the mobile changes in action.

On top of two-factor authorization and the other handful features we have received in the past couple weeks, we now have a way to 'scan' a member before dealing with them. At the time of writing this, it is in beta for Ub3r members only and is still being worked on. It contains information regarding IP changes, deal disputes, and more.

However, following the ban of both leaders, the group fell to pieces and members lost hope. Fortunately, Debug is back on course and intends to teach any willing member how to program.

Welcome to the 235th Edition of the HF News. Any shoutouts before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] Sure! I'd like to give a shoutout to my Titans family.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's alright. So tell me Chaos, how did you find HackForums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] Funny story. I was introduced to HF through a friend on a RuneScape Private Server, he claimed HF had hacks for RuneScape and whatnot, I know now how stupid I had been for thinking it was true, however I followed and found myself opening to a great community and a cool bunch of people. I definitely do not regret my decision at all. I was also eager to add to my graphics skill and had heard through friends with similar interests that HF had a whole category dedicated to the graphics scene. Through HF I believe I have drastically improved on my graphics expertise, and hope to keep doing so.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's great. How long have you been doing graphics?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] Roughly five years, although my work probably does not show it, haha. It was something I was presented to by my brother and have stuck by it ever since, it is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone willing to take it up.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Nice. So, how long do you spend on HackForums everyday?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] It's something that's been frustrating me lately but I find myself spending hours upon hours on HF, you can see that through my online time and the actual amount of time I've been here at HF. It's controversial however I've been trying to cut down lately, I believe myself to spend roughly 9 hours on HF daily, somewhat of an addiction. It's also surprisingly enough been cutting into my school work & revision.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] How has HackForums affected your daily life?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] I wake up in the morning and the first thing I seem to do is check HF, it's both embarassing and irksome. Just the other day I was at the cinema watching Fast and Furious 7 (great film by the way) and found myself pulling my phone out my pocket and browsing HF halfway through, my friends gave me a slightly unusual look and ever since I've been focusing on limiting my time on HF, realizing I've been somewhat overly attached to the forum. I understand most people would take a vacation ban and it's something I plan on doing in the near future, I know I'll be looked down upon for my response however it's nothing but the truth.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of your daily life, what activities do you partake in apart from browsing HackForums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] I actually play football (soccer to you 'muricans) at a semi-professional level for Charlton Academy, as it's something I've always planned on pursuing as a career although something I believe I'm too late in doing so. Aside from football I also do other sport-related activities such as tennis, badminton & basketball; I'm an eager sportsman. Putting the sports to the side, I am currently still in school so I find myself dedicating a lot of my time to schoolwork & revision, excluding the 6 hours of school itself. Trust me though, I'm not an all too boring person, I do also enjoy going to the park with my friends for a kick about or to town.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting! Do you partake in any academic extracurricular activities as well?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] A few, I participate in business or economic related activites after and during school, more out of the enjoyment aspect rather than the educational. I do also partake in a debating club - much to the disapproval of many - however I believe it helps me build my speech skills & my knowledge in general, it definitely does have an educational factor. It is one reason I love both Void and the SRPP section so much.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of debating, have you attended any debating tournaments? And also, with your debating experience, how do you plan on utilizing it to benefit HackForums at all?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] I have participated in small school-related competitions but not at a tournament level, I've never took it upon myself to do so; I guess I'm not one who aims for over-achieving, although probably something I should plan on doing. I have never really though tof using it at benefit HF, to the SRPP section & it's members maybe (just kidding) although it would be difficult to see how I could use it at the benefit of HF, I assume you mean by arguing for or against suggestions which is something I'm already doing, haha!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So, have you made any recent large contributions to HackForums? Do you plan on doing so in the future?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] I've created a few tutorials over the past month, some being graphics related and others gaming. At the donation and other community aspects I also recently upgraded a member to L33T and have donated a fair amount. I plan on doing whatever I can to ensure I help out the community as much as possible, starting with tutorials and to hopefully building it into something more.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's great! Well, that's all the time we have for this interview unfortunately. Are there any closing comments that you have for us?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2572841][color=white][b]Chaos:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to congratulate and thank the news/wiki team for all their continuous effort and their recent work that goes unnoticed to many. I'd also like to thank yourself for interviewing me, Astute.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=black][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753]Butt Cheeks[/url][/color][/font][/size][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Hey there welcome to the HF news. This time we're joined with Butt Cheeks. Any shout outs before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to thank Canada., PositiveEnergy, and Daisy even though I don't know where she is anymore.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Shout out to them! What's your story? How'd you get where you are?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'm 17 years old, and have been on HF for a little less than four years I believe. Always been a huge fan of the forum, but a lot of the time I do not have time to get on due to real life. Anyways, I have not been on HF for around a year. School, girlfriend, and sports were just too busy in my life. But recently, an event has happened that will forever alter my life. I made some poor decisions, which ended up costing me big time. I was expelled from my school as a junior, so now I will be having to homeschool for the rest of this year. It's not easy not being able to see my friends, my girlfriend, and especially not being able to play baseball. But homeschooling is going extremely well. I have mostly A's, and have a lot more free time to spend with my family.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Glad that everything is working out alright. What'd you end up doing when you first joined the forum?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] First like most of the users on the forum, I was trying to get free lobbies for xbox. But I ended up learning how to make a little cash, and fell in love. Since then, my HF journey has just been one big scheme to make money.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] I remember you being in 143 back when it first started up. How are groups different from back when 143 and others were around?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] 143 is about the best group you could have ever been a part of. For me, 143 was so great because of its community. So many groups claim to have this, but 143 was the only one that did that I was a part of. You could talk there without being judged, and someone was always there to help you out. Whether it was money problems, innuendo, etc. Someone was there. \r\nBack then groups meant more than they do now, now it is really just a userbar.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] How was HF back when you joined compared to how it is now? Was there any particular point in time that you enjoyed the most?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] HF back when I joined was fun. Since I was just getting started, it was more of a \"rush\" than it is now. Now I just like to browse when I am bored. But I would say HF has remained pretty consistent with how it has always been.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Have any advice for people who want to make money online?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] Many HF eBooks are crap, but some are actually gold. But if you want a fail-proof method to make money online, go out and figure out a method for yourself. If you come up with your own working method, you never have to worry about spending money on useless junk.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Very true. What else do you do in your spare time?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] I game a little, and I also love to watch baseball and football on TV. My favorite teams are the braves, and Alabama.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for taking the time to do this interview with me dude. Any final words?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753][color=white][b]Butt Cheeks:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks to everyone that I have ever met on this website, and for those who have made my stay so great! Shoutout to the group Fortune. I hope everyone has a wonderful day!\r\nThanks for letting me partake in the interview.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

The young man, Domanik Green, had used this password to log into he teacher's computer and change the desktop background image to a picture of two men kissing, but since one of the computers he accessed contained questions to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT), albeit encrypted, it was treated as a much more serious offense. Though it is easy to blame the child for his wrongdoings, it is important for the system administrators to maintain a higher level of security as there has been a history of weak passwords, poor network security, and unauthorized access at the school. During an interview with Green, it had been discovered that several students had not only known the password, but some had even been in trouble with inappropriate use of it. They'd often log into one another's computers to use the cameras to play pranks, but none of them understood the repercussions that could have, and ultimately did, ensue.

This attack was seemingly executed by an Islamic group as several Pro-Islam photos and videos were posted on the page as well as statements regarding the French Charlie Hebdo massacre tragedy that took place in January. However, precautions by TV5Monde should have been taken such as not having passwords written down out in the open. David Delos, a reporter and correspondent for TV5Monde, unwittingly filmed himself in front of a staff member's desk which had been covered with sticky notes containing various usernames and passwords. He had revealed the passwords for the station's official Twitter and Instagram accounts which were later used to aid in the cracking of YouTube and Facebook passwords. The station has since updated to more secure passwords, since the password \"lemotdepassedeyoutube\" (English Translation: \"the password of youtube\") is highly insecure and easily guessable. This goes to show that even in today's high-tech environments, a simple user error can lead to detrimental effects.

With over 55,000 units in hospitals around the world, he found a potentially deadly vulnerability that allows attackers from within the network or even across the Internet to raise and lower the dosage remotely. The [url=http://www.hospira.com/en/products_and_services/infusion_pumps/Lifecare/]LifeCare PCA Infusion System[/url], the model that was used by Rios' hospital, does not use authentication in its internal libraries for drug administration, so an unauthorized attacker can load malicious libraries that raise the dose limit to lethal levels. The company boasts that the machine has inherent mechanisms for ensuring that human-errors don't result in lethal doses, such as accidentally inputting too high of a dose. Rios did not find that you could change the actual dosage, but he highlighted the inherent insecurity of this preventative measure.

The flaw is said to be around since 2011 at the earliest, and has been patched by Apple this week. The vulnerability, known as \"rootpipe\", was discovered by a security software engineer last year. Full details have been released since the patching of this vulnerability, by Apple, with the release of 10.10.3. According to the security software engineer Emil Kvarnhammar, this vulnerability (CVE-2015-1130), which is a part of the Admin framwork of OS X, has been around in OS X since the release of OS X 10.7 (Lion), which was released in July of 2011. Kvarnhammar has also stated that the flaw can be exploited with physical access to the device, but could also be exploited through remote code execution exploits. Apple was informed of the exploit on October 3rd, 2014 and later stated that it was going to be patched in mid-January, but was patched in March with the release of OS X 10.10.3 public beta, and eventually to everyone last Wednesday.

In a statement made last week, they referred to the vulnerability as \"Darwin Nuke\" and exposes devices running OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks which are remotely activated. Such attacks could damage devices and impact the networks they are connected to. In the statement, Kaspersky states: \"At first sight, it is very hard to exploit this bug, as the conditions attackers need to meet are not trivial ones,” said Anton Ivanov, senior malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab. “But persistent cybercriminals can do so, breaking down devices or even affecting the activity of corporate networks.” Kaspersky also stated that the vulnerability effects 64-bit processors and iOS 8, meaning iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2, and iPad mini 3 are all vulnerable. Kaspersky recommends that all OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 users update their devices to the latest software update, 10.10.3 and iOS 8.3.

Earlier in the week, Mozilla released Firefox 37.0 which included support for HTTP/2, an internet standard which allows all web connections to be encrypted when HTTPS isn't supported by the page. The update was designed to improve the some of the basic security for the browser, but unfortunately a flaw allowed one researcher to find a way to bypass the certificate verification when web servers redirected vistors through the HTTP/2 systems. As a result of this flaw, invalid SSL certificate warnings would not display properly and attackers could use a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to impersonate legitimate pages and use it to deliver malware or steal confidential data. In the new 37.0.1 update, this bug is fixed by disabling the HTTP/2 encryption. Browsers should update automatically, if not, 37.0.1 can be found on Mozilla's website.

The teaser, confirming that the next game in the series would be Black Ops 3 as opposed to the rumored World at War 3, featured a silhouette of a soldier from the game. The full image of this silhouette has been leaked, showing extremely futuristic gear on the soldier, very nearly confirming a future setting for Black Ops 3. A description of the game discovered on the official Call of Duty website by Twitter user @ThaTiemsz describes the game as follows: “Call of Duty®: Black Ops 3 is the first title for next-gen hardware in the critically acclaimed Black Ops series. Developed by Treyarch, the award-winning creator of the two most played games in Call of Duty® history. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 deploys players into a dark, twisted future where a new breed of Black Ops soldiers emerges and the lines are blurred between our own humanity and the technology we created to stay ahead, in a world where cutting-edge military robotics define warfare. With three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies, it providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious Call of Duty ever.” The game's formal reveal has been set by the teaser to release on April 26th.

The url itself lends to the idea that whatever the link leads to, it's \"secret\" for the time being. The link can be found here: [url]http://www.jp.square-enix.com/secret/[/url]. The reveal for this is expected to be on April 13th, since the Facebook sharing link in the corner brings that date up. Absolutely zero information besides what's been shared here, along with a few jumbled letters and numbers on the \"secret\" page, is currently known about this project. Square Enix is known for developing the Final Fantasy game series among a myriad of other famous titles.

It was the third major update to iOS 8, bringing with it new emoji updates, wireless carplay & the spacebar UI fix. The new iOS is finally available as an over-the-air download.\n\nThe main focus on the release of the new iOS was the emoji improvements - most likely due to the complaints - bringing an updated emoji picker that organizes emoji's into lists making them more user-friendly and easier to use. They've also introduced skin tones to emojis for those to create lifelike images of themselves when texting and whatnot. There are also several new flags and updated phone, computer, and watch emoji that now resemble the iPhone, iMac, and Apple Watch. \n\nOther changes include wireless carplay, letting users connect their iPhones to their CarPlay system sans Lightning cable, which supports google two-factor authentication adding to the security and persistence of iOS. The popular Siri module has also gained several new languages due to the increased demand,  plus the ability to make calls using the iPhone's speakerphone. So make sure you've downloaded the new iOS if you haven't already!

These are momentous changes from the website that makes up 75% of the search engine usage. \n\nThe algorithm changes go into effect on the 21st of April affecting mobile searches in all languages online. Google did send out a warning saying that the new mobile friendly updates could make significant impact on how we use our phones whilst browsing & especially the search results; they also offered up a link that allowed website owners to check if their website was mobile-friendly! However those websites that are not mobile friendly will see themselves drop in terms of search results, as Google are planning on ranking websites that are mobile-friendly above those that are not.

Many were eager about the release of the watch and have met their eager with great reviews on the new Apple release. What was expected to be a downfall in Apple's products has been one which could see us into the future, being the company's first product since the iPad in 2010. The watches are available to view in store in the UK and eight other markets around the world, including the US and China.\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook has previously said: \"The Apple Watch is the most personal device we have ever created. It is not just with you, it is on you. And since what you wear is an expression of who you are, we designed Apple Watch to appeal to a whole variety of people with different tastes and different preferences.\" [i][url=http://news.sky.com/story/1462348/apple-watch-arrives-in-stores-around-the-world][size=x-small]>>Source[/size][/url][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",
