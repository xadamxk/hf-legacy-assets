It was all started by the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=74244][color=#99FF00][b]Yin[/b][/color][/url] back on May 16th, 2010. The very first edition of the HF News can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=423656]here[/url]. The sub-forum for it was created about a month later. Currently the project is overseen by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sir[/b][/color][/url], who has led the HF News for over two years now. For this edition, and those that will follow, we have increased the size of the news team as well as introduced new sections to the HF News. If you're interested in joining the HF News team apply [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4310325]here[/url] or if you have something you'd like to report to the news team post [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4205376]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Sales Tags Coming To The Marketplace Soon[/color][/b]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has recently announced that [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4300998]Sales Tags[/url] will soon be up for sale in the marketplace. You can see an example image [url=http://hackforums.net:8080/tag-preview.png]here[/url]. The price range is estimated to be between $1-$5 USD in Omnicoin, with that being the only accepted method of payment. This has caused very mixed responses, many marketers like the idea for their sales threads, however also state that with such a low price it will easily become so over used that it won't have the same appeal and will not stand out as much. Only time will tell how it turns out as it may take some time before this is implemented into the marketplace.\n\n[b][color=white]Omnicoin Price Hike[/color][/b]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has recently increased the price for the Omnicoin award for a second time, which has also been done with the [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/477554565378605056]LTC award recently[/url]. The current price is now set at 5,000 Omnicoin. You can read the announcement [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4303686]here[/url]. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated this is a move to push the use of AllCrypt for Omnicoin exchanges more to drive up the value of Omnicoin rather than using HF exchangers.

After some research by Omniscient, it was discovered that someone was deliberately placing sell orders that were well below the market price, driving the price into the ground. However, this realization has drawn incredible support from the community, with some members attempting to buy out this malicious party. However, despite these efforts, the price remains low. It's important for users to go to [b][url=https://www.allcrypt.com/market?id=672]AllCrypt[/url][/b], and use that market instead of making private deals on HF. If you don't have BTC, get BTC, and go to AllCrypt, and help revitalize the OMC economy. \n\n[b][color=white]Omnicoin Award Price Jumps to 5,000[/color][/b]\nFollowing the downward price spiral, Omniscient raised the price of the Omnicoin award to 5,000, keeping the price approximately constant at $25 USD, and causing a few users to grumble about having to buy more OMC.\n\n[align=center][img]http://vps.brandonanzaldi.com/omc/price.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/oFknyEW.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][u][color=white]Announcements[/color][/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4300207][b]INDEXEUS.ORG[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]\nIndexeus.org, a seemingly innocent website at first glance, allows users to search first and last names to reveal any related emails, passwords and other sensitive information related to that person.

Shoutout to baghead.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Aye, baghead. So being a member who has seen the forum's groups evolve over the past couple years, what's your opinion on the groups that are on the forum currently?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] I joined a while before Omni started to charge for groups. They were pretty cool back then. Most of the groups on the forum today are a financial investment - buy a group, charge members to join, and then sell the group for a higher price. Most of them suck, but there are a few good ones.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Agreed. Since you've pretty much an oldfag in the writers -- what do you think of the changes/expansion that went on?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] It's getting there. The expansion is great - new infrastructure and better organization. There are a lot of new writers, and as you know it was pretty difficult for us to recruit throughout the past week or two. Over time I'm sure we'll figure it out and replace some of the grammatically weaker writers, but for now we're doing what we can with what we have. When I first joined in 2012, the news team probably consisted of ten to twelve writers. Now we're creeping up on fifty, and the news itself has tripled in size. There are new journalists, reserved backup writers, multiple proofreaders, and even a podcast (which you should go listen to by the way).\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Speaking of the podcasts -- How will those work? Will it be a special one time thing, or will you expect to see one of them in each news edition?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm planning on hosting it weekly, with regular writers that participate every installment or two. We'll also be bringing in guest hosts who can elaborate on relevant topics. The current episode is a little rough as it's our first one, but hopefully it's entertaining in that aspect. You better join in sometime!\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Will do, for sure! When you're not browsing HF or playing around on PS, what are you doing?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] Hanging out with friends, playing soccer or lacrosse, jammin' on the drums, sleeping, or drawing.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Since, I'm pretty sure that you're finished with school for the year -- what do you already have planned? I remember you talking about going to see some family soon.\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b] Yea I'm actually out of town right now, but lately I've just been chillin with friends and working\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's pree' cool. Any of your friends that you know in real life use HF, or heard about the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] Nah, not really. Apart from Tristan (anxtrist) who introduced me to the site in 2011, none of my friends know what HF is.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Do you like the direction that HF has taken since you signed up all the way back in 2011?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] I think it would be cooler if HF went east, right now we're headed towards southern Indonesia. But HF has been going the same direction the whole time, the path just happens to lead to southern Indonesia and possibly Uzbekistan.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I feel you. What's one of the things that keeps you coming back to HF?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] There are a few people that keep me on HF, and they're the only reason. Mostly just to mess around. It's also where the fbn subforum is.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] who care?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]:[/b][/color] sometimes i wonder but then i dont\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=x-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News. Today I'm here with HF member RDCA. How's it going RD? Do you have any shotouts you'd like to make?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url] [/b]Eh, shout out to my MRT family and you Writ3r peoples. TH and Para <3\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Lets address the elephant in the room (I'm not talking about your mother for once). You're now a staff member, and rightly so. You have a very good understanding of the rules on HF. Where did you acquire all of this knowledge? (From my HF Rules quiz perhaps?)\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] Yes, I would say correcting your so called 'rules quiz' was a help. Though, all the knowledge stems from the Help Docs and the RANF section. Overall helping members with site issues and technical issues is a great way to learn.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I'm glad I could be of some assistance. I know you've only been staff for a short time, but how has the experience been so far?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] It definitely is a lot of work, but I'm glad I took it. A lot of the more senior Staff members were extremely helpful the first week or two and definitely showed me the ropes. I think I am learning fast and doing well, but only time will tell. People need to realize Staff isn't there to ban everyone and make their time here bad; we're here to enforce rules and keep as many people's experience on HF as positive as possible. Also, warnings aren't the end of the world, they exist as a reminder to follow the rules.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Has becoming staff taken up a lot of your time or do you find that things are relatively the same?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] It takes a bit of time, especially to adjust to the workload. Though, once you're a bit used to reports and develop your own style and system Hack Forums returns to how it used to be, with slightly different responsibilities. I just have less time to patrol the RANF section, but I still do MRT related things and Writ3rs stuff. Being Staff obviously don't consume my life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Well you'd have to have a life to begin with.. You've been on HF for sometime now; what keeps you coming back?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] Well, my future is almost undoubtedly going to be in security and computers. I also have a lot of friends here, some of whom are extremely smart. Thinking about it, shout out to all of Null. They're an extremely smart group of people.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What would your ideal career be and why?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] I'm planning/majoring in Computer Science, though I'm considering a double major with Risk Analysis. My ideal job is owning a giant computer firm, either in security or big enough to have a multifaceted company where security is apart of us.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What's one thing you'd change to better HF?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url] [/b]There are a few things, but they are all with due time. Omniscient is always planning and working. There are very few ideas which he hasn't already thought of himself. If I could just magically change one thing, it would either be fixing the search system, or account security. Those are two very important things which I'm sure Omniscient will conquer one day.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What makes you so special?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url] [/b]Yes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What advice would you give for those looking to become staff?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] I haven't really been here long enough, but dedication pulls through. A lot of people try too hard though, there needs to be balance. You shouldn't be ruining your real life in exchange for an online one. If you can't balance that how can you ever balance the demands of Staff? Overall, the job just isn't for everyone. Just be yourself with an additional bit of kindness and helpfulness. Remember, it is a volunteer position on an online forum, there is no need to make enemies or be bitter. Sure, you can be passionate and angry, but there are limits.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Why do frequently give out warnings to people who don't deserve them?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] I'm warning you for nonsense now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I'm looking forward to it. Thanks again for joining us RDCA, you've provided us with some wise insight. Any last words before I ban you for disallowed blackhat activity?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684]RDCA:[/url][/b] who care.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=x-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253]Bobby Orr[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 200th edition of the HF News, today we're here with Bobby Orr. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Hey 630! I'd just like to give a shout-out to all my old friends from Void!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I was going to ask you about void a little later, but I guess we can jump into that now. How did you like void? Are you still active in SRPP?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] I loved Void, I thought it was the only HQ group on Hack Forums. Everything else is either hacking, gaming, or money making. I was so sad to see it go. As for SRPP, I spend most of my time there. 831 of my total posts are there as well. It can either be the highest of quality sections, or the absolute lowest of quality when the trolls come in.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] How do you feel about the recent rule that non-upgraded members cannot post and that mentors cannot touch the posts there? Has it improved the section at all?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Its a catch 22 rule. On one hand, it did eliminate some trolls, but there were some HQ non upgraded members. On the other hand, many l33ts/ub3rs still troll there constantly, and the mentors can do nothing about it. So I would say, it did not make a difference.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] That's kind of a bummer to hear then. I see you survived the change from Void to Nexus, how's that working out for you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Not that well. I really dislike LoL, but the only reason I'm still in there is due to the fact that some of my old friends are in there. I'm thinking about leaving Nexus later tonight.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's no good. Are there any other HF groups you have your sights set on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, just The Empire and Polymath. Everything else (in my eyes) seems low quality, with the exemption of FBN.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not gonna weigh into groups too much, but they seem alright. There's a whole mystery factor with Polymath that bugs me. So how did you end up finding Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] I ended up finding Hack Forums while searching for a minecraft client. I found it, and just fell in love with the site. I found the SRPP section and just got addicted to it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Do you still play Minecraft at all or any other games for that matter?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. I play Minecraft and Rust a lot at the moment. I'm saving up for a gaming PC, so until then, anything that works on Mac I'll have to play. I'm trying to get bootcamp set for it, but it seems it won't work.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What servers do you play on? I was obsessed with Hacker Craft, but quit after the shutdown.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Mainly on Shotbow, I play a lot of the Wasted game mode. Other than Shotbow, I play on Wynncraft, which is like a RPG server, no PvP. As for modded servers, I play Attack of the B team servers a lot. Great modpack.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So what do you do outside of the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] I play a lot of Airsoft. I really got into it recently, I'm waiting on the delivery of a few more guns and some accessories. Other that, street and ice hockey. Looking for new hobbies as well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! I love playing hockey. So how you rate your overall Hack Forums experience on a scale of 1-10.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] I would rate it around a 8.5/10. I really love it here!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could change one thing about the site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Oh jeez. Only one thing? I'd have to say I would get rid of the eBook Bazaar and ban the sale of any type of eBook that does not meet extremely strict guidelines.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'd have to agree I'm not a fan of eBooks. Well that's all the time we have for this interview. Would you like to make any concluding remarks before we wrap up this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2084253][color=white][b]Bobby Orr:[/b][/color][/url] Well, thanks for interviewing me, and I can't wait to read this next edition! And I love your signature man!\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=x-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138]Predator[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 200th edition of the HF News, today we're here with Predator. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I'll give a huge Shout-Out to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337]Tibit[/url], the noobiest hacker of them all!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] I agree. You are quite active in his group, The Empire. What has your experience been like during your time in the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] I've been in The Empire since about 2-3 weeks after the group was created, so I'm one of the oldest members there... Overall it has been an extremely positive experience. There have been ups and downs, but it's a great group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] The [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1860595]first thread[/url] in your post history is from October 2011 but you joined HF in March 2011. How did it take you more than six months to post your first thread?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] I had joined and registered then forgot about the site. When I came back and tried to register my e-mail was already registered so I just recovered my account. I registered when I was first starting to experiment with 'hacking' but at the time I was registering on a million sites and never really logged back on to any of them. For some reason I came back to HF, and well... Here I am.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] What sort of hacking activities have you been involved in and have you used HF to your advantage and learned anything?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] The extent of my 'hacking' was pretty much rats and keyloggers. I did it because I could and I thought it was cool that I was able to do it. After awhile though I just got bored with it. I never got involved with anything highly illegal (fraud, etc.) and never desired to. I did, however, take my knowledge from HF to build my IT skillset. I'll actually be attending a national web-design competition next week.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] I see you have been posting in the newest sub-forum here on HF, [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=318]Vices[/url]. How do you feel about this new section on the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] Vices came as a surprise to me. Omni had said multiple times he would not make a drug sub-forum. I think it's a good addition to the site as it gets all of the weed threads out of the lounge and gives people a place to talk about that sort of thing. I think if it's heavily moderated and posts stay high quality that it'll be a good section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] I agree and am happy to see the new area as well. Do you have any vices of your own or any thoughts on those who do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] I smoke, (ciggarettes) but that's about it. Personally, I feel that people can do whatever they want to themselves as long as it doesn't hurt others. But some people just let things just go too far.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] You recently posted a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4253107]thread[/url] ranting about how much the customers at the major retailer you work for really get on your nerves. Do the customers really upset you that much and have you thought about finding a new job?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] On a day-to-day basis it isn't that bad as most of the customers are pleasant and easy to work with. That thread just highlighted the worst of the job, without really talking about the good half. I had a good offer at a networking solutions company near me but they weren't able to work with my college schedule. For now I think I'll be sticking with the retailer. I'd also like to highlight this rant above all the others: Yes, it [i]is[/i] a big deal to give you $20 in $1 bills.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Retail is a tough environment to work in, that's for sure. What's the story on your national web design contest you're going to be competing in next week?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I can't give a whole lot of information due to keeping my identity somewhat private. My team (my friend and I) competed in the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America, which is a high school organization) web design contest. The contest is based on both the design and the presentation. We did extremely well at the state competition and we're preparing our site and presentation for nationals now. I'd also highly recommend that anyone who is reading this and is still in high school join the FBLA. There are a lot of competitive events relating to computers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] If everything works out in your favor we could quite possibly see you leaving your cashiering job very soon. How active do you think you'll remain on HF once your career starts going?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] My activity has actually lowered quite a bit since around 2012-2013. I don't post much anymore except for in the groups I'm in. I think I'll hang around HF for a few more years to come but I don't know if I'll ever pick back up in activity.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] That seems to happen quite often with a lot of members. Do you have any goals you'd still like to achieve on the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] Not necessairly. I'll be hitting 5,000 posts and 500 reputation pretty soon. I'm not a super-user but I think that's a pretty good milestone for me. I'd like to get a rare-award sometime, but we'll see. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Is there anything we did not discuss that you would like to touch upon as we bring this interview to a close?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] Not really but thank you for taking the time to interview me for this edition! 200 is a huge milestone and I would like to thank everyone that was and is on the news team for the great work.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] You're welcome. I wish you good luck in your future endeavors and it was nice chatting with you today.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=720138][color=#EFEFEF][b]Predator:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to welcome anyone with questions regarding FBLA to send me a [url=http://hackforums.net/private.php?action=send&uid=720138]PM[/url] and I can give you a better explanation and link you to some great resources. Anyway, as my good friend [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752]Hexicidal[/url] would say: [i]See you starside[/i].\n[/spoiler]",

A binary file stores plain text passwords locally. This file can be downloaded easily by connecting via TCP to port 49152. An HTTP GET request with the parameters \"GET /PSBlock\" to port 49152 will retrieve this document containing remote administrative details which can be used for further access to the router. An estimation of over 31,000 machines are currently vulnerable to this attack. Crafted queries on http://ShodanHQ.com will yield an abundance of vulnerable machines.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Domino's Pizza and Possible Blackmail[/color][/b]\r\nA group of French hackers allegedly retrieved the database of a Domino's Pizzeria stored on French and Belgian websites. They contacted Domino's asking for £30,000 (roughly 51,000 USD) by Monday, June 16 while threatening to leak the databases comprised which were composed of the phone numbers, addresses, emails, and passwords of 600,000 Domino's members. Domino's refused to play along with the malicious games of the hackers and did not pay them. The hackers did not release the database which they may not have even obtained in the first place.\r\n\r\n[i]\"Nothing happened. Nothing. Once the franchise learned of the breach, they patched it up and contacted all of their online customers. Because there was no financial data involved, it boiled down to the mere inconvenience of having to change a pizza-ordering password.\"[/i] - Domino's Spokesman\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Hackers Reverse-Engineer National Security Agency’s Spy Kit[/color][/b]\r\nDue to Edward Snowden's leak of the National Security Agency’s (NSA) Advanced Network Technology catalog, hackers have been steadily working with Software Defined Radios (SDR), among other tools, with the hopes of reverse-engineering numerous tools used by the NSA for spying purposes by capturing, replicating, and dissecting its radio frequencies. A lot of the devices on the catalog can be easily recreated and the parts are readily available with little cost. One of the many devices that can be created is capable of recording and transmitting data from a personal computer. These devices may not be as small as the NSA's, but they’re just as efficient.\r\n\r\n[i]\"Showing how these devices exploit weaknesses in our systems means we can make them more secure in the future.\"[/i] - Michael Ossmann\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Over $620,000 in Dogecoin Mined on Hijacked Machines[/color][/b]\r\nDogecoin, a meme-based Cryptocurrency, was mined on a collection of malware-infected storage devices. The hacker accumulated over $620,000 in two months from mining on these hijacked machines. Tracing the Dogecoins to the hacker was not an easy task. However, Dell's SecureWorks security division was able to gather information on the hacker based on the hacker's username and Github account. As Cryptocurrencies continue to grow and become more prominent, hackers will continue to produce malware to target them.\r\n\r\n[i]\"To date, this incident is the single most profitable, illegitimate mining operation.\"[/i] - Pat Litke\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Largest DDoS Attack Ever in the History of the Internet[/color][/b]\r\nThe largest Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in the history of the internet hit Hong Kong's democracy voting website with the power of 300+ gigabits per second which completely disabled the website. The hacker used a network of compromised computers to attack the website. Matthew Prince, the co-founder and CEO of CloudFlare, stated that the DDoS attack was \"one of the largest and most persistent.\" Hackers are proving that there's no limit to what they can do.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Gm7w7ET.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=255459]Delirium™[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2064999]Kamzare[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Android Ransomware Decrypted by a Student[/color][/b]\r\nRussian hackers have proved themselves to be noteworthy when it comes to blackhat applications, specifically malware. One of the malware masterpieces, SimpLocker, has been targeting Android cellphones located in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, India, Russia, as well as other countries. SimpLocker's functionality is simple but extremely malevolent; it encrypts one's SD card using an AES algorithm and demands the ransom of 21 USD in order for the victim to be provided with a decryption key to regain access to his/her files. To protect the identities of the men behind the curtain, SimpLocker is using the TOR network for the transmission of data between the attacker and the victim. The data transmitted contain sensitive information such as the cellphone's IMEI, its OS version, and the cellphone manufacturer.\r\n\r\nAfter a static and dynamic analysis of the malicious application's code, a student of Sussex University has found a way to cure an infected device by studying the decryption method of the ransomware. The cure of SimpLocker can be found [url=http://securehoney.net/code/SimplelockerAntidote.java]here[/url]. It's free to use by any person who has fallen a victim to the aforementioned malware.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]NullCrew Hacktivists Arrested by FBI[/color][/b]\r\nA U.S. citizen named Timothy French has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly being involved in cyber attacks that targeted universities, corporations, and government departments. As law enforcement officials have stated, information has been collected regarding a number of universities and companies that have been targeted by NullCrew Hacktivists. After processing the collected information, officials have came to the conclusion that in several attacks, the amount of stolen data was enormous with thousands of credentials being published all throughout the internet. The arrested hacker has been hiding under numerous nicknames such as \"Orbit,\" \"crysis,\" and \"c0rps3.\" To conclude, officials have also mentioned that the aforementioned people have been planning their attacks using online services such as Twitter and Skype.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that Timothy French is found guilty of committing computer fraud, he is facing a sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250.000.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]2012 RCE Bug - An Ongoing Exploitation Act[/color][/b]\r\nAccording to Trend Micro, an IT security company, the RCE bug (which was found back in April 2012) has been named as the most common exploit used when it comes to remote code execution. The exploit has been targeting Windows' common controls and it is known to impact a considerable amount of software. However, it most prominently impacts Microsoft Office. The RCE bug enables the attacker to execute malicious code by using modified Office documents which are spread, in most cases, through e-mail messages. The most common reason for a machine to be exploitable using the RCE bug is the fact that a lot of users tend to leave their computer software non-updated. A security analyst who works for Trend Micro has also reported that exploited machines have a plethora of information stolen. Namely usernames, passwords, network information, system architecture details, and proxy settings.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/TvznEMg.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center]\r\n[b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Cruise Makes Your Car Driverless[/color][/b]\r\nEveryone knows about Google’s self-driving car, but a startup called Cruise has taken the concept of self-driving cars to a whole new level. If you already have your dream car and want a cure for your laziness, this is for you. Cruise allows you to turn your current car into a self-driving machine. Cruise consists of roof-mounted sensors and a series of actuators that control the pedals and steering mechanisms. The control system is located in the trunk, and to turn on this bad boy you simply press a button installed on the dash. However, Cruise can’t be called a perfect autonomous driving system yet, as currently it is more like an improved cruise control. Currently, the tech is only set to work in the San Francisco Bay area and is only compatible with Audi’s A4s and S4s. The estimated price for this device will be $10,000, and if Cruise keeps on improving the device, it will be well worth it.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Google Glass Goes On Sale Outside The US[/color][/b]\r\nGoogle Glass has exploded since its release and it is obvious people want it around the globe. Luckily, Google finally started shipping Google Glass outside of the United States. There have been tons of orders already within the past 24 hours, so there is a chance it will be sold out. Currently only the Explorer Edition is available for purchase outside of the United States, and has a hefty price tag of £1,000. You can choose your own Glass color, and Google throws in a free color change for your frame to make your Google Glass more unique. The most downloaded app currently for the Google Glass overseas is The Guardian newspaper, and there are plenty of other apps being downloaded at this moment specifically for the Google Glass. Here in America, Google is working on improving the performance of the device. So far, Google has added more RAM to the latest Google Glass model and Google is using the feedback from customers to improve their smart eyewear.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Amazon Announces The Fire Phone[/color][/b]\r\nAmazon has announced their first phone. The Fire is priced at $199 and comes with a unique feature never seen before in other smartphones. The Fire has dynamic perspective, meaning the phone redraws 3D images so you can look underneath icons on the screen. The Fire has four IR cameras that have a large field of view, allowing the dynamic perspective to work flawlessly. The Fire was built for Amazon’s Prime subscribers and Amazon is ensuring personalized support for The Fire. A feature that seems to be the most interesting, however, is Firefly. Firefly is a built-in application that allows the user to purchase items instantly that are found around them. Firefly is definitely going to boost Amazon’s marketing department, and many people can’t wait to use the feature.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Moto 360 Smartwatch Shows Up At Google I/O[/color][/b]\r\nWhile smart watches are a new thing, it seems every company is trying to jump into the world of wearable tech.

At Google I/O, they gave out a nondescript cardboard box, and were very vague about what was inside. It turns out that the box was a DIY VR set. According to Google, you can use household materials to make it. All you need is your phone and a rubberband. Google includes a link to where to get other parts of the headset, as well as an SDK. Google's hope is to make virtual reality a real thing for as many people as possible, and with this they pretty much have. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Verizon Backpedaling After Cutting LTE for Chromebook Pixel Users[/color][/b]\r\nVerizon has run into another PR nightmare, with the latest involving their free LTE they offered to owners of the Chromebook Pixel. Verizon initially cut off the LTE for unspecified reasons, then Google stepped in offering a $150 gift card, and everyone got mad at Verizon. Verizon brushed it off initially, until they realized that this wouldn't stop, so they reversed the decision and issued this statement: \"We do understand that a very small number of Chromebook Pixel customers may have had a promo end prematurely,\" a spokesperson said to news outlet TechCrunch. \"We apologize for this, and will work with these customers to address the situation.\" It seems that Verizon might have plans to reinstate the free LTE, but the statement was very vague. If they don't, more outrage will be sure to follow.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/HeflzKQ.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1030620]CyborgIzSoBeast[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Conan visits E3 2014[/color][/b]\r\nTV funnyman Conan O'Brien who is known to be clueless about video games (which he admits himself) decided to vist E3 2014 which turned out to be great choice to cover last week's E3.

He is currently seeking a meeting with German officials to testify about American wrongdoings. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/gREoxaa.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768]SomeWhiteGuy[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152]Vazity[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Overstock Promoting Bitcoin with 3% of Profits Made[/color][/b]\nAccording to Patrick Bryne, CEO of Overstock, within the next two decades people will forget that we use any currency other than bitcoins. Overstock began accepting bitcoins earlier this year, and to the surprise of many, profits exceeded $1.6 million in bitcoin related transactions. Last Saturday, Bryne announced that 3% of the bitcoin profits will be donated to organizations that are actively trying to promote bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Overstock was the first big company to accept bitcoin (followed by DISH and Expedia), and they even plan on paying their employees bonuses in bitcoin.\n\n[b][color=white]GENERcoin: Green Renewable Energy Backed by Cryptocurrency[/color][/b]\nWe are all aware of the terrible affects that burning fossil fuels has on our environment; many climatologists agree that we have passed the \"point of safe return\" in this matter. There is a Canadian company based out of British Columbia that is attempting to solve the problems that burning fossil fuels creates: a truly renewable fuel that does not use food products such as corn. As a way to promote the fuel that this company is creating, they have created a new cryptocurrency that they will use to \"pre-sell\" the new biofuel. Investors of the company will be allowed to purchase GENERcoins at the exchange and use them to trade for other cryptocurrencies, or to buy the new fuel at a 51% discount to current market prices. The coin was initially selling for $0.062/coin, equivalent to 10,000 BTU (British thermal unit) which included the discounted rate. The coin holders now have the options of either redeeming their coins for the fuel in exchange, or trading them as they see fit.\n\n[b][color=white]BurnerCoin: The New Altcoin Specifically for Motorsports[/color][/b]\nMotorsport and cryptocurrencies have always been good friends; like those two kids you knew in grade school that just couldn't get enough of each other. Recently, a new altcoin called BurnerCoin, has set out to make itself the new emblem of the motorsports industry. The developer doesn't seem like he wants to waste any time about this, either. Considerable publicity and an excited community back this coin already. One more thing that tends to be luring people into the fire is the 5% annual dividend that is offered to coin holders. You can read more about the coin on www.burnercoin.biz.\n\n[color=white][b]Western Union may use Bitcoin[/b][/color]\nThe chief executive officer of Western Union Hikmet Ersek said that Western Union is open to the thought of using Bitcoin if it is regulated as a currency. When asked about the potential threat from Bitcoin which is a far cheaper way to move value around the world, particularly considering Western Unions pricing, Hikmet Ersek argued that, if Western Unions service was too costly, people would not use it. While it may seem promising that the company would consider adopting the digital currency in its portfolio, the actual fact remains that Bitcoin is unregulated in most countries, and is not anywhere thought of as a currency.\n\n[color=white][b]Darkcoin Battles Setback[/b][/color]\nDarkcoin has suffered new setbacks stemming from the launch of its 'masternode' system for guaranteeing anonymous transactions, with the rollout requiring multiple hard forks and a rework of the deployment strategy. The masternodes act as transaction bundlers and mixers, preventing network actors from discerning the origin and destination of transactions among the network. This feature, called DarkSend, incentivizes masternode participation through a dividend-like payment system.\n\n[color=white][b]California's Bill to make Digital Currency Lawful[/b][/color]\nCalifornia Assembly Bill 129, a bill that may make digital currencies lawful within the US state, will now head to the desk of California Governor Jerry Brown wherever it'll need final approval to become law. Assembly Bill 129, authoried by Assembly Member Roger Dickinson, would acknowledge digital currencies, together with a bunch of alternative forms of value including points and coupons, as lawful alternatives to the United States Dollar. The state-backed currency would still have legal superiority, as Californian reisdents are not required to accept forms of lawful money.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/2jDDr3o.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871421]Ty ™[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]New Way of Investing[/color][/b]\nInvesting in companies has been going on since the eighteenth century, but now people are now investing into certain items that increase in value over time. Some examples of this are rare coins, comic books, toys etc, but the new thing to invest in are liquids like scotch and other types of liquor. People instead of drinking there scotch are now holding onto it as an investment and receiving high returns. Statistics show that if you would of invested in one of the top 500 preforming bottles that were in auction in 2008 and then sold in 2013, you would of made a profit of at least 250%. As it seems right now these prices are going to go higher and higher because the demographic and pop culture, more people are now growing up on whiskey instead of vodka.\n\n[b][color=white]Massive Airbag Recall[/color][/b]\nMazda, BMW, Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Toyata and Nissan will be recalling hundreds of thousands of cars because of faulty airbags. The government started investigating after reports of strange occurrences of airbags rupturing. If an incident occurred, the airbags might not deploy correctly leading to injury. All of these airbags were supplied by the Japanese company called Takata, statistics are not confirmed at this time, but it is an estimated 1.1 million U.S. cars will be affected. Most of the recalls have been limited to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was limited to these areas because of the hot and humid weather.\n\n[b][color=white]Google Domain Registration Service[/color][/b]\nGoogle plans on putting their data center to work to help you register your own domain.

This is the first study to show the interaction between the immune system and invading bacteria in which the bacteria can counter the immune system by evolving quickly. Now that scientists know exactly how the bacteria evades the immune system, they can begin research on medicine to either stop the bacteria from evolving or allow the immune system to discover the bacteria even after it mutates.\n\n[b][color=white]Family Violence Leaves Genetic Imprints on Children[/color][/b]\nA new study from the Tulane University School of Medicine found that children in more violent homes are more likely to have their DNA scarred. Researchers found that children in homes of violence, suicide, and incarcerations have significantly shorter telomores. Telomores are a cellular marking for aging. Shorter telomores are often linked to higher risks for heart disease, obesity, cognitive decline, diabetes and mental illness. Researchers got this information by taking genetic samples from 85 children and then interviewing them and their family about home environment and their lifestyles. \n\n[b][color=white]New Invisibility Cloak prevents objects from being touched[/color][/b]\nEver since Harry Potter has shown off invisibility cloak, scientists have tried to replicate such a cloak to certain senses. In the past, objects were hidden from heat, light, and sound from various invisibility cloaks. Researchers at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology have discovered a certain metamaterial that shields objects from being touched. By surrounding said object in a cavity, the object will be untouchable because of the crystalline material directing the forces of the touching finger away. Although the cloak so far can cover few volumes, KIT researchers are looking for further implementation of this metamaterial on larger objects.\n\n[b][color=white]Menthol Cigarettes Become Popular Among Teenagers[/color][/b]\nRecently, young smokers have been attracted toward menthol cigarettes. These menthol cigarettes previously appealed to the younger crowd because of fewer negative externalities, but researchers are the University of Waterloo say that the risk of developing lung cancer is just as prevalent in menthol cigarettes and non-menthol cigarettes. In fact, researchers found that those who smoked menthol cigarettes were 33% more likely to continue smoking. Also, those who smoked menthol cigarettes smoked more than those who didn't, and this is because of the minty flavor in menthol cigarettes. This poses a huge problem for the government and their previous efforts on reducing the nicotine addiction rates among the youth.\n\n[b][color=white]Breakthrough in Ovarian Cancer Treatment[/color][/b]\nDoctors from the University of Arizona Cancer Center at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center recently unveiled the usage of trebananib in patients. Trebananib serves a catalyst for growth of blood vessels in cancerous tumors, allowing for faster recuperation time for cancer patients with immature tumors. This allows for tumor shrinkage and slows the rate at which cancerous cells reproduce. Trebananib does not increase the risk of hypertension, which previously was a problem for substances that sought to shrink tumors. Although Ovarian Cancer is still largely fatal, doctors hope to use this research to inhibit tumor growth rates and give patients a longer and less painful lifespan.

A new technology known as Neurobridge can learn to decode neural impulses and transmit them to a muscle-stimulating sleeve around the patient's disabled limbs. This implant allows motor communication to reroute itself around the injured area, restoring some brain-muscle coordination. So far the new technology has been tested on only one patient, Ian Burkhart, a 23-year-old quadriplegic from Ohio. The trial showed promising results, and now four more potential patients are scheduled to receive the implant.\n\n[color=white] [b]Test strategy to cure infants for HIV.[/b][/color]\nBack in 2013, the announcement of a baby's HIV miraculously getting  cured of HIV hit The New England Journal of Medicine fast, with hopes that other babies could be cured the exact same way. Just after 30 hours of birth, the baby began treatment for HIV, however, the mixture of drugs used on the baby was stopped roughly when the child was 18 months of age. Even after treatment was stopped, the baby's blood plasma showed no sign of the virus. The baby is currently more than three years of age and living a perfectly fine, HIV free life. How the child beat the virus is still a mystery to a handful of doctors.\n\nThis is where the US national institute of health comes in. They plan on getting 54 babies, all HIV positive, and do the exact same protocols as on the Mississippi baby, to try and reach the same results. Within the first 48 hours of their birth, they will begin heavy treatment to cure the HIV early on. Doctors wonder, if this success rate is high, could this be the change we have looking for? Could this be the starting point of an HIV free world?  \n\n[color=white] [b]Adults suffering from Asperger Syndrome - Higher suicide rate? [/b]  [/color]\nA newly released, British study shows adults who have the milder form of Autism known as Asperger Syndrome are more likely to contemplate suicide than those in the general population. The survey of 374 British adults revealed that 66% reported having suicidal thoughts and 35% have actually planned or attempted suicide. Those with Asperger Syndrome along with depression were FOUR times more likely to think about suicide and twice as likely to plan or attempt suicide, compared to those who do not have any form of depression, at all.\n\n[b][color=white]Mapping Illnesses[/color][/b]\nUsing DNA and protein mapping combined with 15 years worth of health records from over 6 million Danes, researchers have attempted to map the progression of multiple diseases across an entire population. The map shows strong correlations between diseases that were once thought to be unrelated, such as gout and cardiovascular disease. The goal is to develop a list of trends which will allow medical professionals to forecast an individual's health and make it easier to develop individualized treatment plans. The researchers believe that this will allow for improved health care while reducing costs.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]",

On June 24th, she was given a sentence for two years in prison. She agreed to pay back what she stole, which was over $180,000 of online purchases. The credit card was owned by Sandra Hernandez, the wife of Mariner' starter Felix Hernandez. As of today, Carlos Peguero is no longer on the Mariners, but on the Royals. \"I doubt that Maria is going to Leavenworth over this, but if she becomes a problem inmate and gets shipped there for some reason, she’ll be less than a three hour drive away,\" he said about the situation.\n\n[b][color=white]LeBron James Losing His Flames?[/color][/b]\nWith all bad puns aside, 29 year old small forward and power forward, LeBron James says he's interested in becoming a free agent and leaving the Miami Heat. With the player market being flooding by different free agents, LeBron James is definitely going to be a top pick for some teams. On July 1st, he will be on the market looking for a new team to play on. The team confirmed that this isn't a hoax and that LeBron is walking away from his two years and $42.7 million contract with the Heat. Of course the president of the Heat is trying his best to keep LeBron on the team; he is also trying to pick up Carmelo Anthony. Given such, the L.A. Lakers have had their eyes on LeBron. With Steve Nash's contract expiration coming up soon, this will give enough money for the team to purchase LeBron and Carmelo. Will LeBron and Melo join forces with Kobe? Will the Bulls pick up LeBron this year? The Bulls certainly had interest in the young star back in 2010. Does Pat Riley (president of the Miami Heat) have what it takes to keep LeBron in Miami? Only time will tell.\n\n[b][color=white]Questionable Behavior by Luis Suarez[/color][/b]\nAs the World Cup continues to go on in Brazil, there have been very exciting games where fans were up on their feet cheering and cheering for their favorite team and where fans were caught in shock and awe. A notable game was definitely the most recent: Uruguay vs. Italy. This match definitely sparked some interest. Nine to ten minutes before the match ended, Uruguay's forward, Luis Suarez, bit Italy's defender, Giorgio Chiellini, on the shoulder. A replay of the event shows Suarez grabbing his teeth while Chiellini lays on the pitch in pain. Surprisingly enough, the referees did not send Suarez off the pitch for his actions. Suarez and Chiellini were both inside the penalty area and were close enough to each other for Suarez to take a bite. Afterwards, both of them fell to the ground. While this was happening, Chiellini clenched onto his shoulder as he was in pain. Suarez's motive was most likely to stop Italy from getting the ball and helping Uruguay to score a goal. Suarez, the man caught red handed, was seen holding his teeth indicating that he actually bit him. This is not the first time that Suarez has bitten a player. He has bitten PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal and Chelsea's Branislov Ivanovic. This action could possibly get the team suspended from the World Cup or even getting Suarez banned from playing the next match. Many articles online suggest something be done of this, but no actions have been taken. Chiellini tried his best to show the referee the bite marks and the damage done, but Rodriguez (referee) decided not to pull out the yellow or red card. Chiellini was reported to have said, \"He bit me, he bit me!\" There was a clip of the match where you could see Chiellini running to the ref showing the marks, but instead, Rodriquez kept the foul cards in his pockets and told everyone to continue the match. Uruguay eventually won this game against Italy 1-0, when Diego Godín (Uruguay) scored a header at the 81' minute. It definitely sparked some controversy and has been reported on various different news channels as of June 24th, 2014.\n\n[b][color=white]The End to a Dynasty Has Come.[/color][/b]\n\"The end.\" Never have two words been so fitting to depict the beginning of another era. It was the end of a rule of supremacy that the rugby legaue might never again witness, the end of NSW's hopelessness, and likewise the end of NSW's quest for a No.7 with Trent Hodkinson noting the calls for a guardian angel, scoring the series winning tryand goal to send ANZ Stadium into roar after a vital 6-4 win. He ran once in game one and furthermore for 71 minutes in game two, he'd again just test the line on one event. It was an instance of third time fortunate for the tough Bulldogs playmaker, dummying his route past Ben Te'o and Daly Cherry-Evans to take his spot in Origin fables. Hodkinson then showed nerves of steel to slot the conversion to give NSW an anticipated victory. Surprisingly, since July 6, 2005, the state of NSW can, at long last, say they finished QLD's 8 year dominance of State of Origin. It was the script to what Queensland tall tales are made of: injuries, uncertainties, and the underdog tag. At the same time, the Blues held their nerve in the last stages to seal a memorable win.\n\n[b][color=white]LeBron Crosby: NHL's Most Valuable Player[/color][/b]\nSidney Crosby, the Pittsburgh Penguins skipper, has won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player. It is Crosby's second Hart Trophy and fourth nomination. Ryan Getzlaf of the Anaheim Ducks and Claude Giroux of the Philadelphia Flyers were the runner ups. Crosby had 36 goals, 68 assists, and an 18 rating in 80 regular season games. Pittsburgh was wiped out for the post-season in the Eastern Conference elimination rounds, losing to the New York Rangers in seven games.\nCrosby was additionally perceived by his peers for the second year in succession when he took home the Ted Lindsay Award as the most oustanding player in the NHL as He was then voted by individual parts of the NHL Players' Association at the league's awards show on Tuesday. Crosby demolished Anaheim Ducks skipper Ryan Getzlaf and Philadelphia Flyers skipper Claude Giroux for the honor throughout the function held at Encore Theater in the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\n[b][color=white] Curt Schilling Announces His Cancer's Remission.[/color][/b]\nBack in February, we learned that the long-time big league right-hander, Curt Schilling, had been diagnosed with cancer.

The reason for such a long process comes from the accuracy needed from the lasers to remove the grime that has built up over the decades of an industrializing Greece. Acid rain and air pollution are the main culprits. The laser cleans only about a square millimeter of each statue at a time and such must be carefully monitored. Some areas were considered especially harder than others based on the thickness of the grime and required more care. The care shown to these statues displays the respect that modern people still have for their ancient culture. The statues can currently be see and appreciated in the Acropolis Museum located in Athens, Greece.\n\n[b][color=white]A Brief Explanation of Friday the 13th[/color][/b]\nThis year, Friday the 13th landed in June with a full moon and some people will inevitably question such an odd \"holiday.\" The origins of Friday the 13th can only be found in western culture and have been amplified by a certain movie featuring Jason Voorhees. The most-likely reason for the embracement of this superficial holiday by westerners may come from Judas (a betrayer of Jesus) being the 13th guest at the last supper followed by Jesus being then crucified on a Friday. The combination of these two coincidences gives us Friday the 13th. This day, however, can not considered \"all bad.\" People tend to act safer in the threat of perceived danger as it has been studied and therefore this special Friday can lead to a more cautious population. Keep that in mind and hopefully no masked murderer will come for you in the night.\n\n[b][color=white]25th Anniversary of the Rebellion in Tiananmen Square[/color][/b]\nOn the night of June 3rd, 1989, the sounds of gunfire could be heard at Tiananmen Square. During the previous days before this night, one could see thousands of protesters (many being students) across the area calling for less corruption and a more pro-democratic government. The exact number of deaths from this evening still has yet to be released by the Chinese government and even attempting to gain footage of the square is nearly impossible. Not all is lost however; President Xi Jinping has promised reforms against corruption of the communist party and claims the corruption itself to be the party's biggest enemy. He has already begun cracking down on officials taking advantage of their positions of power and the judicial system itself.\n\n[b][color=white]United States President Barack Obama Visits Native American Country[/color][/b]\nPresident Obama took a visit to the Standing Rock Lakota reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota on the day of June 13, 2014. During his visit, the president addressed the problems surrounding the experience of Native Americans in the United States as well as taking part in some of the Native American's Flag Day celebratory practices. This visit was president Obama's first since taking office in 2009 as well as the first presidential visit to a Native American reservation since Bill Clinton's visit to the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in 1999. Obama took a visit to the Crow reservation in Montana before his becoming president. Also during his visit, Obama and his wife Michelle took the time to meet with twenty students. One of the students described their experience as a \"powerful\" one and felt as though they were inspired to be themselves.\n\n[b][color=white]Guatemalan Communities Organize Protests and Roadblocks on a National Level[/b][/color]\nOn the day of June 24, 2014, indigenous people and groups from all throughout Guatemala took part in national protests and roadblocks to shed light on the continued injustice and discrimination faced by the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. Among the main priorities on the list of causes for protest were the discriminatory telecommunication laws as well as the mining and hydroelectric companies exploiting indigenous territories. The march in Xela began at eight in the morning from three different entry points into the center of the city. The three groups would all meet for a much larger demonstration in the Central Park of the city later that morning. Hundreds upon hundreds of indigenous people participated in the protests and roadblocks. It was clear that they have had enough.\n\n[b][color=white]Nelson Mandela Leaves Behind Estate of $4.1 Million to Family and Acquaintances[/b][/color]\nSouth African anti-apartheid hero and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, Nelson Mandela, left around 46 million rand, which is around $4.1 million in U.S. money, in assets to the members of his family, former staff, many schools, and the ruling party of South Africa, according to his will executors.

Ha! I will miss the Minecraft news, as \nthat was the way I found out about Minecraft in the first place, \nand I followed the snapshots and updates ever since by reading \nthat section. I've also followed tech news, reading what's new and \nwhat's being invented. The security tip of the week and so on. \nThey always inspire me to research a bit more ability whatever \ninterests me more! Same thing with the science section, I always \nlove to check out the new things in the science community. \nScience has always been a big thing for me and thats's why it's \none of my favorite sections. I guess I also like the general user \nnews and headlines. That way, we know whats's up in the forum. \nThere are a lot of great threads mentioned, some funny and \nothers no quite so much, but they are entertaining. You can \nalways learn something new!\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1376915][i]-Sweeth Belle McCartney[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"The HF news is an easy way to catch up with what's been \nhappening on HF and out and around too, if you miss anything, \ngroup news, user news, headlines stuff, further to gaming news, \nbusiness news etc. HF news is an easy place to catch up with the \nweek's events, making it convenient to see what's been going on \nin one place.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1205532][i]-Robust[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"Just like anyone else, I read the news to get caught up on hack \nforums news and other news.

I love reading peoples opinions \non topics which Sir provides to us each week.
