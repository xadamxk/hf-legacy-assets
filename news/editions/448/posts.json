Mike Maslowski, a retired salesman, is a conservative retiree who is cautious about his spending and that of his family to maintain a comfortable life. Expenses should offer the required contentment without sacrificing such important issues like the health of the individual. It is also important to invest the savings to earn more and minimize the risks encountered in retirement. The recommended withdrawal rate is 4 percent of their savings annually, which is currently not adhered to by the majority of American retirees.

This is in order for Facebook Inc. to increase its revenue streams by assisting businesses to market their goods and services as well as send relevant information to the customers via messaging services. One-hundred companies are already using the paid platform but Facebook Inc. has not reported any revenues yet, with the business venture set to be launched in the coming weeks.

Through its CEO, Kevin Johnston, the company has demonstrated a major contribution to the U.S service members by offering employment and setting up coffee stores around military camps. Through this, they improve the lives of the vets and their family members. They also offer a transitioning program for the vets to get back to normal life. Starbucks follows in the efforts of other companies, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Home Depot and Southwest Airlines that continue to create jobs for American veterans and military spouses.

The breakdown for the feat comes out to around 390 million copies in print in Japan, with the remaining 70 million copies being sold abroad. Having crossed the 450 million mark just earlier this year in March, it will mean a more than ten million-copy increase in just nine months. [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/11/06/one-piece-manga-to-surpass-460-million-copies-printed-worldwide-next-month]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Shueisha Says Female Jump Editors Need to \"Understand the Hearts of Boys\"[/color][/b]\r\nLast week, a tweet posted by an anonymous Twitter user sparked additional discussion surrounding the topic of gender discrimination at Shueisha. They spoke of the company visiting their university and, when asked \"Can women become editors at Shonen Jump?,\" an HR representative allegedly responded by saying It's not without precedent, but you have to understand the hearts of boys.\" [i]Huffington Post Japan[/i] reached out to the company following this revelation and got the following response: \"...It is not unprecedented. There are women at Jump+, and publications like Young Jump have had female editors in the past. Women's fashion magazines need people who understand women's fashion regardless of gender, so for a shonen manga it's important to understand the hearts of boys...\" The publication [Huffington Post Japan] notes that Shueisha did not actually make it clear whether women can become editors at [i]Weekly Shonen Jump[/i]. [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2019-11-08/shueisha-says-female-jump-editors-need-to-understand-the-hearts-of-boys/.152995]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]The Seven Deadly Sins: Wrath of the Gods Continues to Leave Fans Unimpressed[/color][/b]\r\nThe situation surrounding the currently airing season of [i]The Seven Deadly Sins[/i] has been dire since even before it began airing. [i]Aniplex[/i] bailed from production after last Fall's film side-story under-performed, leaving the season to be inevitably picked up by [i]Studio Deen[/i] who, while now having taken over the primary \"production\" role, has outsourced the majority of the work to [i]March Jack[/i]¹. This led fans to almost expect the season to be a train-wreck, though some additional unexpected issues have arisen since the first episode originally aired². Once a series well known for its blood and gore, [i]The Seven Deadly Sins: Wrath of the Gods[/i] has decided to drop that entirely: opting to lazily cover any significant injury or body part with a black shadow and whiting out blood in its entirety. Animation in the opening is almost non-existent, with most of the sequence containing stills. Non-existing animation has been a reoccurring complaint as episodes are released week by week. The recent episode five left fans again wondering, as a series of extended frames had Meliodas's facial proportions completely off, not to mention a general lack of attention to detail³. It may be too early to [i]officially[/i] call this season of [i]The Seven Deadly Sins[/i] a bust, but things definitely aren't looking up.

With dynamic Mars in the last degrees of your sector of relating, this can be a time to resolve any partnership or relationship issues before your focus shifts next week. \r\n\r\nThe emphasis is still very much on shared assets and business matters, as well as deep soul bonds. And with talkative Mercury rewinding in this zone, it’s necessary that you exercise caution when dealing with large amounts of money or sensitive issues. Things may seem clear-cut on the surface, but perhaps they aren’t as they appear. \r\n\r\nTuesday’s full moon across your financial axis might encourage you to splurge or indulge in other ways. If tempted to do so, ask yourself what you really need, and feel the answer in your heart chakra. This is where you will likely find satisfaction. In general, avoid rushing into anything. Take your time.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"You may have a few questions about key business or romance relationships this week. However, the answers may not give you as much clarity as you’d like. Much as you try to pinpoint the source of the issue, it could shift and change, leaving you none the wiser.\r\n\r\nThe full moon in your sign on Tuesday could amp up the feelings in a key relationship. If you’re newly in love, this essential aspect could encourage you to take things to the next level. Feelings might override logic, though, so be sure this is the right way forward for you. If you try to hold on to someone, they may take several steps back. \r\n\r\nThere is the potential for ideas and decisions to shift and change as an aspect involving nebulous Neptune and Mercury retrograde comes to the fore. Still, an adventurous Mars-Jupiter tie could see you eager to pool resources with someone in a business venture. Don’t rush into anything!\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"As warrior Mars continues to power through the last degrees of your leisure sector, there is still time to have fun. However, with the planets spread across other sectors, you’ll also be busy with your everyday routines, key relationships, and financial and business affairs. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, there is a full moon in a more spiritual sector, so it might be wise to lighten your schedule if you can. A full moon can bring on some drama and heightened feelings, which could make for an edgy day. It might help if you can take a step back. \r\n\r\nWith convivial Mercury continuing its retrograde phase, though, it pays to be extra careful at work, particularly because this unpredictable planet aligns with ethereal Neptune midweek. This isn’t the best time to sign agreements or contracts because things may not be quite as they seem. The cosmos encourages you to do your research and dig deep before getting involved in any schemes, no matter how good they appear.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=3]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3399ff]Cancer ♋[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With the sun continuing its journey through your romance zone, along with chatty Mercury in its rewind phase, this could be an interesting week. You may have plans, but current influences suggest that things might not work out as expected. Be prepared for a detour. \r\n\r\nTuesday’s full moon across your social axis can be perfect for a fun get-together or perhaps a bigger occasion. And with this full moon taking place in sensual Taurus, it can be an opportunity to indulge. Are you eager to take a romance further? You might find it hard to resist doing so. You could also be mesmerized by someone and perhaps find it hard to get them out of your mind. However, current aspects suggest getting to know the person better before you get too involved. \r\n\r\nStill, a link between the sun and volcanic Pluto can be an opportunity to team up with someone who shares the same passions as you.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Monday’s merger of the sun and retrograde Mercury in your domestic sector could see you reminiscing about aspects of the past. You could find a recipe book that belonged to a family member from long ago and be eager to try some of their ideas. Or perhaps an object or old letter brings up sentimental feelings. \r\n\r\nWhile the focus on your domestic sector looks set to continue over the coming weeks, Tuesday’s full moon could highlight your personal goals and aspirations. This can be an opportunity to bask in the spotlight concerning something recently accomplished. \r\n\r\nPlus, an adventurous Mars-Jupiter tie could be an opportunity to connect with someone regarding a creative idea or other enterprise. You may relish a challenge even if it means taking a leap of faith. \r\n\r\nGo easy on the romance front, though, as a dreamy Venus-Neptune link suggests someone could take advantage of you by encouraging feelings of guilt.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=5]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#339933]Virgo ♍[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With both the sun and dealmaker Mercury in your communication zone, you may be busy with ideas and eager to involve others in exciting discussions. But whatever is decided could change over the coming weeks as the planet of talk and thought continues in reverse mode and angles toward ethereal Neptune. Such influences can be perfect for brainstorming, but with the likelihood of misunderstandings and confusion, it might be unwise to arrange anything that involves a lot of money or is crucial in some other way. \r\n\r\nThe Tuesday Taurus full moon in your sector of travel and adventure could see you yearning for new opportunities or a trip. If something appeals to you, you might think nothing of booking it. The break could do you good. \r\n\r\nAs fiery Mars aligns with jovial Jupiter this week, you may be eager to purchase items that can add a point of interest to your home, as well as amuse and entertain.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"As feisty Mars navigates the last degrees of your sign, this is the time to deal with issues that need to be sorted out. Don’t delay, because you may not be so eager to do it next week when Mars moves into Scorpio. \r\n\r\nEven so, money matters need a lot more care than usual as logical Mercury continues retrograde in this sector. And with a full moon on Tuesday across your financial axis, the urge to splurge could be stronger, too. Try to steer clear of big-ticket items like computers, cars, or entertainment systems, because the deal could go wrong. If you do make a purchase, keep the receipts and paperwork in case there’s a problem. \r\n\r\nThat said, if you want to buy a loved one a special gift to show your affection, it will be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFinally, with luscious Venus, your ruler, in cahoots with dreamy Neptune on Thursday, someone could sweet-talk you into accepting something that isn’t all that good for you.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"There is still time to find closure on issues that may be having an emotional impact. This is your chance to clean the slate and let go of whatever no longer serves you, even if it does mean having some in-depth discussions. With thoughtful Mercury continuing to rewind in your sign, this can be a good time to resolve such matters. However, with dreamy Neptune in the mix, clarity is essential. It would be easy for confusion and misunderstandings to complicate matters. \r\n\r\nWith a full moon in your sector of relating intensifying feelings around Tuesday, it’s also possible that things could come to a head regarding other relationship issues. Are you ready to tell someone how you feel? It could all come out in a rush, especially if you’ve been holding back. \r\n\r\nStill, with the sun linking to potent Pluto, the days ahead can see you making a firm decision and sticking to it.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With the radiant sun in a more secluded sector along with logical Mercury, this is very much a time to step back from life and consider your priorities. What are your goals for the future, and what seems to be holding you back? These are some of the things to consider over the coming weeks. \r\n\r\nWith lively Mercury, your relationship planet, rewinding in your spiritual zone, it wouldn’t be surprising if you met someone from the past. In fact, it could seem positively karmic. \r\n\r\nThe desire to indulge in fantasies could also be strong now, and with a powerful full moon in your lifestyle sector, feelings could get out of hand. If you can lighten your schedule around Tuesday, it will help you more easily navigate through this time. \r\n\r\nFinally, with feisty Mars angling toward expansive Jupiter midweek, a social event could bring a wonderful opportunity your way.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=9]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#663333]Capricorn ♑[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"While you may still be busy with goals, ambitions, and career matters, this can be a good time to tie up loose ends in this regard. If there are steps to take to secure new business or move an idea along, focus on these this week. Next week, you could be more distracted and not so inclined to get organized. \r\n\r\nThe focus on your social sector could inspire you to reach out and connect with those who share your ideas and passions. And with chatty Mercury in its retrograde phase, there is also the possibility of linking with someone from the past. Whether you deliberately organize a reunion or it happens by itself, this can be a great opportunity to reconnect. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, there is a full moon across your social axis that could intensify feelings. This can be great for a social occasion, as well as a special outing or date. Have fun and don’t so anything you might come to regret later.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=10]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#9966ff]Aquarius ♒[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"You may think you know where you’re going in terms of your goals and plans, but nebulous energies could muddy the waters. And with thoughtful Mercury continuing in reverse mode and linking to nebulous Neptune, there is the potential for misunderstandings and mistakes. \r\n\r\nYou might need to commit to plans or sign agreements, but if you do, keep copies of the relevant paperwork in case the terms and conditions change. \r\n\r\nWith a full moon in your home zone on Tuesday, feelings around your work/life balance could come to the fore. However, as they could be amplified at this time, it isn’t a good idea to make any key decisions. Some drama on the home front could detract from certain responsibilities, so if you can lighten your schedule, do so. \r\n\r\nMidweek, a feisty aspect involving dynamic Mars and jovial Jupiter could coincide with the opportunity for a group outing that proves very worthwhile.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=11]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#cccc66]Pisces ♓[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"While this is very much a time to explore new opportunities, it helps to understand your motives for doing so. With hazy Neptune in your sign this week, clarity is essential to progress. As chatty Mercury in its retrograde phase angles toward spiritual Neptune, you could be caught up in dreams or fantasies that might not materialize. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, if someone offers you a sound proposition with some substance, you might not take it. Before making any key decisions, consider talking to a practical and trusted friend who may be able to give you some solid advice. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the full moon across your communication axis can be an emotional one. If there is something you need to talk about, doing so might allow you to shed a few tears, which could be very healing. \r\n\r\nThe message this week is to keep your feet on the ground as you aim for the stars.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Alan Watts \"The Real You\"[/color][/b]\r\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I[/video]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2331053][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/comics-mix.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center]\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 1 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/d0/40/a7d04077c6136669bf20faeb08dc8062.gif[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 2 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/funny-the-square-comics-alvin-juan-fb9__700-png.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 3 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://i2.wp.com/memecell.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Top-15-Funny-Comics-Hilarious-for-Today-14.jpg?fit=564%2C1128&ssl=1[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 4 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/d7/95/20d7956a1ea823f51357cafd861abf2b.gif[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 5 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a9/0a/a8/a90aa8509d6f572af94b008a0b0df3e3.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 6 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://yogaretreats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Only-True-Masters-Of-Yoga-Can-Get-To-That-Point-800x285.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 7 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://lefunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Men-are-Men.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://twitter.com/HFWrit3rs][img]https://www.hackforums.news/assets/v4/twitter.png[/img][/url]\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/HFWrit3rs][b]Follow us on Twitter and get hot Hack Forums news straight to your phone in a timely manner![/b][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color][/size][/font]",
