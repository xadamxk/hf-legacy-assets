Have any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. I would like to make a shoutout to Neil, who has been an amazing friend to me ever since I came back. And I would also like to make a shout out to The Judge and Beta who have been good friends to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Recently, I noticed you've been a great benefactor to HF. What made you decide to donate to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] I decided to donate to Hackforums because I felt like this is something good to invest in. I am financially not gaining anything, but I love to see the site run and see all the members interact with each other. I want these interactions to live on for as long as possible. Money is what Hackforums runs on and that is the only way it will survive. Also Omniscient is a great Owner of the forum. His dedication to the forum is what also made me donate.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] That's very generous of you. You've been a member of HF for a long time. When did you start becoming active?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] I started to become active in July for the most part. I forgot I had the Hackforums account. I was L33T at that time. I wanted to see if I get approved for UB3R, even after being inactive. Surprisingly I did. After I got UB3R, I finally realized I can make a name for myself. That’s when I started to get involved in groups and in the marketplace.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What groups were you apart of? Can you give me your experience with each and one of them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] My first group was L’Appel Du Vide. My experiences in this group are fantastic. I had fun debating and seeing everyone’s views on crucial and controversial topics. This group is a very high quality group with a lot of high quality members. This group is also led by one of my favorite members on Hackforums Hexicidal. I saw Hexicidal a lot back in 2012. I was glad to be apart of his group when I got in. The next group was Instinct. This group was way different. I had fun looking at the Lounge threads they had. Each lounge thread did not last a day. Each thread reached 2000 posts. This was a extremely fun and active group to be apart of. After the fall of Instinct, I decided to buy leadership of Debug. I felt that I can provide some of my knowledge of the marketplace into this group. This group has a lot of potential and has many talented individuals. Lastly, my friend Icy bought Instinct. I decided this group is going to be fun to lead too. I bought leadership and I plan to live on the Instinct Legacy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] That's good to hear! Have you made some new friends while being apart of those groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] Yes indeed. From the Void I met Beta and Happeh. I honestly love talking to them because they are so down to earth. In Instinct I made tons of new friends. We call them the real “OGs”. So shoutout to Meow, The Judge, Justin Timberlake, illuminati, Roger Waters, Axel, and Litecoin. Now I cannot leave out my partners in crime right now. So definitely it is a pleasure to say I am looking forward to working with Nex and Icy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] You recently bought leadership for Instinct. What do you plan on doing as leader?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] For Instinct I plan on making it just the way it was. It was a great group for relaxing and just talking with friends. I plan to do more contests and giveaways. Honestly have not thought about it yet, but I plan to sit down with Icy and make some unique plans for the future.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome! I'm sure a lot of Instinct members are excited about that. Why got you to HF in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] Hack forums was introduced to me while playing on a Minecraft server to be honest. It sounds dumb but it was back in 7th grade, so you know a typical 7th grade mind would be like “OMG I CAN HACK SCRUBS FOR DAYS” . To be honest Hackforums turned into a social forum for me. I admire people’s Keyloggers, RATs and all that jazz but I enjoy talking to people on here. What got me to Hackforums is completely different to what makes me stay. What makes me stay is the active community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] How do you feel about the community as a whole? Do you think it was better back when you registered or do you think it's better now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly I like it better now. The community as a whole got more active. I feel like before I was completely in the dark of what was happening. Everything just sort of happened between certain people. Now the community is willing to accept new members on their own. However one thing that got worse was the scamming. The scamming got increasingly difficult to avoid since members that are deemed trusted usually scam too. I recommend never going first in a transaction with no exceptions. I was victim to this and now I am more careful in the marketplace.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry to hear you got scammed. Care to share what you have planned for the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] I plan to inform fellow members of Hackforums that you should never go first if you are doing a currency exchange. I know this isn’t full-proof, but it is a start. I made the mistake of going first twice. Since then I learned that going first is your biggest mistake. Every time I get a PM now that states that I should go first, I automatically deny. 9/10 you will see a scam report against them within a hour.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Now, what if both sides don't want to go first? How will that work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] I would suggest using a trusted Middleman service. They are many around Hackforums. Find one that you trust the most and deal with them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. You tend to deal in the marketplace often. What other sections do you like to be in and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] I like to visit the Lounge, HF News, and The Suggestions and Feedback sections quite often. I like how the lounge is very laid back and very versatile in discussions. Most of them are trolls, but sometimes troll is good. HF News is very informative and helps me stay on point with what is going around here on Hackforums. Suggestions are always good to look at. What is fun is seeing the responses that say “Already suggested”, or the replies Omniscient or any other staff member makes. The feedback is also nice because I see many HQ members giving their feedback. However most of the feedback’s are quite similar. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] If you were able to change one thing about HF, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] If I was going to change something about HF, I would definitely change the Marketplace. I would make it more friendly towards new marketers who want to sell their products. Many of the new products are buried under the more vouched and rated threads. That is something I would change definitely.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I agree, that would be a really nice change. Thanks for taking the time to be with us, Salty Bacon. Anything else you want to say before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1342175][color=white][b]Salty Bacon:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to thank you guys for interviewing me. I have opened many new doors here on Hackforums and I am looking forward to all the good days to come.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

The hackers have stolen data that includes manifests which contain information on passengers within the airlines and their origins and destinations. Since United Airlines is the second largest airline and also plays as a large U.S military contractor the hackers have information that can be used to track military or government officials. This hack now raises an issue for commercial airlines that cyber security should be taken more seriously. American Airlines has opened up a bug bounty program for anyone that can find vulnerabilities within it's systems. American Airlines is paying in free air miles for finding a security flaw instead of hard and cold cash. If you want to take a vacation around the world for free you should take this offer while it's on the table.

The bug, which resides in Android's 'Stagefright Multimedia Playback Engine,' leaves over 90 percent of the world's Android devices critically vulnerable to this attack. It is aptly being referred to as \"Heartbleed for Android.\" The bug allows an attacker to simply send a malicious media file, [b]without the need for it to be opened by the victim,[/b] to someone's phone number to execute code remotely. This would allow an attacker to craft a program that deletes the text without the user even knowing that he'd received one. The vulnerability, discovered by Joshua J. Drake (vice-president of Platform Research and Exploitation at Zimperium zLabs) leverages a variety of implementation issues in Stagefright. Drake will be presenting his findings and the code he uses at the infamous BlackHat Security Conference in Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Windows 10 And the Death of Privacy[/color][/b]\r\nWith the release of the highly anticipated Windows 10, Microsoft also released a new [url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx]Privacy Policy[/url] that has been deemed incredibly intrusive. It allows Microsoft to take much greater amounts of data from your browser and application usage. It allows friends on Facebook and other social media sites to use your Wi-Fi passwords to connect to their networks (excluding, of course, 802.1x pre-authentication). And it allows the unfettered distribution of your data to other organizations, advertisers, and government agencies. The only way to achieve adequate privacy protection from Microsoft requires the disabling of dozens of settings such as advertisement ID's, Wi-Fi Sense, and Data Usage Reporting. Also, custom registry and global policy changes are required to prevent them from taking application usage data and other data collections. The outcry against Microsoft for their heavily intrusive new Privacy Policy will hopefully allow a future update to be more customizable and have more privacy.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Identities revealed on TOR without cracking encryption [/color][/b]\r\nA security research team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([i]MIT[/i]) has found a vulnerability that can expose a TOR hidden server with great accuracy. TOR is used by those who yearn for privacy and TOR uses a series of nodes and relays to ensure the privacy of every user on the Onion network. The security team has explained that they can disguise themselves as one of TORs entry nodes through a vulnerability which gives them access to see packets coming from the user. They can see exactly what hidden services the user has been using just by analyzing the traffic data and packet patterns. The team has described this process as \"Circuit Fingerprinting\". This problem has been reported to TOR representatives who may later fix it with a future update. You should take more precaution while browsing TOR because the Onion network has been faced with many successful breaches lately.

Coming a month after Google announced their \"My Account Features\" Facebook has followed suite with their own tool that allows users to monitor logins, logout of accounts and change security settings. It also includes tips for staying safe online along with creating a secure password. Currently the app is web based only with a mobile version soon to be released. For more information on how to use this feature please see the source.

It has grown over the years to be one of the most popular ways to \"anonymize\" oneself over the internet and access the darkweb. With it all ready seeing it become the targets of many different groups attacks, it should come as no surprise that yet again another layer has been peeled off the onion. Security researchers from MIT have come up with an attack that allows someone to monitor with 88% accuracy what site you are on if they are already monitoring your connection to TOR. While no actual information can be seen, what they can see if the hidden services are running. In an e-mail, Tor project leader Roger Dingledine has said that because of real world requirements they do not see it as much of a threat, but are working on ways around it.

Rewritten from scratch and optimized for modern computing it will server as the launching platform for many years to come. It brings many wonder new features( such and multi desktops) and phases out many hated features( like IE) truly showing  just how far we have come from those early windows days. However many choices have left security researches and system administrators worried, microsoft it seems is putting the \"user\" first and in a way security on the back burner. On launch there was expected to be 0 days which where quickly patched, but other choices have left us baffled. For instance why Microsoft's Web Sence which can share your Wi-Fi password with all your contacts. How the fact that Cortana is a spying machine listening at all times, you have a unique ID for marketing, or that your backup key for bitlocker is backed up to OneDrive. All of these features are turned on by default but can be turned off. So the question is should you update? In my opinion, yes if you are running 7 or 8, I already have but keep this in mind. Microsoft owns your data and do with it what it likes.

However, the free game has always been decided solely by Playstation and not by the players. This changes with the introduction of a voting system for the free game of the month, letting players choose to vote for one of three games to be made available for free to Playstation Plus members for a month, with the two losing games being discounted but not completely free.

As a part of the League of Legends lore, the pirate character Gangplank has been killed and rendered unplayable in the gaming client. This death comes as a part of the Bilgewater event, which was a promotional feature that had Gangplank being killed by his nemesis, Miss Fortune. Here is the official word from Riot regarding Gangplank’s recent removal from playability: “Champion death is unprecedented in League of Legends, and we do not take it lightly. We encourage all Gangplank fans to remain calm for a few days until we can fully assess the situation. At this time, we are not addressing refund requests for him or his skins but please know that over the next several days we’ll do our best to make things right for everyone.” While the character may currently be dead, there is information in the Bilgewater event that may point towards Gangplank’s eventual revival.

This is what Bungie had to say about the bans: \"We know you want justice. We've seen the chatter. We've read the reports. Yesterday and today, our Security Response Team has restricted access to the Crucible by the worst offenders among us all,\" Bungie wrote. \"We started with a look at the most notorious cheaters that had been reported by other players. After a cross-reference against our own player-data, we gave the Banhammer a mighty swing. Contained in its blast radius were hundreds of people who have manipulated network traffic.\" Also mentioned in the weekly update is the importance of reporting players with Bungie’s in-game reporting tools whenever cheating is suspected. Bungie asks their players to be fair and honorable while enjoying the game.

Now it’s Windows 10, and Thursday, July 29th it hit the airwaves for what appeared to be as many people as Microsoft can keep the servers running for. For a while, it was expected that only Insiders would get it first, followed by those who request the update, as well as anyone who buys a new machine starting Thursday. It appeared that lots of people got it right away though, which is a nice surprise.\r\n\r\nTo install it on your current machine, first check Windows Update; you should see a notification saying that it’s available, assuming you pre-registered for the update. If it’s there, then that’s the simplest way, and you can install it right over your current install and preserve all of your existing software and data. While this is good news, the better news is that if you want to do a clean install of Windows 10 — say, if you’re a stickler for a super-clean machine like some of us are — you can do it with a new Windows 10 .ISO file, which you can download straight from Microsoft’s website and install on a USB key.

The carrier isn’t too pleased about it. Yesterday, on July 30th, AT&T petitioned the FCC to reconsider by withdrawing its order, ceasing to enforce certain “non-monetary penalties” and ensuring that any revised fine falls below a $16,000 maximum. Its long list of demands are justified by the FCC’s “wholly implausible” fine that was “plucked out of thin air,” AT&T said. The Federal Trade Commission and FCC together allege that AT&T violated the FTC Act by failing to advertise, or even adhere to, its “network optimization” policies. It failed to articulate its throttling rules in marketing materials and to customers, and millions of subscribers with grandfathered “unlimited” data plans had their transfers reduced — sometimes to dial-up speeds — over a period of years.

According to a statement sent out today, July 31, the batteries inside the mobile Android gaming devices can overheat and cause fires. Nvidia has asked that customers stop using affected Shield tablets immediately, “except as needed to participate in the recall and back up data.” The recall affects 8-inch Shield tablets sold between July 2014 and July 2015. To see if the recall affects your Shield tablet, visit Nvidia’s website. There, you’ll find instructions to tell which type of battery your device has and you can also submit a claim through that website.

Palmer who is a dentist from Minnesota, was believed to have paid close to £35,000 to lure then shoot and kill Cecil, the famous Zimbabwe lion. The animal was shot on July 1 in Hwange National Park. Currently internet do-gooders are ripping him and his business to shreds on [url=http://www.yelp.com/biz/river-bluff-dental-bloomington?osq=walter%20palmer%20dentist]Yelp[/url] and there has been an outcry across the world. So far Palmer does not face any charges for what he did as he claims he expected the guides to take the necessary precautions, all of which are currently being fined and may serve jail time. Palmer has reached out the authorities for help over the many death threats he is receiving and has only apologised to his patients for the disruption which has been caused. \r\n[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cecil-lions-killer-walter-palmer-contacts-authorities-n402081]>>Source 1[/url][/size][/i]\r\n[i][size=x-small][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4925911]>>Source 2[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]United States Children Sex Trade[/b][/color]\r\nDue to the poverty within the US, exploitation is bound to happen and one such dark underworld is the children sex slave business. It offer very little ways out but many ways in. Not many know of the business but tens of thousands of American children are thought to be sexually exploited every year. FBI have claimed that child sex abuse is almost at an 'epidemic' level, despite the agency rescuing 600 children last year. From an aunt who bought her niece and to a kidnapping which left a teenager missing for two years, there are many ways to get into the trade but often the children are abused, fed drugs and exploited to make themselves believe this was their choice. The trade almost becomes an addiction and a lifestyle for many of the girls. Thankfully Breaking Free, a charity aimed to help child sex slaves recuperate and get out are at hand and are offering support to the girls and boys caught in the trade.

A cyclone struck the state of West Bengal, causing a heavy monsoon which has flooded and forced tens of thousands of victims out of their homes and for the unlucky, killed them. Over 200,000 people have moved to refugee camps during the monsoon season in order to protect themselves. Nearly four million people in 10,000 villages have been affected by the floods in the worst-affected Indian state of West Bengal, the home ministry said. India receives most of its rain during the monsoon season which is between June and September and the incessant rain over several weeks leads to flooding and worse. Over 200 medical teams which used over 120 boats reached the flood-hit areas in an attempt to rescue those stuck.
