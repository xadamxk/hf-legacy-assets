Great new feature, however it's possible that because of the potential abuse that new feature puts foreword, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has now made it so that you can still not see the users profile but you can now see a reputation link. This will make it easier for the potential person who was scammed so they can now still leave a negative reputation on the scammer. Also keep in mind that this is only an upgraded member feature. The user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651][color=#EFEFEF][b]Coppersan[/b][/color][/url] and I tested out the new feature and also took a screenshot so you can see what the Ignore Error message will look like.

Today we're here with Pali, what's going on man? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] Glad to be here. I just got off work, and now I'm eating Hot Cheetos and cuddling my dog. Trying to keep things 100% trill.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] You seem like a real thug, Cheetos and dogs? Anyway, are there any members you'd like to give a shoutout to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] Sure. I've been \"off\" HF for a year, so I think I appreciate them more than they do me, but that doesn't matter. Vinnie, Stay Plural, Yellows, BagHead, Nate (Remorsal), D3xus, Hexicidal, bugga, Esdese, iNviZ, Leminiscent, and all the super HQ members of Nightfall.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Those are some great members, I must say. So what do you mean you were \"off\" for a year? What happened?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] My account was closed for about a year. There were a lot of factors behind my account being closed, but I'd rather not talk about it. I'm very glad Omni reopened my account.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, that's one long vacation. So does the site seem different now compared to what you were used to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] A lot, a lot, a lot more attention whores. HF has always had them, those kiddies who whore for stats like awards, posts, rep, yata yata. But I feel like from late 2012 and onward, it's only gotten much worse. Everyone here is more of a profile than a person. Even on cam, or mics, everyone thinks their stats define them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed, it's hard to find genuine people nowadays. But some change is good right? Aside from the tryhards, what about all the new features and development?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, very much so. I came back as L33t rather than Ub3r so I don't get to enjoy a lot of the new features, sadly. I will say, Omni is doing grand with these new features. Ep1c is wonderful, I look forward to seeing what else will be made for it. HF IM XMPP is amazing, I just hope group chat opens up for it. 6 months between applying for Ub3r is a very positive change. Vacation Bans without PMing Omni is neat, I'm sure it saves him time. I love the changes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] They are pretty nifty, not gonna lie. One thing that might not have needed change, however, is the groups. Being an older member, do you prefer the older groups over the current ones?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] Older I suppose. The more time that passes the more useless I think groups become. I've been in a ton of groups because I'm a dirty little group whore, and I can say the majority are pointless.  They're becoming just popularity contests, userbars for friends, being used as monopoly, or being a complete waste of time/money. I think a majority of all groups are pretty damn stupid. Most are just userbars, basically. Every group wants to be original and unique, every group cares more about their image than what they actually do. Just like a majority of the users here, profiles and userbars. Not people and group. Nightfall is fucking sweet though. Gaming niche is 100%, freedom is 100%, chill-vibe is 100%. I wish things were taken a bit seriously but I understand that's hard with how it's ran.. I wish groups were more like a brotherhood, but that's near impossible considering no ones gonna drop 10k on HF with sincere attentions to build trust, relations and to last forever.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I feel you man. If given the chance, how would you handle a group to make it worthwhile?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] Exactly how I ran Infamous, before it was taken over and turned into shit.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That group was a crowd favorite during its prime back in the day, it would be cool to see with current groups. So how did you come across HF in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] I came here to sell OG Gamertags. Oh how I miss the old OG Gamertag scene.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Quite a few members came to sell gamertags if I remember correctly. Are you not into it as much as you used to be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] The market doesn't make sense to me anymore. OG Instagrams and Snapchats make the hipster in me happy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I don't even know what that's supposed to mean, but OK. What do you do outside of HF? Any cool hobbies you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] No I'm a very boring person. I work 65-85 hours a week, I like writing, I like gaming, I like to cook, I like to eat.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] The life of the party eh? Why'd you choose Pali as a username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] It's something I used as an alias being Palestinian and it stuck since an early age. To me it's just my name, nothing to do with being Palestinain but that's how it originated despite me not caring about culture in the slightest.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's pretty cool. Is there anything else you'd like to say before we conclude?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali:[/b][/color][/url] bitches ain't shit but tricks and hoes\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382]Balloon[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 218th edition of the HF News, it's an honor to be her today with Balloon. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] I'd like to shoutout ItsFluffy and Lajcik. Two of my best friends on the forum. Without either of them I probably wouldn't be where I'm at today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I recoginize one of the names. How did you get to know these two individuals?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] ItsFluffy is actually the reason I joined the forum. You might remember he offered a free stresser that you could access with PuTTy. I then started offering a service in the Free Services and Giveaways section where I would download the Fileice file for them and they would get access. I met Lajcik after purchasing his software. I really liked the way he interacted with me and I have been working with him ever since.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So I must ask since you've been in the Red Lions for a long time, how is the group? It seems to have taken a dip in forum presence, what's going on with that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Well I can't really go over what goes on in the Group sub-forum and I won't be speaking on Glassy's behalf on activity. All I can say is just because group activity isn't targeted towards the entire forum, doesn't necessarily mean it isn't active. Things are in the making right now though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's good to hear. I know a member in the Red Lions and the loyalty of the members is off the charts, congrats to you guys. So tell me what do you do outside of the forum? Got any fun hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Red Lions is definitely a group of genuine people. I wouldn't have the group any other way...Outside of the forum I work, go to school, work on clients projects for SEO, and train my dog/work her.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What kind of dog do you? What are you training her for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Well the dog is actually my brother's but I like to think of her as my own. Her name is Penelope and she is a pure bred chocolate lab. Right now I am working with her in preperation for a new bird dog I just put a down payment on. The dog will be a german shorthaired pointer used for hunting birds and finding deer sheds.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome! I wish I had the patience to do that, but I need to get a dog first, sadly mine passed away when I was in high school. So what are you going to school for?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Well I went to school for two years studying Civil Engineering. At the end of the second year I changed majors before I left and switched to Information Technology. Then I ended up being diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis and was bed ridden for like 6 months until I was able to be treated. It's a long story but I'm better now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're doing better now. So I see you run a successful SEO service, how do you get into that line of work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] I appreciate that...Well this all started when I was in High School. A friend and I had a website that we were working on and wanted to get it ranked. Him and I had been trying to figure out how to increase it's position on Google. After we ranked that we started seeing new things that Google was doing with their algorithms that directly affected our site. I had been interested ever since. I have tons of notepads and old engineering paper that is filled with everything I have ever tried. Tons of trial and error. You can never stop learning and I can safely say that I will have more to learn in years to come. Oh and fuck you Matt Cutts.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Seems tricky, but good for you that you can figure that stuff out. So ItsFluffy got you on the forum, what made you want to join? I remember back to when I first heard about the site, I was nervous at first to join because everyone was an anonymous hacker.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Well I had the same exact thoughts. I forgot to mention that I also play video games but ever since Xbox one came out I stopped. I play both Halo and Call of Duty and kept getting hit offline. I got sick of it and decided to try and find an alternative without having to spend money. I saw his thread and downloaded the file. I was amazed that I could just type in the IP and the player would leave the game. Ever since then I have been friends with Fluffy. I also believe that I ended up getting invited into Red Lions for downloading those files. Fluffy got me nominated for wining my ub3r upgrade. I owe a lot of my HF life to him.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] He's a good guy. Dare I call use old fags, all the 2009 kids would get mad, but we've been on the forum since 2011, what keeps you active?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] I'm not nearly as active as I used to be. You may also notice since 2011 I have only posted around 2500+ times. Many people change who they are on forums but I normally just read what others have to post and if I have anything to say I will say it. Right now I treat HF as a personal marketplace and sell services through it and look for new partnerships that I could potentially make. I try to stay away from certain sections as well. Most of them are just pure cancer and lead to nothing but drama.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'd agree with that. I treat Hack Forums as business now, I post sometimes when I have something to sell. So if you could change one thing on site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Well there aren't many things I would change in terms of how my HF life has played out. There are a lot of people who like to swing their e-penises around and there isn't much for regular members and l33ts to do about it. I really hope some day Omni gets around to creating some sort of vouch based system that will provide something meaningful in the marketplace. Rep is easily earned and really shouldn't be used as an indicator of someones success and trust.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'd agree. Ever since I joined there was the vouch system rumor and I wish something was done with it. How do you feel about Hack Forums have a crypto currency? Do you like OmniCoin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] I have heard these rumors as well. It looks like Omni is starting to put his plans in motion though so only time will tell...I actually completely switched to Bitcoins for payments in the marketplace here. There are too many reasons for why I won't accept a reversible payment processor on a Hacking Forum. I definiltey like the idea of OmniCoins. I actually have even looked up the keyword competition and thought about trying to rank the site for a few of them. I decided against it because of the amount of things I have going on with my own clients. OmniCoins definitely have a lot of potential though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I just don't like the scarcity of OMC, it's near impossible get a hold of them from members on site. Well I think that's about all the time we have for this interview. Are there any final remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=771382][color=#EFEFEF]Balloon:[/color][/url] Most likely because of Omni's plans for a new group for OmniCoin. People are definiltey holding onto them...I just would like to thank Omni for keeping HF alive as well as staff/mentors for doing their part to cleanup HF. Thanks to Glassy and Nokia for keeping me apart of the RL. Thanks 630 for interviewing me and best of luck with the rest of your journey on HF. Bye for now.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

There is still a demand for them on the popular [url=https://www.allcrypt.com/market?id=672]AllCrypt exchange[/url]. Omnicoins started out the week with a price of 389 satoshis and hit a high of 642 satoshis midweek, an increase of 65%. They ended the week with a price of 420 satoshis, still %7 higher than at the beginning of the week.\n\n[color=white][b]Omnicoin miners ramp up the speed[/b][/color]\nSince the block reward halving back in early November Omnicoin has seen an [url=https://omnicha.in/charts]increased hashrate and difficulty[/url] due to miners trying to maximize their profits. This week the difficulty topped out at a whopping 24, the highest it has been for over 2 weeks. Sadly a good deal of the reason for the increase is due to burst mining, a harmful method of mining that reduces profits for dedicated miners and results in long confirmation times.

The repercussions of this may include the jeopardization of credit card data from transactions the company has handled between November of 2009 and September of 2014. And investigation of the network and malware revealed that an unauthorized user had gained access to the network and installed a rather sophisticated malicious that was then used to create the capture and transmit encrypted data from the network. Only certain information from recent network captures has been identified as stolen, and it is all from August 2014-September of 2014, but the attacker has certainly had access to the network for far longer than that. The reason the attacker was so successful is that the internal network did not use encrypted traffic and the attacker was therefore able to capture much of it in plaintext.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Lance Ealy: ID Thief + Wanted Fugitive[/color][/b]\r\nLance Ealy, an Ohio man arrested in 2013 year for buying Social Security numbers and banking information from an underground identity theft service, has allegedly left his town after his convictions. The 28 year old man was found guilty of committing 46 charges, including identity theft, mail fraud, wire fraud, among others. Earlier was also convicted of using the stolen data to fraudulently claim tax refunds with the IRS in the names of an estimated 179 U.S. citizens, including while he was on trial! When we look at the charges Ealy faced, it's fairly easy to understand why he felt he had no choice but to leave. Each of the 46 charges carries with it a fine of up to $250,000 which amounts to $11.5 million! Not only this, but 15 of the counts can carry a 10 year life sentence each. Identity theft and tax fraud are crimes that, thoug they can have  high payout, also have an incredibly high punishment and drove Ealy to living on the lam for the foreseeable future.\r\n\n[b][color=white]White Hat Hacker Returns 225 'Stolen' BTC[/color][/b]\r\nA set of known and disclosed vulnerabilities within BlockChain, as well as within BTC address activity itself, allowed a white hat hacker under the psedonym \"Johoe\" to intercept the payments of over 1,000 BTC addresses. However, he or she did this only to prevent others from getting them with malicious intention. On the [url=https://bitcointalk.org/]BitcoinTalk forum[/url], he announced that there were hundreds of broken addresses whose funds could be swiped, and that he would gladly return all of the money to anyone who could prove that it came from their BTC address. True to his word, the Blockchain CEO, Nicolas Carey, has since given confirmation that the funds had been received. The vulnerability arose from the fact that the blockchain wallets were being produced with certain pseudo-random numbers that may be predictable and sometimes allows attackers to deduce the private encryption key by the public address. The vulnerability, as we know it, has since been fixed and victims are being reimbursed after proof of loss. Great job to all of the well-meaning hackers out there!\r\n\n[color=white][b]The Pirate Bay – Taken Down After Server Room Raid[/b][/color]\r\nThe infamous and widely used online torrenting site that goes by the name \"The Pirate Bay\" has now been shut down and seized after Swedish police raided their server room. The Pirate Bay is a widely used site which allows the public to illegally download copyrighted material such as movies, games, music, software, and more – and at no charge. So you can see why law enforcement would want to take it down. Although, this is most definitely not the first time the site has been taken offline and seized; it has been shut down numerous times by the FBI and Swedish police. It will be interesting to see if the notorious site will be reborn once again. \r\n\n[color=white][b]Sony Leaks Take a Dark Turn[/b][/color]\r\nContinuing with the Sony phenomenon, it has now been reported that the recent breach in Sony’s systems have now taken an even darker and more sinister turn. The group that goes by the name Guardians of Peace (GoP) who have claimed to be responsible for the Sony hacking have now stated that they have released an abundance of private and confidential information such as: Sony employee names, upcoming film budgets, celebrity contact numbers, upcoming film scripts, and more. This is just one more thing to add to the already 40GB worth of confidential data the hacker group has released to the public. Whether or not this information is useful to the public is irrelevant, this just goes to show that even the top companies are vulnerable. We wish you luck in recovery Sony.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/FzWb5Ce.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n[b][color=white]New WWE Game in the Making[/color][/b]\r\nMortal Kombat developers have been working on something...Different. Not that much info has been released about the upcoming fighter game, but those wanting to purchase the game don't have to worry; it's free! If you're looking for a new mobile game to play for free, this might be worth checking out. With the release date sometime in 2015, that's a lot of time for the developers to share more information on what's to come and what the game offers. At the current time, there isn't a lot of things the public knows. Sadly. In a new WWE-based world, the game is supposedly something that's never been seen before with fun and epic battles to partake in. In addition, NetherRealm studios, is also working on a new Mortal Kombat game as well for consoles, which can also be obtained next year.\r\n\n[b][color=white]CoD: AW DLC Weapons Trailer[/color][/b]\r\nOwners of the DLC pass for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare will be given the option to download two new weapons in the newest DLC, Havoc, earlier than those without the pass. Being released sometime next year in 2015, gamers with the pass will receive the \"AE4 Directed Energy Assault Rifle\" as well as a customized version of the gun named the \"AE4 Widowmaker\". Both of the weapons can be seen in the trailer which can be seen [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b25hy5XALw]here[/url]. The assault rifle was made for the aggressive player who likes to both rush, as-well as play tactical; fight behind cover, move behind enemy lines, and surprise the enemy. Giving your character the speed of running with a sub-machine gun (gun is lighter than most AR's in AW) this benefits your gameplay by making the character you are playing run longer distances and possibly faster. Handling the gun in-game will be easier for those using it too. No other information has been leaked or announced regarding the DLC besides the weapons, but it may give us some insight of what is to come with the new Exo-Zombies gamemode being introduced.\r\n\n[b][color=white]SWAT Has Arrived[/color][/b]\r\nThe playlist most Halo fans enjoy has made a return in the newest bundle, Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Lucky for those interested, no update is needed to play the gamemode. Immediately after launching the game, you should see the playlist available. SWAT is not, repeat not, available on all the games provided within Halo: The Master Chief Collection, though, 343 has said. Limited to only Halo 2: Anniversary, the classic Halo 2, and Halo 4, developers back at 343 also state that Halo 3 may be receiving the playlist as well, but there hasn't been a confirmation on that. A few last things have been changed with the release of the gamemode: The maximum people in a Big Team Battle party is 4-6 players, but the developers from 343 is working on allowing 8 players on each team. In addition, Some of the playlists have been updated too by making it 4v4 for the following modes:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Team Slayer\r\n[*]Halo 2 Classic\r\n[*]Halo 3\r\n[*]Halo Championship Series\r\n[*]SWAT[/list]\r\n\nIn the future, more playlists within the modes will be updated to 4v4 as well, so that should be expected soon.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Video Game Release Dates for the Week of December 12th, 2014:[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN -  PS3, PS4 - December 16th, 2014\r\n[*]Loadout - PS3, PS4 - December 16th, 2014\r\n[*]Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots - PS3, PS4 - December 16th, 2014\r\n[*]Tetris Ultimate - PS3, PS4 - December 16th, 2014\r\n[*]Resogun  - PS3, PS4 - December 17th, 2014\r\n[*]Kalimba - Xbox One, Xbox 360 - December 17th, 2014\r\n[/align]\r\n[/list]\r\n\n[align=left][b][color=white]DLC Release Dates for the Week of December 12th, 2014:[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel ‘The Holodome Onslaught’ DLC - December 16th, 2014\r\n[*]X Rebirth: The Teladi Post DLC - Steam - [b]Free all through December[/b]\r\n[*]DriveClub ‘Redline Expansion Pack’ DLC - December 17th, 2014\r\n[/align]\r\n[/list]\r\n\n[sp=Gaming Video of the Week]\r\n[yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijIQHy-8pEM[/yt]\r\n[/sp]\r\n[/align][/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/4bc5BgF.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\n[b][color=white]United States Navy Shows Off Weapon Of The Future; A Laser Weapon System[/color][/b]\r\nThe United States Navy has created and tested a weapon known of only in science fiction, until now. The weapon is called LaWS, or simply Laser Weapon System and was tested as a prototype upon the USS Ponce. The prototype went without fail in many different conditions and was extremely accurate making it a perfect weapon for attacking drones, small ships and planes. The prototype worked without a hitch, and will be used on the USS Ponce regularly as it is considered a fully functional prototype. The United States plans to have the LaWS on all of it's fleet by 2020.\r\n\n[img=300x300]http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_navy_laws_weapon_tk_130804_wmain.jpg[/img]\r\nImage Source: [url=abcnews.com]abcnews.com[/url]\r\n\nVideo Demonstration: \r\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0DbgNju2wE[/video]\r\n\nIf you watch the video demonstration you will notice this weapon is controlled by a controller that looks similar to an Xbox controller. The simplicity os use for this weapon means less men will be needed to operate this weapon compared to other weapons.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Cheap DIY Build-able Computer Targets Children For Computer And Programming Education[/color][/b]\r\nA new tech toy that is being marketed towards children called the Kano computer kit is being sold for $150.

After building the computer, you actually have to program it so it gives children a great learning experience backed up by some easy to follow illustrated tutorials. Once you have set up the computer, 6 coding levels are on the computer such as how to program simple games like pong, but of course many more are available.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Apple 1 Sold At Auction[/color][/b]\r\nWith less than 50 Apple 1 computers left in existence, seeing this piece of history is pretty exciting. The Apple 1 is one of the only machines ever to be personally sold by Steve Jobs from his garage in 1976 in California when Apple was just a start up company. The Apple 1 Computer sold at the auction was sold $365000.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810[/color][/b]\r\nIn the past few years, phone and tablet processors have not changed much.

Qualcomm's goal is to start rolling out 4K tablets with the capability of fully replacing your laptop.

The leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin is trying to control internet access in Russia to an extreme. The country has already made their own version of Facebook, and have copied multiple other social media websites just for Russia. No word on if Google will be available for Russia after this, but Google is clearly afraid of Russia stealing data and raiding their offices.\r\n\n[b][color=white]iRobot's Create 2 Bot[/color][/b]\r\nUsually technology made for educational purposed and tinkering is expensive, but iRobot has decided to change that. iRobot's Create 2 bot is available for purchase for the affordable price of $200.
