Today we get to interview an older member of HF, Stl Missouri. Do you have any shoutouts, notes, or things you would like to mention here before we get started?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url]Nope.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] Short and sweet; I like it. I do believe when I was interviewed some time ago I only made two to three of them, so I can definitely relate. So what are your hobbies like outside of HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] I spend most of my time programming and working on school stuff and I also partake in illegal activities with friends.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] Well I can definitely see how some of that ties into what you're seemingly interested in on HF, though I can't quite associate the second part. Oh well, that's just me. What'd you register on HF for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] I actually joined because of minecraft griefing, but I didn't take it seriously at all. My original HF name was BigJew.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] Wow, at least you turned things around. It seems you spend a lot of your time on HF in that section. What are your opinions on it? Do you think it could be improved?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] It could be better, but it definitely can't be improved. The entire section is a bunch of low quality retards, but I love them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] If your friend can't call you something like that, who can? I've come to love things similarly on HF, but not quite to that degree. Anywho, I noticed you have a modded client that you sold. How's your progress on that and when did you start coding things like it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] I started working on clients in june last year (2012) and sold my first client \"Avid\" starting June 20, 2012. I made a fair amount of money from it and then decided to start working on Cobalt with a few friends. It's definitely one of the more popular premium clients.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] I'm glad you're doing well with it. I've used it myself in the past and I can definitely say that it's very obvious that you spent a lot of time on it. Hard work pays off, eh? Let's move on from small talk though and get to some more serious things. Do you have any goals on HF or in real life? Do you think that they're doable?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] I don't really have any goals on HF, I try to minimize my time spent on there. As far as real life goals I'm working on a project with a few of my developer friends which will hopefully prove useful to people and possibly go far. I've been doing some tech help at my school for a while, just small jobs around the school but it's really cool to see how actual jobs in the IT field work, since I've been working with the main tech administrator.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] Both things definitely sound like something that requires a lot of time, work, and effort. Have you made any progress with it? If so, do you think you're going to go further in that field?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] I don't really know. I'm a junior in high school so I'm supposed to have my future planned out, but  I have almost no idea what I'm going to do. I'll probably going to go into some sort of tech field, since that's what I'm interested in. For the school I've just been doing small jobs, since they can't give me any sort of heightened privileges on the system.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] I wouldn't take any offense to it as that's regulation for most places. Being a minor and all, ya'know. Do you apply the languages you use to develop things online to such activities? Surely knowledge of such can only help.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] Unfortunately the most I can do for the school is use their website software and it's page builder to design pages, which is really restrictive. I've been working on setting up a small site to allow students to create tickets and request help, but I have to set up and host that myself, since the district has tons of tight protocols they have to follow.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=#7BFF00][b]Lovol: [/b][/color][/url] Hey man, anything that can help is good. I'm glad that I've gotten to know more about you and I truly wish that you further pursue what you like doing. A lot of people don't realize that's key for success anymore. Unfortunately, though, we're running out of time. Do you have any closing notes or anything else to add?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1076932][color=white][b]Stl Missouri: [/b][/color][/url] Nothing at the current moment, but I appreciate the opportunity to be interviewed. Thanks Lovol.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340]AlbinoShadow[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Welcome to whateverthefuckthiseditionis of the Hack Forums News! Today we get to interview a hidden talent here at HF, AlbinoShadow! Do you have any shoutouts you'd like to make before we get started?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]Nawh, shoutouts are silly. Only thing I have to say is thank you for interviewing me and thank you Paradoxum for allowing me to represent The Alliance.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]It's a pleasure to be interviewing you. :) Now before I get too into things, I'm curious.. AlbinoShadow, how did you come up with a name like that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]When I was about 10 I was using the gamertag \"Blademaster II\" on Xbox, but many of my friends had told me that I needed to change it eventually and shortly enough we all changed our names to \"Albino (insert animal name here)818\", but when I hadn't used an animal and didn't use a space they promptly unfriended me :( We were kids.\n\nNonetheless, I loved the oxymoron behind it and took the 818 off around 2009 and became AlbinoShadow.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Your friends at the time were dicks, yo. No worries, no matter what I'll always wuv you even if you fuck up a group thing like that. :3 Anyways, onto the real stuff. You just started college and at the age of 16. What's it like being in college at such a young age?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]What if I fuck up our fox clan? It's nothing special, I dropped out of high school to pursue a faster education because I wanted to pinpoint my interests and work towards them instead of following the standard high school curriculum meant for students still looking for an occupation of their own. The only real difference is that I'm playing catch up for a lot of classes since I skipped two maybe even three years of math and english... Besides all of that, it's nothing special!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]It's still pretty fascinating, at least in my opinion. Now, you're studying game design and creation if I remember correctly, what made you chose that field?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]I've always been interested in creating my own world. The idea of being able to create a world of my own and have others immerse themselves in the environment sounded great to me. After making my own maps in Warcraft and Starcraft I worked towards professional game development and am now majoring in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. I mean, creating worlds and stuff is only second nature since I'm god and all ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Back the fuck up there bitch, we all know I am Xypher, thus I am god.  That's wonderful. I'm sure others would agree with me, but I fucking hate this reality and have always thought that creating another world to be such a wonderful idea. What genre's of games do you plan on focusing on most of all?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]That's what sort of drives me. I [b]want[/b] the ability to create my own perfect reality. As of right now, I am going to focus on online strategy games similar to League of Legends and Starcraft. In the future I am hoping to work in the competitive eSports scene and after that perhaps on a fantasy RPG.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Well, if ya ever need someone good with character concepts and lore.. *wink wink* Seriously though, that really is fascinating. I can't wait to see what you create, sign me up as one of your beta testers for anything and everythings you make. :) Now, other than your goals in the gaming realm, what other goals in life, both online and off, do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]Hey man, who knows maybe I'll need a demigod position in a game and you can fill in. Offline I'm looking to better my relationship with my girlfriend since she too might be dropping out of high school and moving in with me next year which I look forward to. Also, I am working towards bettering myself with game development of course, by summer next year I want to try to have a game prepped and primed for GDC (Game Development Conference) and IGF (Independent Games Festival). Online though? Get Gold V on LoL before Season 4 comes around. On HackForums specifically I'm working towards getting more involved with group leadership and membership; I find private subforums higher quality than the public ones.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's inspiring to hear about your girlfriend, I wish you both the best of luck with things. I'm sure you'll be able to accomplish both having a game prepared as well as Gold V before Season 4.  As for groups; well.. you're one of the most dedicated members of The Alliance, so I have no doubt your goals with private groups will come to fruition. So you have a girlfriend, you're an aspiring game creator, you're a very good gamer.. What else do you do in your free time?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]Well, I hope to also work on games with her since she will be going into arts for game development  I don't have much free time since I am on a 154 credit 4 year plan... When I do have the time, I party with my new friends and play League of Legends. Majority of time off of class I am working on my game project, but we all need breaks eventually (and of course we all have to party once in awhile).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]It seems like you're enjoying the college life. Don't go too crazy there. :3 So, do you have any specific projects planned for HF that you can talk about?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]Well of course you're sure I have something planned :3 I'm sure your Kitsune no Ie Wa could just possibly have room for my contributions in the subforum. I have made a few threads that I would like to post to get the Sticky award, but I have not finalized them due to a severe case of lazy. Overall though, my main plans lie within groups, I'd like to begin being an actual representative of The Alliance.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]I'm glad to know I have your support for that project. <3  So these threads you are working on, can you give us any insight on what they'll be covering? I'm sure at least one of them is about game development, but how about the others?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]I had one for Starcraft back when I played semi-professionally. I also, am thinking about creating one for League of Legends. As for game development, for the most part I am keeping that towards private subforums as I don't believe HackForums is the place for that complexity of code. Not to be insulting, but I will be posting any code to GameDeception if I would like to share it or have it reviewed... Private groups will of course have access to my playtests, my code contributions, and even lessons \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Well I can't wait to see all you have planned for HF. I'm sure what you have to share is truly great.  Sadly (truly), our time is up. It was so wonderful to be able to interview you and hear more about your plans. Before we go, do you have any advice to those reading this?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=371340][color=white][b]AlbinoShadow: [/b][/color][/url]Stay in school... Until you're 16 atleast  Honestly my advice to HackForums is learn time management and work towards your goals. Learn to understand so you can pull from your own knowledge to answer future questions. The best to you all! Thanks again Xypher.[/spoiler]",

It surely is an odd date, as GTA Online is being launched on the same day, which may affect the number of beta participants. The beta will be available on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. You'll be able to access the beta if you are a BF3 premium owner, preordered the Battlefield 4 Digital Deluxe edition or own the MoH Warfighter Limited Edition. Battlefield 4 launches on October 29 for current-generation consoles. \n\n[color=white][b]GTA - Amazon Street Date Broken[/b][/color]\nRockstar Games have announced that they are currently investigating recent early release breaches of the game GTA 5. It is reported that Amazon and another company in France broke the street date. \"We are in the process of investigating early 'sales' to determine how and why that is occurring,\" a Rockstar Games representative said. GTA 5 may already have enough pre-orders to break even on the development budget, however exact numbers have not been released. By the time you are reading this, GTA 5 would have already launched. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nCould Playstation block external recording devices?

Without being totally specific of what was done/accomplished in said snapshot, they did note that things were being added and bugs were being fixed. The only noticeable block addition, though, has been the sandstone slab. Though it's not too significant, surely the addition of new biomes will cover for it.\n\nVersion 1.6.3 (pre-release) amongst other snapshots are accessible via creating a new profile and enabling experimental versions. With such, version 1.7 is right around the corner.\n\n[b][color=white]Problems with Structure Data[/color][/b]\nWhile transitioning from 1.6 to 1.7 (or other experimental updates), there's been a problem with saving structure data (nether fortresses, strongholds, villages, etc.) in that the game doesn't properly carry them over from one version to another. Jeb, a popular Mojang developer, stated [url=https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/378070921917239296]in a Tweet[/url] that there's no easy way around it and that in order to make it work, a seemingly long route needs to be gone through. Surely enough, though, the issue is said to be fixed before 1.7's official release.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nWith HackerCraft being more active than it ever has been, its news will return along with it.

The six step framework agreed upon by the two world powers places a strict one week deadline for Syria to submit a \"comprehensive listing\" of all chemical weapons as well as agreeing to their destruction and UN inspections.\nThis agreement comes two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin [url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all]wrote an op-ed for the New York Times[/url] claiming \"there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces\". Putin's claim was disproved by a report by UN inspectors set to be released Monday, September 16th. The UN report will find that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapon attacks.\n\n[color=white][b]Flood Ravaged Colorado Leaves Four Dead and Hundreds Missing[/b][/color]\nBoulder, Colorado has seen up to 15 inches of precipitation since last Wednesday resulting in massive flooding and a hundreds of millions dollars worth of destruction. The current death toll is four, however a spokesman for the Larimer County Sheriff's Office warned reporters to expect the number to increase. The number of unaccounted people has decreased rapidly from nearly 500 on Sunday.\nThe State of Colorado has [url=http://www.helpcoloradonow.net/]set up an official website for anyone to help[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Measles Rates Increasing in the US[/b][/color]\nOnce believed to have been eradicated by the turn of the 21st century, measles is now making a comeback. In 2011, there were 222 reported cases and experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are concerned that 2013 will have even more. Health officials believe some parents' refusal to vaccinate their children is the major contributor to the recent outbreaks. Vanderbilt University's infectious disease expert Dr. Buddy Creech commented, \"This is very bad. This is horrible... The complications of measles are not to be toyed with, and they're not altogether rare.\" (via [url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/12/health/worst-measles-year/index.html]CNN[/url]).\n\n[color=white][b]Released Documents Further Embarrass the NSA[/b][/color]\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the Electric Frontier Foundation had their public records requests satisfied last Tuesday when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released 14 documents regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The documents may be found [url=https://www.aclu.org/nsa-documents-released-public-june-2013]here[/url].\n“These documents show that the NSA repeatedly violated court-imposed limits on its surveillance powers, and they confirm that the agency simply cannot be trusted with such sweeping authority,” said ACLU attorney Alex Abdo (via [url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-released-response-aclu-lawsuit]ACLU[/url]).\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]New iPhones Announced![/b][/color]\nWith news from Apple’s press conference on September 10th, two new iPhones have been officially announced. The two iPhones, the 5S and 5C, were announced with some basic information about them. The main features announced in the 5S were its fingerprint scanner and its motion-sensing chip (for use in fitness apps.) The 5C is the cheaper of the two, coming without the extra features that the 5S has. It's also going to be targeted at a younger audience and will be made out of colored plastic instead of aluminum. Both phones, however, will be released on September 20th with a price point of $99 and $199 respectively. \n\n[color=white][b]PayPal Changing Policies to Make Crowdfunding Easier.[/b][/color]\nPayPal isn’t known for helping crowdfunding, but they seem to be trying to change this with a recent announcement. The company has announced that at this time they are reworking policies to make crowdfunding easier. This will keep the freezing of funds to a minimum, as this has been a problem for startups using the commerce platform to fund themselves in the past. There is no word on what this will entail, but there are high hopes for it.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Coder Makes Developing for Raspberry Pi Simple[/b][/color]\nGoogle has launched a new service called Coder; the service aims to make coding easier for aspiring developers. Its main feature is its ability to develop apps for Raspberry Pi within your browser. This could be used as a testing platform for developers who have no money, seeing as the service is free. \n\n[color=white][b]Gold HTC One leaked[/b][/color]\nWith all the news about the gold iPhone, it shouldn't be a surprise that other manufacturers are following suit. Pictures were leaked online this week of a gold HTC One casing. The leak comes just days after the iPhone 5S was officially announced, leading some to believe that this golden phone is to compete with Apple's.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Ariana Grande on Vocal Rest Due to Hemorrhaged Vocal Cord[/b][/color]\nAriana Grande has severely damaged her vocal cords, and was recommended by her doctor to take a break from singing. This news comes in right after her album, [i]Yours Truly[/i], skyrocketed to #1 on the Billboard album chart. She has stated via Twitter, \"For those of u [sic] asking about my voice I screamed too much at my party totally irresponsible but it's better now, thanks for the well wishes\". This news is definitely going to slow down the momentum she has built; she is now forced to cancel many guest appearances and performances, including a performance on \"The Arsenio Hall\". Not to worry, though: she will be back to singing in less than four days. Ariana Grande's latest album has already sold over 130,000 copies, outselling R&B singer and reality TV star Braxton's \"Love and War\". Billboard has stated that Grande is the first female artist to top the chart with a debut album since Ke$ha's \"Animal\" in 2010. \n\n[b][color=white]Tyler, The Creator Releases Trailor to \"Wolf\".[/b][/color]\nTyler, The Creator has released a trailer for an upcoming film called [i]Wolf[/i]. Details are scarce, the film is rated “R” for “violence, grisly images, language, some nudity and sexuality.” The movie was put together by Tyler himself and named after his recent album, [i]WOLF[/i]. Tyler is expected to work under his Wolf Haley pseudonym. Tyler also Tweeted out: \"SINCE I DIDNT GET A VMA NOM IM [sic] FIGHTING FOR AN OSCAR ONE DAY WHO KNOWS THO ILL GET BETTER AS I GET OLDER\". At the end of the clip, it says \"COMING 201_\" which suggests a small chance that it could still come out this year. Tyler, the Creator already has a song on the new GTA V soundtrack. Check out the trailer [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-RGKEx3CN4][u]here[/u][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Kendrick Lamar Says Rappers Need Better \"Control\" Responses[/b][/color]\nWill the beef ever end? Kendrick Lamar mentioning out Meek Mill's response to \"Control\" was weak and stating, \"They gotta try harder\". Kendrick offered his thoughts on the artists he feels had the best “Control” responses, stating \"I liked the [King] Los verse,” Kendrick revealed. “Joe Budden did this thing, Joell; a lot of people with different approaches... Joey had the facts in his verse, a few things that he felt. Papoose had the comical joint. Los was flipping his words and putting that spunk on it. I think he had the killer thing though. Yeah, Los killed it out of everybody. But the number one joint at the top of the list had to be Chocolate Drop.\" New responses are pouring in every week, and the fire is just becoming bigger and stronger. Folks, this beef is just beginning and don't expect the fire to be extinguished soon.\n\n[color=white][b]Danny Brown Denied Entry to Canada[/b][/color]\nWas it the drugs, eh? Danny Brown was expected to perform in both Edmonton and Vancouver, Canada on September 11 and 12, but was denied entrance to Canada despite having the necessary paperwork. With two shows scheduled for next month in Canada, fans of Danny Brown have created a petition on [url=http://www.activism.com/en_CA/petition/allow-detroit-hip-hop-artist-danny-brown-into-canada-to-perform/45129][i]Activism.com[/i][/url] demanding that Danny Brown be allowed into Canada to perform. As of September 12, the petition is just short of 600 signatures with a goal of 10,000 signatures. Brown's album, [i]Old[/i], is expected to be released on September 30th and is creating global buzz, even featured on a \"Rolling Stones\" article.\n\n[color=white][b]Music of the Week:[/b][/color]\n[spoiler]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rh8yBJFsqY[/yt]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab9176Srb5Y[/yt]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfZoKiWZB-U[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nTechnology. Take a moment to think about where we are in the world today. Our progress, although minimal compared to the imaginations of Sci-Fi writers, is quite staggering. I am currently writing this portion of the HF News in a car going seventy miles per hour down a highway on an Acer C7 Chromebook, using the hotspot on my mobile phone. I mean \"wut.\" People used to rub rocks together to make fire, now we order fire over the internet. I often think about how far we would actually be set back during a world apocalypse, seeing as we rely so heavily on our tools of this Age of Information. We take too much for granted and ignore the basic skills/instincts that originally allowed us to survive as a species. I both yearn for and fear the future of our culture, as we are both an intelligent yet gullible people. Technology is beautiful, but it may lead to our demise through our increasingly internal dependence.",
