He has recently updated the [url=http://hackforums.net/misc.php?action=help]help documents[/url] to state the following, \"You can PM the admin Omniscient. Be warned. If you did not read fully this page and the rep left on your account was indeed within policy then you will get RepFucked without any hesitation. If you were left a scammer rep we may also do a full investigation of your account. If we find out you're breaking any site policies you will get a closed account.\" He stated he closes many accounts, a good chunk of which comes from account investigations relating to reputation abuse.\n\n[color=white][b]Crypto-currency Fraud Disallowed[/b][/color]\nThis week [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4265680&pid=40474105#pid40474105]announced[/url] that all forms of crypto-currencey related fraud is disallowed, previously it only stated Bitcoin fraud being disallowed. The help documents now state: \"We consider crypto currency an excellent choice for payments here on HF. And while they have no official government backing we feel they have value to this community. As such any cryptocurrency fraud will be considered financial fraud.

A report compiled by [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=608523][color=white]Sh1eld[/color][/url][/b], and corroberated by numerous members around the forum provided information that led to the closure of [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1983655][color=#383838]~OMC~[/color][/url][/b], and the month-long ban of [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1759389][color=black]Tenaxium[/color][/url][/b]. Despite this monumental hack, Omnicoin quickly rallied to substantially higher prices, perhaps proving that there is no such thing as bad publicity. \n\n[b][color=white]OMC Award Price Jumps[/color][/b]\nTo keep up with the fluctuating price of OMC, [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/url][/b] has changed the price for the OMC award to 2,500. This raises the question if the value of the award will fluctuate with the price in the future, or if it will remain constant at 2,500 OMC. \n\n[b][color=white]Overzealous Antiviruses Flagging Omnicoin-qt Binary[/color][/b]\nSeveral antiviruses, including Avast, TrendMicro-HouseCall, and several others have been flagging the Omnicoin-qt.exe file as general malware, or riskware. If this happens to you, be sure to submit it as a false positive to your vendor, which may be possible to do directly from the AV, or may have to be done from the vendor's website. Be sure to look up specific instructions for your antivirus.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yVoOuuj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4225262][b]World Cup 2014 Thread [Football/Soccer][/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1003315][b]Sanka[/b][/url] - This thread is packed with team spirit and conversation about the World Cup.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4238421][b][The Brotherhood] $500+ Contest | 1,000 OMC | Upgrade | LTC Awards | CashE[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=609911][b]Ridge™[/b][/url] - Yet another awesome contest brought to you by the generous members of Hack Forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4245196][b]I got an RFID chip implant[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=564566][b]PiraX[/b][/url] - This crazy kid took technology to a whole new level by implanting an RFID chip into his hand.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4096244][b]Favourite Football Team & Player[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2116966][b]ßetrayed[/b][/url] - In light of the World Cup approaching, here's another popular football thread.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4255932][b]Illness and Delays[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] - Our beloved Omniscient is sick and will mostly likely not be available the next few days.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4262068][b]So how much has HackForums made?

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] Alright before we begin I'd like to give a shout-out to those members whom I've known since the beginning of my HF 'career': Electrode, WiFi, Shady, Ultimatum™ and HardcoreSmasher who's gone but never forgotten.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] What would you say you are best known for on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] In the first couple of years I was known for monetizing. I did reselling/PPD-PPC-CPA/Affiliates/eWhoring/Site-Flipping etc. I then took a break for a few months when my partner (Electrode) and I decided it was best to start a legitimate business instead of engaging in questionable activities and that was when our company Camtrix was founded. Nowadays I would say I'm known for being a great businessman. I have a positive track record when it comes to currency exchanging as well as having successfully financed several products within HF which is what I'm most proud of.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of e-whoring, I see you run a service in this area. How successful would you say it has been?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to think that we are the most successful e-whoring business within HF. We cater to that specific market and along with my partner we've done a great job offering a variety of custom tailored products for our fellow e-whores.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] I did notice that the feedback on your account and thread reflect how successful it has been. Do you personally engage in e-whoring these days or just offer the service?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] I still e-whore every now and then just to stay updated with the new tactics and methods; however I'm more into the legit side of things nowadays.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] From what I understand, you are also someone involved in music and you even rap. How long have you been doing this for and do you do it just for fun or for other reasons?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I am. I've been songwriting for around 7 years. As for rapping, I've been known to dabble but I am no rapper whatsoever. A few years ago me and my buddy WiFi recorded some parodies for HF and I guess ever since people may perceive me as an 'rapper' which I am not. I'd like to think of myself more as an artist/songwriter.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] That is very interesting. Which bands or artists do you find inspire you the most?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] I'm very open to different genres. I will listen to anything if I feel it has rhythm. Some of my favorite bands/groups/artists vary from Evanescence, Epica, and Skillet to Sugarhill Gang, Run DMC, The Roots, Eazy-E, BDP and obviously the hip hop legends BIG, Jay Z, Vinnie Paz, etc.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any goals or milestones you have yet to accomplish or reach in regards to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] One of my goals is to own an official group someday and [i]maybe[/i] if I'm feeling generous I'll donate for MD sometime in the near future. I don't really aspire much on HF. My goal is to continue being a great business person and be the go-to guy for new members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] If you did own a group would it be focused around business and marketing? Do you have a name in mind?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] If i did it would be called \"NetFlirts\" and it would be an e-whoring dedicated group. I'm tired of seeing the same cycle of \"business & marketing\" groups. I think it's time for group leaders to think of fresh concepts or topics instead of merely adding 'sectors' or re-inventing the wheel.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] I believe a lot of HF members who are in groups share the same thoughts as you do. Is there anything we have not discussed that you'd like to bring up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] Umm, None that i can think of at this very moment.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] In that case, thank you for your time and responses! I appreciate it.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208][color=#EFEFEF][b]Darkwin:[/b][/color][/url] No problem. I'm glad to have been chosen to be a part of this segment and am looking forward to reading future HF News articles.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455]I Will Mashinate[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 197th edition of the HF News, today we're here with I Will Mashinate. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I'd like to give a shoutout to everyone in Instinct, Brotherhood, VinceVega, Icy, Jinx, Greatest and Kim for finally speaking on TS.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I see you do a product with Instinct, but you're not in the group. Why is that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] I recently made a community alert on one of the Instinct leaders, Craze. Im not gonna go to much in-detail on why I made this community alert however. I was kicked from Instinct for making drama out of this , and I have not had time to fully discuss my feature within Instinct with Vinnie, but I hope that my feature will still be with Instinct as it is a group I've had fantastic moments with.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's sad to hear and as an instinct member myself I was unaware of that. The group is a lot of fun if you can put up with the crazy antics of the members. So what do you do for Brotherhood? They have taken some interesting turns since I was last in the group and the new sector concept they use seems to be working.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] I was accepted into the PC gaming sector, and as of now it's very fresh and we're still getting to know eachother. However, we've had a few assignments so far which I really find interesting, I always like to share my knowledge with fellow gamers and to learn aswell. In the feature I will be looking to represent The Brotherhood in League of Legends matches, and to last but not atleast, play games with fellow Brotherhood gamers!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So it seems like you're big into PC, but do you play another other systems or consoles? If not what games do you play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] I've never had a passion for consoles. The last time I played on a console must be around two or three years ago when I was playing Ratchet & Clank for the childhood memories. But I mainly play on my PC, where I tend to play alot of different FPS games such as CS:GO, Battlefield and even the CoD games, im more of the person who likes to play the game for the story though, not for the multiplayer. I also love the MOBA game League of Legends, it's been a game I've been playing for roughly three years now, and to this day I still play it, not as much though. I've also played alot of DayZ, which is by far one of my favourite games, I love the aspect of a survival game.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm the complete opposite, outside of Minecraft I couldn't get into PC gaming. So tell me what's the meaning behind your username I Will Mashinate?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] My username has a long story behind it, alongtime ago I used to go by the name Mashinate, which was simply taken from a post I found on DontMashMe's facebook. I then felt that the username lacked something, and my creativity has always been poor and lacking, so I tried to gain some inspiration somewhere, and I went from IWMashinate to I Will Mashinate finally, with some good inspiration from I Will Dominate. It means really nothing, but I like the sound of it and I've stuck to it for ages now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well at least you have your own personal twist on it. So what do you do outside of the forums? Are you in school? Do you work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] Im currently studying, with roughly a year left to go to graduate. Im also considering to get a job, as im tired of living with my parents and would love to start building my life. However, I don't honestly do alot except school and my PC. I've always had a burning passion for competitive gaming though, so this is something I might persue if I get the motivation for it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What are you studying if you don't mind me asking?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] It's kind of hard to explain to be honest, but it's basicly the normal ammount of hours in each field, but with heavier English, Maths and Science in it. Right now im currently only doing English, Maths & Science though as it's only required to take one year of Norwegian, Gymanstics and something else which im not entirely sure what translates into.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds pretty interesting. So tell me how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] It was all pretty random if I was to be honest, along time ago my friends ratted me, and back then I had absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about how things worked, so I got curious but I lacked an interest, and it was a too big field to get into at that time being. A few years later I was trying to find a League of Legends community, and I got told by a friend that HackForums was an ok place, so I decided to give it a go. At the start it was really amazing, I actually enjoyed browsing the League of Legends section, but nowadays it's a section that is dead to me. The good quality discussions are gone, and replaced with script questions and other related hacking activites within League of Legends which im not really looking positively on.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] That's a bummer to hear. I feel the same way though, the community has changed and I do not like the direction they are going. How have the groups of Hack Forums impacted your overall experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] There's one group standing out to me, and that's Instinct. Instinct has been a home to me, and a family to me since I joined the group roughly half a year ago. We've had fantastic experiences together, and waking up hopping on TeamSpeak talking to these people is just something I appreciate to do in the morning. Lately im not really sure where it's been going though, but time will show I suppose. However I feel that most of the groups on HackForums isnt really doing anything at all, and is just really inactive. There's a few exceptions such as Null, MRT and Brotherhood but who am I to judge the other groups when I haven't even been in them? But to answer the question more directly, Instinct has definetly impacted by overall experience significantly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I don't like where groups have gone personally. If you could change one thing about Hack Forums what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] Definetly the League of Legends section, I would've disallowed all discussion about drophacking and scripts, however this is HackForums, I do understand that but I find it pretty pathetic to discuss and share cracked scripts and sell drophack methods. It ruins a game that is really good, and it ruins most of all your experience.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could rate your overall Hack Forums experience on a scale of 1-10, how would you rate it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] I would say 8/10. I've had fantastic moments in my first year here on HackForums, and I hope to have more amazing moments. However I feel the League of Legends section is just not fun to browse anymore, so that definetly lowers my overall experience. However, focus on the positive things!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well I think that's all the time I have for this interview and it's about time for me to head off to work. Do you have any concluding statements you'd like to make before we wrap this interview up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1832455][color=#EFEFEF][b]I Will Mashinate:[/b][/color][/url] It's been a pleasure to be interviewed, always love to read the interviews so will be special to see myself there now. But nothing imparticular I suppose. Please fix the League of Legends section? :)\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142]Goodies[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to this weeks edition of The HF News. Today I'm here with my good friend Goodies. How goes it? Do you have any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] Where do I begin? I've met so many members over the years. Special shoutout to DrDinosaur, _Silky, Tea., Aura, VipVince, RenRioku™, eiqhtworks, Abraluna, KevinMcCormick, Anonymous, and the rest!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Excellent. I'll just edit out 8works because he's a skid (jk love u). Now, I noticed you're very knowledgeable in the computer networking field. Where did you acquire your skills from?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] Thank you! That's much appreciated. Well, \"knowledgeable\" is, of course, a relative term. I make an effort to surround myself with people more intelligent than I in hopes to learn from them. I've taken various computer science courses as well as computer networking in my first year of college and I'm currently studying for the CCNA test that I'll be taking in approximately 3 months.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  I guess that explains why you talk to me all of the time. Best of luck with your CCNA test! I understand that you're working on an e-book, would you care to go into more detail?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] Thanks! I've spent the last 3 months working tirelessly on a book that is more or less a compilation of information I've learned over the years whether it be on HF, in class, or independently. I try to take esoteric concepts of networking and system security and break them down into something more palatable for members and readers with less experience.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's definitely a good approach to take! Those can be complicated subjects. I noticed you frequent the SRPP section regularly, more so to discuss Religion than anything else. Are you religious? Do you believe in a higher power? (Aside from Omni)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] Well, I was a Christian for several years. I was actually baptized (by choice) in the Baptist Church when I was 13 years old. At age 14 I began to \"question\" as they say. Now, almost 4 years later, I am an atheist. i'll refrain from bashing anyone's views here, but I simply do not see any evidence that supports a divine creator; much less one that is intimately involved with all of my daily affairs. However, as I've stated before, I am not allegiant to atheism but rather am allegiant to logic, evidence, and understanding. If I see sound evidence for the existence of a theistic god, I'd be more than willing to alter my views accordingly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  A very wise member once created this thread, which basically asks why everyone cares about religion so much. How do you feel about [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4236797][b]this[/b][/url] thread?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] A very wise member indeed. I don't necessarily have an answer for that question. I can look back and see that, as a child, I was indoctrinated by the Church and it's very likely that I hold resentments. In all honesty, I don't necessarily care what an individual believes, but I do feel that religion, though it has done several great things for society, sparks a huge amount of inequality and discrimination and I find that to be unfair.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  I agree 100%. If you could offer one piece of advice to the HF Community what would that be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] The HF community is so vast that there isn't one piece of specific advice that I feel would speak to everyone, but I would like to tell them to find an interest of theirs and continue with it. Speaking from experience, you're going to study the things that spark your interest. Find something about which you're truly passionate.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What other interests do you have aside from technology?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] As nerdy as it sounds, I've been studying Quantum and Bohmian Mechanics over the past year or so. I went to a lecture on Quantum Computing that impacted me greatly. Aside fro science and technology, I really enjoy just kicking back and coasting through life! Contrary to popular belief, I do have friends and I enjoy hanging out and partying with them as much as the next guy!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I don't buy that for a second. Are you a PC or a Mac guy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] I was, I suppose, a PC guy until I was introduced to Linux my freshman year of High School. Ever since then, I've been in love with Debian!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Oh man, not one of those guys. You know, I really don't understand the hype revolving around Linux. What's the deal with Linux? Why would anybody prefer that over Windows or Mavericks? I mean, you could argue that it's harder to get a virus on Linux but it's difficult to get a virus on Mac, and as long as you have some very basic knowledge about malware, you should be able to keep your PC clean too. BTW Mac is master race.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] There are several reasons why I prefer Linux over, say, Windows. As you hinted, Linux is much more secure than Windows. It is also far more customizable with hundreds upon hundreds of open source user-made distributions; you can be sure that there is one that fits you nicely. Another reason is that, with Linux, you have much more control over your machine than in a Userland like Windows! Finally, Linux has an amazing community always willing to lend a helping hand! Debian master race.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Fair enough, but don't you have to do so much more configuration/work with Linux?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] Often times, yes, but there are distributions that have the comfortable environment similar to that of Windows with the aforementioned assets of Linux.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I may have to try Linux out sometime then. Do you have anything against macs? I ask because most people do, for some stupid reason.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] Personally, I have nothing against Macs as I've never had an interest or need in purchasing such an expensive computer. How about yourself? You strike me as a fancy  Macintosh kind of guy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I just appreciate both good software and good hardware, I wouldn't expect a linux guy to understand. I'd like to thank you for joining us Goodies! Do you have any closing statements you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1173142][b]Goodies:[/b][/url] We simple minding Linux-folk can't understand. Anyways thank you very much for having me! I hope everyone enjoys HF as much as I have and I do hope to continue to be an active member for the foreseeable future. Also, a huge thanks to Sir for his time and dedication to the HF news![/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Welcome to this weeks edition of the news. We're here with Infamous' leader, Aurora. How are ya? How'd your exams go?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] Hello and thanks for having me! I'm doing great. My exams just ended and I finally feel a huge load off my back.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's awesome! Any shoutouts before we continue on with this interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, I'd like to give a shoutout to The Judge and Peter!\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Hello to them. How are you enjoying your new leadership in the Infamous? Care to share what you may have planned for the groups future?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] It's great in Infamous, everyone's pretty friendly there. As for the group future, I don't think there'll be a lot of changes, as I'm not the one who calls the shot.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Fair That's very true. Glad you're enjoying your new position. What brought you to this website? Being here for just about three years is definitely something notable.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, it's a really funny story. I was playing Habbo at that time and was on a forum that sell Habbo items. I got hacked during my time there. The hacker was kind enough to give it back to me, as well as handing over his name on Hack Forums if I ever wanted to contact him again. So, I joined and I talked to him for a bit and went out separate ways.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad Having the person who stole your stuff then give it back -- now that's different. Do you think that he still browses the board today? How was the forum back in '11 compared to how it is today?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] I lost his name so I'm not sure about that. As for the forum back in 2011, it's completely different. The theme has changed and most of the people I know back then have left the scene already. I even remember when there were less than 10 stressers on the market, haha.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Stressers and HackForums have both gone a long way in time. What does your offline/online hobbies consist of?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b] My online hobbies consist of pretty much just playing games and spending time on Hack Forums. I play DotA 2 and CS:GO. As for my offline hobbies, I recently picked up the guitar. I haven't practiced much though.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Acoustic or Electric? What year of school are you in currently? (Since, you did just have your exams!)\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] Acoustic. I don't follow the American education system, so we don't call it years. However, I'm taking my GSCE this year. I just finished up my Chinese written paper.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I've taken a spanish course and it was a struggle for me. Can't imagine how Chinese is. Anyways -- what's your honest opinion of the HF News team as a whole?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm failing Chinese though, haha. Hmmm, I believe the HF News team is pretty great. Everyone seems pretty chilled. (Except Renium, he's a noob.)\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Wish you the best of luck with your class! What's one piece of advice that you can give to a newcomer here on the forum?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] A new comer huh? Don't ask for reputation. I've seen countless of newcomers becoming douchey trolls after they ask for reputation and got negative one instead.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Very true. Thanks for spending time with us today, Aurora. Anything you'd like to say before we're officially done with this interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=888979]Aurora[/url]:[/b][/color] Everyone, stop mistaking me for Aura please! It's becoming an issue for both of us, haha.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

On Monday, the second of June, United States officials charged a man who they had suspected to be responsible for this massive theft. Fitting the stereotype perfectly, this Russian led an entire online crime syndicate designed to steal for people. These guys are the same people behind CryptoLocker, a truly new age malware which bested most security experts with respect to removal without harm. The United States goverment is being public with what this caused, saying, \"This operation disrupted a global botnet that had stolen millions from businesses and consumers as well as a complex ransomware scheme that secretly encrypted hard drives and then demanded payments for giving users access to their own files and data,\" Deputy Attorney General Cole said in a statement.\" While this all does sound amazing, it bares no true meaning. As aforementioned, they are Russian, which means they will not be extradited to the United States; however, this does set a fairly big precedent and adds to the tensions between the United States and Russia. \n\n[color=white][b]Companies are Investing in Security[/b][/color]\nFor many people in the security industry, they often times end up in security firms, but recently many very big companies have been creating paid roles such as chief information security officers. This role has been around for a while, but recently it has become in massive demand and companies are starting to see it as a smart investment. With college majors tied directly to computer security, it is becoming a sophisticated and prosperous field. With major companies like Target, eBay, and credit card companies getting hacked increasingly often, the business is beginning to take off. With salaries jumping 20-40%, it is creating even more competition. There is no decline, and malware writers are always working against them. \n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nSince this is Hack Forums, many of you are security conscientious users, and typically still fairly young. There are many security jobs out there, but they do require schooling. Security and Risk Analysis can end up giving you a middle to high 6 figure salary at a well known business. The field is constantly growing, and possibilities are endless. Take a moment and look into the numbers, it is a viable and interesting field to work in which applies to so many different things. From banks, to businesses, to even casual websites, security is a must. Therefor, there needs to be specialists.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Facebook-Integrated Bitcoin Wallet[/color][/b]\nA startup based in San Francisco called QuickCoin is planning to make Bitcoin viral by creating a 'social wallet' that lets users connected through Facebook send and receive Bitcoin through a simple interface. Quickcoin is integrating its product with Facebook in the hopes of Bitcoin becoming viral on the social network. Marshall Hayner, the co-founder of QuickCoin says that a social wallet for Facebook, seemed like the best start for a bitcoin company, since Facebook had around 1.28 billion users as of March 2014. Another reason for starting it, is the fact that most people haven't done enough research about bitcoin, and therefore avoids the hassle of using it, through this everyone can use bitcoin without any background knowledge.\n\n[b][color=white]Bitcoin Surges Past $600 USD[/color][/b]\nBitcoin has passed the $600 USD mark on May 30, after several weeks of declines and plateaus. A number of positive developments such as the successful Bitcoin2014 conference and DISH Network starting to accept Bitcoins, has over the past couple of weeks helped reverse the negativíty over Bitcoin. Bitcoin had a lot of negative coverage such as the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange so called Mt. Gox. However they're currently paling in comparison to what the Bitcoin market faced during November and December last year. Bitcoin compared to national currencies, still have significant swings, and it's still unknown whether this will be another short-lived spike.\n\n[b][color=white]Coinffeine: Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange[/color][/b]\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known as decentralized technologies, however the exchanges of today are nearly all centralized. A team based in Spain is hoping to change that by developing an open-source decentralized exchange algorithm. The purpose of Coinffeine is to have zero trust on the actual exchange, and ensure that users are always in control of their money, whether it be the local currency or Bitcoin.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Unexpected Death of a Loved One Linked To Onset of Psychiatric Disorders[/color][/b]\nResearchers at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and colleagues at Columbia's School of Social Work and Harvard Medical School have found out that the sudden loss of a loved one can trigger a variety of psychiatric disorders in people with no history of mental illness. While previous studies have suggested there is a link between sudden loss and an onset of common psychiatric disorders, this is the first study to show the association of acute bereavement and mania in a large population sample. Out of nearly 28,000 participants, researchers found that between 20% 30% see an unexpected death to be the most traumatic event in their lives. Of these, the risk to have a psychiatric disorder was nearly doubled. Moreover, those above the age of 50 had their risk five fold.\n\n[b][color=white]Girls' Social Connections Affect Math Learning[/color][/b]\nResearchers at the University of Illinois have found that the more girls interact and are socially connected, the more they enjoy learning math and are more likely to take advantage of learning opportunities. Through interviews, data collection, and observation the researchers found that the most successful students in the class were those who interacted with others the most. The girls that isolated themselves from everyone tend to do worse and were overall less confident, weren't as interested in class, and did not take advantage of academic opportunities. While the researchers don't know how this is caused for sure, one theory is that is it onset by the way society treats and sees women in education compared to men. \n\n[b][color=white]New Printable Robots Could Self-Assemble When Heated[/color][/b]\nScientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created new algorithms and electronic components which can enable printable robots that self-assemble when heated. Printable robots, made from 3D printers, have long been a topic of research in Computer Science labs at MIT. In two new papers, the researchers demonstrate the printable robotic components that, when heated, automatically fold into prescribed three dimensional configurations. The technology is being tested to see if other substances can eventually do the same, such as metal. \n\n[b][color=white]Green Tea Reduces Pancreatic Cancer Risk[/color][/b]\nA study recently published in the journal Metabolomics by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute explains how green tea changed the metabolism of pancreatic cancer cells. Green tea and its extracts have been widely touted as potential treatments for cancer, as well as several other diseases, but scientists have struggled to explain how the green tea and its extracts may work to reduce the risk of cancer or to slow it down. The study reports that EGCG, the active biologic component in green tea, changed the metabolism of pancreatic cancer cells by suppressing the enzyme associated with the cancer, LDHA.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]AT&T & Verizon Tied for Most Cellular Customers[/b][/color]\nVerizon and AT&T are probably the biggest cellular companies, and they have been in this position for a long while now. A strange thing happened in the first quarter of this year, in which the carriers pretty much had a tie for market share. It is said that AT&T and Verizon both had 34 percent of the US subscribers. Verizon was ahead for a while, but then AT&T caught up. This is attributed to AT&T buying leap and adding all of Cricket's customers to their side. There is also rumors floating around of Sprint acquiring T-Mobile, which could tip the scales in their favor. There is no clear winner as of yet.\n\n[color=white][b]Leak Shows That The Galaxy S5 Mini Will Possibly Keep The S5's Sensors[/b][/color]\nMost people obviously expect an S5 mini version to launch, but the one thing people are unsure of, is what it will include. Pictures received by SamMobile shows a Galaxy S5 Mini, heart-rate sensor and fingerprint scanner included. These features were a big thing on the larger version of the phone, and the fact that these photos show the sensors being included is a big thing for the mini phone. The pictures don't tell us much about anything else other than that it will include the Ultra Power Saving mode that the S5 has, and possibly a few other things. A lot of speculation is floating around about what the power of the phone actually is, but no solid confirmations yet. If you want to check out the photos, click [url=http://www.sammobile.com/2014/05/30/is-this-the-samsung-galaxy-s5-mini-sm-g800f/]here.[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]Google Wants People To Search While Driving[/b][/color]\nIt is becoming a trend now that new smartphones incorporate voice commands heavily, such as most Android devices allowing you to just say \"OK Google\" before you can start your voice search. These voice commands aren't exactly ideal for when you are on the road or preoccupied with other things, and you can't look at your phone. Google is supposedly testing a new feature they are calling KITT, which would help you focus on driving while using the internet. The system would allow you to do anything from surfing the web to sending a text message without having to touch or look at your phone. The system would also read back your search results much as it would when you're doing a normal voice search. This is all a rumor as of right now, but it may come to fruition soon. \n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

The EULA states that Minecraft users \"cannot make money with Minecraft\" without the permission of Mojang. This statement prohibits the sales of mods and plugins, but also undermines what practically every large server owner currently achieves using Minecraft, which is profit. It is widely known that servers cost money and time to maintain, and that larger servers require more money. Server owners generate this money with donations; these donations, however, are more often than not purchases towards in-game perks that give players special privileges, in-game money, or access to new content. Purchased perks often benefit both the player and the owner, as the owner gains money to fund the server and the player gains perks to enhance gameplay. An example of this is HackerCraft and the Pow3r rank - players purchase the rank and help fund the server, and in return gain access to new commands and features. Mojang's Erik Broes, a Minecraft developer who is active within the community, stated recently that paid perks are not allowed under the guise of donations or otherwise. Brose states that \"if you are on a server, your experience should be the same as every other player.\" According to the EULA, server owners are allowed to accept donations but are not allowed to grant in-game perks in return. Mojang plans to contact monetizing server owners regarding the issue; Broes says \"We'll ask nicely and then send really mean lawyers. :)\"\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yMU9Olr.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Volcano Cancels Australian Flights[/b][/color]\nAustralian flights cancelled, because of volcanic eruption The Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Northern Australia considers the activity in Indonesian volcano, Mount Sangeang Api to be a \"sustained, rather significant eruption\". The Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Warren Truss, says it will be many days for air services in Australia to begin their normal schedules again. The vast amount of activity, given the wind conditions, even has the potential to cause cancellations as far southeast as Brisbane, Australia.\n\n[color=white][b]U.S Soldier Freed From Taliban[/b][/color]\nAfter five years of detainment, Sergeant Bowe Bergahl was released today from Taliban troops. The rescue operation was peaceful and Bergahl was released in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees. President Obama stated  that \"While Bowe was gone, he was never forgotten\". It was a fairly large operation involving the Special Forces, White House National Security Team, and the Qatar government. Bergahl was the only remaining U.S soldier captured during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n[color=white][b]Ukraine's President vows vengeance over helicopter attack[/b][/color]\nUkraine's president Petro Poroshenko has vowed to punish the people responsible for shooting down a military helicopter. Ukraine's president stated that \"While mourning with the rest of Ukraine, I give my condolences to the families and loved ones of the fallen heroes. Crimes of the bandits will not be left unpunished.\" Rebels claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter. This incident is part of the recent separatist unrest within the region. Ukraine plans to continue its \"anti-terrorism\" operation until the region is fully stabilized.\n\n[color=white][b]Pele's Son Sentenced to 33 Years in Prison[/b][/color]\nAhead of the World Cup in Brazil, Pele's son Edinho has been sentenced to 33 years in prison after being found guilty of money laundering. Pele is a world renowned footballer who won the World Cup with Brazil 3 times and has scored an astonishing 1,200 times in his career, and his son followed in his footsteps becoming a professional footballer for the same club Pele played for.

Edinho has also been involved in drug trafficking before with arrests made in 2005 but pleaded innocent.\n\n[color=white][b]UKIP Win UK European Elections[/b][/color]\nFollowing on from [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4247576]last weeks report[/url]; United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) begin to gain momentum ahead of the 2015 UK general elections by winning the European elections. UKIP's 27.5% victory means that this is the first time a party other than Labour or Conservatives have won the election in 100 years and Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, believes this will give the party the \"momentum\" to win the 2015 elections. What does this mean? UKIP now have seats in the European Parliament, meaning they have a small voice, but the vote can be seen more as a 'popularity contest' for the 2015 general elections and an idea of which party could win. \n\n[color=white][b]Woman Sentenced to Death for Apostasy[/b][/color]\nOver the last few weeks an astonishing story has been developing as a woman from Sudan has been sentenced to death for Apostasy. Meriam Yahya Ibrahim, was raised a Christian by her mother but her father was a Muslim. Ibrahim would not denounce her faith in Christianity and was sentenced to death along with 100-lashes for adultery. Ibrahim was forced to give birth to her child last week by having her legs chained open. She will now be allowed to raise her child for another two-years before she is executed. The decision has been highly disapproved across the world and there are many appeals to reverse the decisions but so far Sudan has not budged on their decision.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ndzWS1q.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Wiz Khalifa Arrested[/b][/color]\nRapper and known marijuana user, Wiz Khalifa, was arrested for marijuana possession in Texas.
