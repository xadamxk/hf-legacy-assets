Over the couple of weeks it was open there were many applications submitted but only 25 were accepted. The recruitment closed on January 1st, 2015 and the official release of the academy was January 13th, 2015. This is great news as this will be extremely beneficial to Hack Forum's community that are in need and those who would like to learn. If you'd like to read the official launch thread you may do so, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4632365]here[/url].\r\n\n[color=white][b]Help the HackerCraft Community[/b][/color]\r\nOn January 9th, 2015 the new HackerCraft server was launched by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1180981][color=#00AAFF][b]Edward Snowden.[/b][/color][/url], however only a few days later the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1508659][color=#EFEFEF][b]Detoxicate[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread stating that after the first day or two the server had died back down. Either HackerCraft needs some fresh ideas or it should go back to its roots seeing multiple people have posted saying they liked the simplicity better.

We're joined with Nehssa, how are you doing?\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm great, thanks for asking! How about yourself?\r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Awesome like usual. Any shoutouts before we begin?\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah! I'd like to give a shout out to all the members in Phoenix, they're such a lovely group of people. I love them all. \r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] To start things off, why'd you sign up for HF? What convinced you to join?\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color] I was actually on Twitter one day and I saw an article about hackers getting into people's computers and being able to control them, see what they're doing, etc. I thought to myself, \"Okay, that's crazy.\" A quick google search of RATs and I ended up on the forum. I saw the forum as a really informative place, and I was pretty interested in the topics that others discussed on the forum. So I decided to stay. \r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What's the one thing that stands out to you that other forums don't have?\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color]  Definitely the diverse community. There's so many users from around the world, so many different types of people, so many different personalities. I think it's really cool. After a while, HF gave me this great feeling of belonging, even in such a large community.\r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What do your hobbies consist of when you're not online?\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color]  I usually go out with friends, write, play video games, read, or go somewhere random and just explore the area. I'm also trying to pick up other hobbies like voice acting and video making. \r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Have you met anyone in real life that browses this board?\r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color] I have not, actually. I wouldn't mind, though. That would be really awesome! \r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  What does your alias mean to you? \r\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b][/color]  I've had Nehssa since I was 12 years old. I even have some friends IRL that call me Nehssa as well. Anyways, I was trying to think of a unique username for myself, and so I just picked Nehssa. My name is Vanessa, so I just took my nickname 'Nessa' and put an 'h' in between it. When I was younger I was hoping I would become famous and be known by my alias, haha. \r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  What's your opinion on the podcast with Omniscient (or the Omnicast) that happened about a week or so ago. Did you watch it? \r\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b] I did watch it! I really enjoyed it. I honestly didn't know Omni that well other than what he looks like and he's a guy you should not piss off, haha. I had never heard his voice before, and it gave me a lot more insight into who our admin really is. He seems like a great person to talk to, honestly. I wouldn't mind chatting with him in real life. I especially liked the bit about groups, seeing what he expected from the groups. I also had a good laugh when you guys cracked some jokes, it made me feel like I was there with you guys! It seemed like a really personal experience to me. Great job!\r\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Thanks for taking the time out of your day to chat with me. Anything you'd like to say before we're done with this interview? \r\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1716499]Nehssa[/url]:[/b] No problem, and thank YOU for interviewing me! It truly is an honor. I would just like to say I hope anyone who is reading this has a great day, and remember to tell someone you love them.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529]Kouichi[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to this week's edition of the HF News, today we're joined by Kouichi. How's it going man?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty good. :D Just woke up like 2 hours ago so nothing's really happened today. How about you?\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm enjoying a long weekend off of school, thanks for asking. Are there any shoutouts you'd like to give?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Let's see. Shout out to Litecoin because I was a better choice than him. Shout out to Spyro the Indian, Vinnie, and the other Nightfall members. Also all the weeaboos that post in AA. That's about it.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Would you consider yourself to be an avid anime fan?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] I'd consider myself an avid fan of anime for many reasons. It's pretty much the only thing I watch. My online aliases are based of anime characters. Whenever I have free time, I'm watching anime or something related to anime. A lot of people call it \"tentacle porn\" and such while hating it and those that watch it but if they give it a try and genuinely watch an anime, they'll see it's not all that bad.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm guessing that's in response to how people feel about the new anime group right? Are you a part of their squad?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Not really, just in response to people in general that have that kind of view on anime and people that watch anime. I'm not apart of their \"squad\" or group, I applied but wasn't accepted. Sometimes I wonder if it's because I got into an argument with Tweety. one time because I posted a screamer at like 2AM and now he hates me lol.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of groups, how do you feel about all these new ones popping up recently?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Nothing's wrong with them in my opinion. It's nice to see some new groups based on other things than marketing like how Echo is based on SST and general hacking.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed. If you owned a group, what would you make it about? \r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] I've never really thought about what I'd do if I owned a group lol. I guess I'd make it something like Nightfall, just a laid back group to have fun in and chill. Either that or a group based on giving back to the community with things such as help desks, tutorials, giveaways, etc.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] It seems like everyone is trying to do that to be \"HQ.\" And Nightfall is definitely one of the more popular groups. How would you describe all the craziness that happens in the subforum to an outsider?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Lol, I can't even explain it. It's too much going on. Every thread is like a party you just can't leave. If I ever want to laugh, I just go through posts in the subforum. It's definitely my favorite group. The members, posts, etc. are hilarious inside the subforum.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm glad to be a part of it. How were you introduced to Hackforums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest, I started off looking to leech from the forums. Before I was active, I was into Runescape private servers and gaming. I was in a Skype group chat with some gaming friends and one of them was talking about how they just hacked a 14K Twitter. So I PMed him asking how he did it and he told me he keylogged him using a keylogger on HF. The keylogger he referred me to was Dracula Logger. Then I wanted to give back to HF so I posted a really detailed tutorial on the keylogger (the owner requested me to remove it a while ago for some reason) and then I became pretty active after that moment.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] What made you stay here until today?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Uh, at a point, I was semi-active, getting around 5-10 posts a day in different threads trying to joke around and have fun. Then I started getting more interested in the marketplace as well and started selling things. I've sold eBooks and doxing services before. I still have a service going on now. Now, I'm active because the community. It's like a drug, you know? I can't seem to stop posting and being active lol.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I guess that makes you a HF addict. What do you do outside of the forum?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] I guess you could say that. As for outside the forum, when I'm not at school, I'm with my friends or my girl. When I'm with friends, we're either hanging out and just chilling, partying, or playing football/basketball. Basically I have average days lol.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm quite a big fan of sports myself. Who do you see winning this year's Super Bowl?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Ironically I don't really watch football. Again, most of what I watch is anime so I don't usually watch anything else or keep up with anything. I just really enjoy playing it a lot. It's a lot better than watching it. :P\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's the case with most sports. Anyway, thank you for joining me. Is there anything else you'd like to say before we conclude this interview?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2300529][color=white][b]Kouichi:[/b][/color][/url] Right. But yea. Everyone that reads this should PM Litecoin (UID=1748669) telling him Kouichi was a better choice than him and will always be better in life since he doubted me. That's about it lol.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

Illegal wiretapping and information gathering on citizens have become the punch lines of hacker jokes around the world. The NSA has recently reported that it has made a \"regrettable move\" by pushing American business towards insecure cryptography solutions. The NSA was in wide support of Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual EC DRBG) which was a random number generator used for encryption. The company RSA, thanks to the endorsement of the NSA, incorporated Dual EC DRBG into their \"BSafe\" technology, despite having been told by both Microsoft and private security researchers that the algorithm was likely backdoored. Allegations against RSA for having been paid $10 million by the NSA in order to push this flawed algorithm have been denied, but in a document released by Edward Snowden, it was shown that the NSA and RSA were even more closely related than we'd originally thought. Further investigation is currently taking place, but it if very likely that the NSA knowingly endorsed an unsafe encryption standard.\n\n[b][color=white]Verizon Users at Risk of Tracking[/color][/b]\nAn online advertising company, called Turn, that is widely used by Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and several other highly esteemed companies is using a widely controversial internet cookie that \"comes back from the dead\" after it is deleted. Tracking cookies can be used for location information and general data about the phone and its user. Turn has been taking advantage of a hidden phone number that is normally used by Verizon to monitor customers' smartphone habits. Turn is using this phone number to resurrect deleted tracking cookies and allowing private information to be sent to the aforementioned companies. This so-called \"zombie cookie\" is apart of a controversial new form of tracking currently being deployed by the telecom industry and both Verizon and AT&T users are being forced to send tracking data even without allowing it.\n\n[b][color=white]Swedish Activist WiFi Hack[/color][/b]\nA Swedish activist, Gustav Nipe, who is also the chairman of the youth wing of the Swedish Pirate Party, attacked a major Swedish security and defense conference. He successfully set up a network with an SSID \"Open Guest\" and monitored the traffic. Several hundred politicians, military officers and journalists connected to this rogue WiFi network and had large amounts of information gathered. This attack was meant to be a protest against mass digital surveillance and Nipe essentially wanted to give the politicians \"taste of their own medicine\" and wanted to show civilians what it'd be like if they were constantly watched by authorities. Nipe is most famously known for his involvement in the Pirate Party’s efforts to create its own Internet Service Provider (ISP) back in 2010, and he also founded the Church of Kopimism, a religion centered around copying of information which is ostensibly believed to be Holy. The Church of Kopimism was formally recognized by Swedish tax authorities in 2011.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vquwXAz.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91531]ven0m[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=610658]Junkie™[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler= ][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]American and United Airlines Account Miles Hijacking[/color][/b]\nUnited and American Airlines' security was breached by crooks with stolen usernames and passwords. According to the associated press report, around 10,000 customers' accounts were compromised and the intruders have gotten away with free trips and upgrades. No other information such as tax ID numbers, credit-card numbers was stolen but the company has urged its clients to change their passwords for other sites to minimize the damage. \n\n[b][color=white]Instagram Fixes its Private Photo Bug[/color][/b]\nEarlier, a bug on Instagram was detected which allowed user to view any photos and videos with their direct URL even if the profile was private. This bug was detected by the online publication, [url=http://qz.com/323307/instagram-privacy/]Quartz[/url]. Though Instagram reports that the bug has been fixed, you can still view images from Instagram if they have been shared on other social networking sites regardless of Instagram's privacy setting. If you wish to share you private photos, think again before doing so.\n\n[b][color=white]Malware Developers Release CryptoWall 3.0[/color][/b]\nAfter a short break, the malware developers have released their new variant of ransomware called CryptoWall 3.0. Other than new ransom note on file name, new TOR gateway and extended deadline for ransom, it is hardly different from its predecessor, CryptoWall 2.0. Please practice safe browsing habit on Internet to be on the safe side.\n\n[b][color=white]Google Leaks Windows Vulnerability — Microsoft Not Happy[/color][/b]\nGoogle is under scrutiny by Microsoft for publicly disclosing a vulnerability in Windows 8.1 that if exploited, allowed regular users to become administrators. Microsoft was due to release a patch two days before Google made the exploit public though Microsoft failed to fix the issue in the allotted 90 day deadline. Chris Betz, senior director of the Microsoft Security Response Center, states that customers should be the primary focus and making the vulnerability public put many people at risk. Betz believes that it is best to privately solve these problems than it is to give the public full knowledge of something that could be exploited before the patch is released. You can read more about his proposed method, Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, in his [url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2015/01/11/a-call-for-better-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure.aspx]blog[/url]\n\n[b][color=white]Undetectable Keylogger Can Record Wireless Keyboard Strokes[/color][/b]\nIt is well known that wireless technology has its dangers, but could wireless keyboards actually present a security risk? A new keylogger named KeySweeper, released by Samy Kamkar, could be confirmation. Masked as an USB wall charger, KeySweeper connects to nearby Microsoft wireless keyboards, records keystrokes then sends the logs back to the user. KeySweeper can even send SMS alerts when certain keywords are typed; this feature could make it easier for intruders looking to steal certain data. This kind of technology has partly been made possible because of a weak encryption method for the keyboards which the Keysweeper team was able to exploit. Those interested will be glad to find that Kamkar has released the source code along with instructions on how to be build your own.\n\n[b][color=white]9 Bugs Fixed in Firefox 35[/color][/b]\nThe latest version of Mozilla Firefox fixes 9 vulnerabilities. One piece of malware, sandbox escape, can break out of the Gecko Media Plugin sandbox. This allows the attacker to avoid the sandbox which protects users from malicious applications. Linux users were not at risk though as it only affected Windows systems. There was also a bug reported that could lead to privilege escalation. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/pUq7c18.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=981500]Premortal[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Rare NES Game Reaches $32,000 at Auction[/color][/b]\nThe extremely rare NES game Stadium Events is currently up for auction on eBay with the current highest bid being $32,252. The current owner was a Nintendo employee when he procured the game and has had it since the 1990's. It was around 2011 when the owner realized how much money the game was worth, but he was unable to sell it due to Nintendo company policy saying he could not sell the game for profit. It was only after he left in 2012 that he became allowed to sell the game. Due to fraudulent bids of over $100,000 bidding has been restricted to pre-approved buyers.\n\n[b][color=white]Grand Theft Auto V PC Release Date Pushed Back[/color][/b]\nThe new release date for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is March 24th. The following is the full statement regarding the delay, found on the official [url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire]Grand Theft Auto V Newswire[/url].\"Our apologies for the slight shift in the date but the game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as can be. Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and is a choice we make only when we know it is in the best interests of the game and our fans. Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March.\" Some of the extras to be included in the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V are a 4K resolution and a built-in video editor. \n\n[b][color=white]Metroid Prime Trilogy to be Re-Released on Wii U[/color][/b]\nThe acclaimed Metroid Prime Trilogy is set to be re-released on January 29th on the Wii U. The original Metroid Prime Trilogy has climbed to prices of over $100 for pre-owned copies on eBay. This comes as part of Nintendo's larger plan to release successful Wii titles as downloadable on the Wii U. Other games included in this plan are Super Mario Galaxy 2, available now, and Punch-Out, available January 22nd. Each game of the Metroid Prime trilogy will be $10 the first week of re-release and $20 thereafter.\n\n[b][color=white]Soon You Will Be Able To Post Screenshots On the Xbox One[/color][/b]\nThe Xbox one will be releasing a feature that will let you take screenshots like the Playstation 4 already has since the features' release in November, 2013. This feature will be releasing early this year. The ability to take screenshots and share them has been in production for a couple of months and it is believed to take a couple more till' the official launch.

What is known, is that Spartan will have the look and feel of the more lightweight programs like Google Chrome and Firefox while still having the integrated features of a Windows standard web-browser. For example, the new browser will likely support annotations on the webpage itself, which in turn can be sent to friends or colleagues. Another possible feature is that of grouping tabs; work, play, pictures, would be easily set to the user's convenience for easy access and mobility. The expected showcase of Windows 10 is on January 21st.\n\n[color=white][b]Macs Vulnerable to Virtually Undetectable Virus that \"Can't Be Removed\"[/b][/color]\nA possible Mac vulnerability code-named \"Thunderstrike\" has been discovered by Trammell Hudson, security researcher for Two Sigma Investments, which \"installs a malicious code into the Boot ROM via Thunderbolt port.\" Esentially, the thunderport gives the malicious code access on boot, and because it's basically the first OS X firmware bootkit, nothing is scanning for it. This allows the exploit to log keystrokes, place backdoors, as well as bypass firmware passwords. Incredibly, it's also difficult to remove. \"It can't be removed by software since it controls the signing keys and update routines. Reinstallation of OS X won't remove it. Replacing the SSD won't remove it since there is nothing stored on the drive.\" Fortunately, Apple is currently working on an update to prevent this from happening, however, this update won't protect the system from having the Boot ROM tampered with directly.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
