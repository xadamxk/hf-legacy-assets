[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] created a group strictly for trainees, as opposed to the previous HF MRT group, which still exists, but is for the graduated and higher tier members. The MRT Trainee group doesn't consist of a user bar at this point in time, and this likely will not change as when members are in this group they are simply training to become an official MRT member. The group can be seen by viewing the show groups page by [url=http://hackforums.net/showgroups.php][b]clicking here[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Entire Country Israel Blocked [/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] recently announced via twitter that the entire country of Israel is blocked due to ongoing attempts to attack or harm HackForums in some shape or form.

Today we have the pleasure of interviewing the known anime fanatic and leader of the unofficial group, AnimeFAN!, Happeh for the 156th edition of HF News! Before we get started, are there any shout outs you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]Want to just give a shout out to all my friends over in Anime Adventures; those guys are the bomb and have made a home away from home. Also, to S70N3R.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]AA is a wonderful place; it's really brought me together with a lot of members. :3 Oh and S70N3R, oh S70N3R.. I miss that little trouble maker. He does get unbanned in about a month though, hoping he comes back after it. Anyways, how did you make your way to and get your start on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]I loved S70N3R like a brother, he was always there for me. Like most I started HF in the search of the latest and greatest hacks; for me it was to hack a forum that had done me wrong. Upon arrival though I noticed the community was super friendly, and it was fun to be around. After posting around a little I settled in the PS3 community, making a few friends, I was soon bored though until I laid eyes on AA. Ever since my first post, it's been an adventure with its ups and downs and I've loved it the whole way.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]He was a great guy, especially when drunk. So with your love for AA, you eventually created AnimeFAN! What inspired the group's creation?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]The groups inspiration was originally by a member called \"Taiga\". He had created some mock designs for a userbar for anime anime group called \"anime fan\". I contacted him saying these were awesome and that we should actually start an anime group, specially since there really hadn't been any! After some discussion we left the name as anime fan but stylized it as \"animeFAN!\" or \"aF\"; after that it was the overwhelming community support and love for the group that we continued with it and even today it's still around. It has to be one of my most prized possessions on HF, it has more active members than most groups and has been around longer than most of the paid groups!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]If memory serves me correctly, the only groups that are still around that have been here longer than it are The Alliance and possibly Red Lions. I remember leading U.L.L.F. with Tasemu and it merging with you guys which was a long while back. When aF first came about, what was the goal behind it? I'm sure part of it was to create more activity in the sub-forum.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]I feel safe to say it was before Red Lions as well, though like you my memory is a bit fuzzy. The merge was a little bit of a mess, it came from no where and not much really changed accept we now had a ranking system and yourself and Tas become leaders, but again like with most groups, slowly Leaders left and came back and currently it's just me. The original goal for the group was to create more activity within AA and to just unite all the anime fans in the section into one fun group. I feel we did a fairly successful job too, with lots of community driven projects, competitions and such appearing along with 1/3 of the threads being animeFAN related, it was a joy to watch.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]I remember when you couldn't go more than two threads without seeing an aF thread. Now that time has gone on, what are your current projects and goals here on HF; as well as offsite?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]The current project for me is to get back to a stage where I'm happy on HF, before I used to be in several groups, friends with quite a few members and even led a group. This all changed though and I became a bit of a shriveled old lonely man. So I guess become more \"HQ\" (though I hate that phrase!) Offsite I want to become more prominent in my moderating position on a rather large Youtube Network's forum, push my personal Youtube further and then just every day kid stuff; looking at Universities, become better at the instruments I play, that sort of thing!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Very impressive! You have a lot on your plate! I didn't know you played instruments! >:o What ones do you play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]Ha, I play Guitar, Ukulele and Bass. I work in a music store though and get to play very unique and expensive instruments almost everyday! It won't sound much to most but I was allowed to play a 65' Fender Jaguar, which are around £3k each and rare. Was one of the greatest days of my life. c:\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]That must have been a truly wonderful experience. Now, you mentioned that you moderate a Youtube Network's forum. What's that like and how did you manage to get a position like that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]I got the position by being active and generally friendly. When the forums first started it was just a few members, and one Staff. After some time they became more and more popular and are probably one of the most popular universal Youtube networks around, bringing in thousands of partners, and so one staff couldn't handle it, she had noticed I was active and willing to help and was asked. I jumped on the opportunity as not only is it good experience, it also sounds impressive: \"Hey, I moderate a multi-million dollar companies forum.\" I'll get all the ladies with that. It's scary to moderate though, due to its size and the feeling of knowing I may cock up at any moment. I've met some great people though and my confidence/knowledge builds everyday so its worth it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Someone's rollin' in the pussy. 😅 That's a really wonderful opportunity you have been given. Other that moderating that forum, anime, HF, and playing those intsruments, what else do you enjoy doing in your free time?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]Nothing too interesting, just the usual: hanging out with friends, playing video games, watching Suits.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Very fun. As a gamer, how into the whole Osu! fandom that runs rampant through the anime world are you? From the little bit I've played with Tasemu, it was quite fun; though quite challenging.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]Personally I'm not too invested in it, though I'm very impressed with people who are and who're great at it. I'm decent at most games but Osu! was one that I always fell short at. The memories I had of it were always Skype calls with Mute and us both failing hard at it. What's awesome about Osu! though is it isn't just an \"anime rhythm\" game, lots of popular songs have been covered too so it's accessible to everyone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]It truly is a wonderful game for all. I was always surprised by how many mainstream songs and different genre's were available. Anyways, sadly this is all the time we have for today. Are there any last remarks you'd like to share?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279955][color=white][b]Happeh: [/b][/color][/url]Want to go out sometime?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Ju no i do bby<3 And there you have it folks.

Today I'm going to be interviewing KostyDays; he may seem like a new member to some, but I assure you he's quite a cool guy. How are you doing today?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: Hey Connected, I'm good! I got a job at a record company near me as a designer and I'm pretty happy about it! How about you?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I'm doing very well; busy as always. When and why exactly did you join Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: I joined Hack Forums July 20th 2011. The reason I joined was because I wanted to get myself into hacking and growing contacts on the internet. But 1 year later, I found myself in the monetizing section. And it's going great, lets hope it will go on like that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: What section is the most unique to Hack Forums in your opinion?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: Definitely Monetizing, many people may disagree with me. But when you think about it how creative people on Hack Forums are to come up with methods out of the blue. Although some people steal other methods.. But there are many methods/ideas out there that are original with alot of potential. If you think of how much you can earn by just sitting behind your computer.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: I personally think it's the marketplace; you'll find no similar marketplace anywhere online. Anyways, what are your current goals on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: My current goals are, to improve my skills,  gain experience,  knowledge and contacts. Anything that might help me in the future. I'm open for anything.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: Which skills are you trying to improve? Which do you already master?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: The main skills I want to improve are my monetizing skills, social engineering and graphic designing. I've mastered them all but I'm not close to perfect yet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: What are your current projects right now, besides being a support member for iMoney sales?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: My current projects are kinda secret at the moment, but it includes offering people a service and product. Also, I'm in the process of starting a CPA/PPD (I don't have much info to share about it at the moment). I also got hired as a Graphic Designer at a record label/agency, so that will also keep me busy for a while.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: That's a great milestone, I hope you do good work there! Do you have any actual feedback on HF you'd like to share with the readers?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: Well I do have a few things I'd like to have changed. For example, I've seen many scam reports that aren't getting resolved like they should. And also Hack Forums needs to get rid of all the people that come by for 5 minutes.. rip content and leave. What belongs to Hack Forums must stay on Hack Forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: Sadly we can't control that. I, as an active old member and a forum owner (on another site) understand how hard it is to control scam reports. You just need to know who you're dealing with and really watch out. Anyhow, enough about HF. Do you have any IRL hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: Well I don't have really hobbies, but I have things that I like to do such as working out(4-5 times a week), learning, Going out with my friends(every Friday or Saturday or both. When it's vacation it's different.), Music, Graphic Designing, Photography, Being Social(Meeting new people), keeping my gf satisfied(If ya'll know what I mean) and much more things. Too many to write down :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for taking part in this interview Kosty! Any final words to close up this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898564][b]KostyDays[/b][/url]: You're welcome Connected. And not alot, except for the people that come for 5 minutes to rip some of the content and leave.. \"Go F*CK yourselves.\" and for the people that are being fair, honest and hard working.. Stay doing what you're doing and do what you think is the best.\n[/spoiler]",

Games for Windows Live will continue to operate, however Microsoft encourages users to spend their Microsoft Points before they retire. \"We encourage you to spend your Microsoft Points balance prior to this change. Although you will not be able to purchase new games, you can continue to enjoy previously purchased content by downloading it through the Games for Windows Live client software as usual.\" \n\n[color=white][b]Xbox One Controller For PC[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft told CVG in an interview that they are working on PC compatibility for the Xbox One controller and should be ready sometime in 2014. The software will allow Xbox One controllers to work seamlessly with games, including ones designed for the Xbox 360 controller. \"As we've stated, the Xbox One controller, although it looks similar in many ways, shares no underlying technology with the current Xbox 360 controller. New wireless protocol, combined with the ability to work in 'wired' mode, and the addition of features like Impulse triggers, means that new software has to be written and optimized for the PC,\" said the rep. \"There is also some work that we need to do to make sure that existing PC games that support the Xbox 360 controller, will work with the Xbox One controller. While it seems trivial, it's actually quite a bit of dedicated work for all that to be seamless for the user,\" they went on to explain. \"We know people want to use the Xbox One controller on their PC, and we do too - we expect to have the functionality available in 2014.\" The Xbox One will be available in November - an exact release date has not been announced. \n\n[color=white][b]Halo 4 Update and New Map Pack[/b][/color]\n343 Industries are set to release another title update to the game Halo 4.

The app now features dynamic time, and in that there's now a sun and a moon with stars. Players now experience night and day in a whole new way. Quart slabs have also been added for players to further build their white-themed constructions. Lastly, players can now use double chests with the newest update.\n\n[b][color=white]Variations to Current Biomes[/color][/b]\nNot too long ago, Mojang developers had mentioned the upcoming release of newer biomes. Unsure of how many would be included, they had just mentioned some modifications to the ocean biome with the addition of perhaps a few more. However, on August 16th, Jeb (a renowned Mojang developer) had stated that in addition to the implementation of new biomes, there would be variations of the older (current) biomes. The only information of said announcement can be found in [url=https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/368278005975879680]a Tweet made by Jeb[/url].\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color][color=white]'s Departure[/color][/b]\nAfter its run as Hack Forums' official Minecraft server, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1]Omniscient[/url] has decided that it is time the server came to an end. He stated that after a while, the server was just taking up too much time and resources and it just wasn't worth it due to its lack of activity. Giving everyone a sufficient warning, he's given players a one month notice before shutting the server down for good.\n\nOmniscient had stated that he's willing to sell the server for the right price, but at the same time doesn't guarantee that that's going to happen. Not much else has been said, but you can read the official thread (in addition to some important posts inside of it) regarding the announcement [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3688111]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]McMini[/color][/b]\nMcMini is a server made and operated by one of Hack Forum's very own members, making it a fun place to catch up with various users in the community.

Beblawi said it was not an easy decision to disperse the supporters of Morsi. The Egyptian government has officially declared a state of emergency, after 525 civilians have been reported killed; numbers continue to rise. Riot police, armored vehicles, helicopters and bulldozers have been used to sweep away two encampments of supporters of the ousted president Mohammed Morsi.  The assault to take control of the two sites came after much warning from the government that replaced Morsi, who was ousted on July 3rd.  Smoke smothered the skies above Cairo and fires scorched the streets around the sites. The United Nations, the European Union and several countries have denounced the use of force by the Egyptian government. Pandemonium struck among the thousands of protesters and there is still more to hear about the situation’s status.\n\n[color=white][b]Washington Post, CNN and Time Websites Attacked by Pro-Assad Hackers\n[/b][/color]Many links on the sites were redirecting readers to the website of the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA). The attacks have been blamed on a third-party link recommendation service that all three of the sites used. Attacks from the SEA have been occurring over the course of a few months on several media companies. Time spokesman Daniel Kile said that while the Outbrain-powered module on Time’s pages had been manipulated, the website itself had not been compromised. However one security expert described the hack as “dangerous”. The SEA also hacked the Facebook and Twitter accounts of the New York Post.  Several of the media companies attacked are reevaluating their website’s security, while others are saying that it could have been an internal issue.\n\n[color=white][b]Iran Parliament Approves New President’s Cabinet Nominees \n[/b][/color]Iran’s parliament has approved almost all of the cabinet nominees appointed by the newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani, on Thursday. This was done in an effort to mend the country’s economic crisis and end its international isolation. The lawmakers approved 15 of Mr. Rouhani’s 18 cabinet choices, rejecting candidates for the ministries of science, education and sport. Many of the cabinet members have served in governments that predate the eight year presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad, Rouhani’s predecessor. Rouhani said that he had picked “veteran commanders” because of the country’s difficult situation with inflation and economic stagnations. The new president says the economy will be his government’s priority.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Google is Now 40% of the Internet [/color][/b]\nThis week Google had a blackout that, surprisingly, caused 40% of website services to go dark, as well as a 50% bounce as they came back on with everyone attempting to catch up on what they were doing. What happened to knock Google out entirely isn't known as of yet. \n\n[spoiler=Here are a few rumors as to how Google was knocked off:]One is that someone typed “Google” into Google which, as everyone knows, will break the internet (this makes more sense if you watch UK TV). The other is that the GooglePlex finally achieved sentience yesterday afternoon. My favorite is that the the computers decided to join the Friday afternoon beer bash for the first time.[/spoiler]\n\nJokes aside, there are two impressive and fascinating numbers here. The first is that Google does seem to be, in all its manifestations and forms, 40% of all internet traffic. The other is that while going down in its entirety wasn’t a particularly great advertisement for the firm, bringing it all back up in only 11 minutes was. After all, screw ups and mistakes happen; it’s how quickly and effectively one cleans up afterwards that is the real test.\n\n[b][color=white]Google Blocks Microsoft's YouTube App for Windows Phone. Again.[/color][/b]\nEarlier this week, Microsoft released its new YouTube application for Windows Phone after it was disabled in May by YouTube for failing to display ads. Though the new app displays ads, the app was blocked again today by Google – apparently, because the app violates YouTube’s terms of service, even though the two companies collaborated on the app.\nIn a statement, Google said, \"We’re committed to providing users and creators with a great and consistent YouTube experience across devices, and we’ve been working with Microsoft to build a fully featured YouTube for Windows Phone app, based on HTML5. Unfortunately, Microsoft has not made the browser upgrades necessary to enable a fully-featured YouTube experience, and has instead re-released a YouTube app that violates our Terms of Service. It has been disabled. We value our broad developer community and therefore ask everyone to adhere to the same guidelines.\" \n\nFor the latter market of Windows Phone users, hopes are high that the app will return.\n\n[b][color=white]Are Encryption Keys Protected by the Fifth Amendment? [/color][/b]\nA man was arrested in Wisconsin this week in the latest move in a long-running battle by the authorities to force him to hand over decryption keys for hard drives believed to contain child pornography. The case illustrates the legal confusion in the US over whether encryption keys are effectively protected by the Fifth Amendment – the right to refuse to say something that might be self-incriminating. No such right exists in the UK. Even though invoking the 'the fifth' can be traced in origin back to the Magna Carta and is related to the British 'right to remain silent', that right as far as encryption is concerned was effectively revoked by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). This act is rarely used in the UK (although it carries its own gagging order); but one case involved a 19 year-old youth sentenced to four months imprisonment in 2010 for refusing to hand over a 50-character key. The current case in the US has revolved around FBI attempts to break the encryption on several hard disks seized from the suspect. One magistrate originally declined to order him to decrypt the drives, but subsequently changed the ruling. This was then suspended and a new briefing on the Fifth Amendment was scheduled. But just before the briefing was due to be held, the FBI this week arrested the suspect on two counts of of receiving or distributing child pornography, and one count of possessing child pornography.\n\nAt this point, however, the question of whether encryption keys are protected by the Fifth Amendment remains unknown. Though rare, decryption orders are likely to become more common as the public increasingly embraces technology that comes standard on most operating systems. Decryption orders have never squarely been addressed by the Supreme Court, despite conflicting opinions in the lower courts.

Sources describe the device as a wrist watch-like smartphone that allows you to make calls, use email and surf the web. Rumors have it that the device will be called the Galaxy Gear, the same name a recent Samsung patent filing pointed at. That patent outlined a digital electronic wearable in the form of a wristwatch, band or bangle with full internet and messaging capabilities. Samsung's wearable device will not have a flexible display, but according to the sources, the company is indeed still working on a watch prototype that does. It is unclear as to whether or not the Galaxy Gear is operating as a completely stand alone device or designed to access content and services through your smartphone or tablet. Some have suggested the first to market a proper smartwatch could really bolster platform adoption rates. With Sony unveiling its SmartWatch 2 already, and with Apple and Microsoft both appearing to be entering the wearable computing space in the near future, the race looks to have gotten even tighter.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Participate in a Mysterious Video Shoot[/b][/color]\nRihanna and A$AP were spotted while they were filming a new music video. The two were not alone either; A$AP Ferg and A$AP Illz were there too. This all took place Thursday, August 15th 2013. Rihanna has been known for changing her styles a lot, and for the outfit she wore, she had her new hair style. She dressed up a bit odd this time. She wore black jeans, a black jacket, as well as Timberlands. As of now, there's no information on what they were filming. MTV News wanted to be the first ones to get the information out of the two. This is not the first time the two have collaborated together. If you've been to one of Rihanna's tours, Rocky has even opened up for her Diamonds tour. When asked why he was working with her, he stated, \"She has a lot of style, and I think that's what she saw in me and what she liked, because she saw that I was eclectic with the way I did my music and my style was different,\" he said, later joking, \"I really think it was more she admired me as an artist — and the fact that I'm handsome helped.\" \n\n[color=white][b]Chris Brown Avoids Jail Time[/b][/color]\nChris Brown has recently been in court due to a hit-and-run incident that occurred back in May. The victim, Olga Gure-Kovalenko stated that Brown did not exchange insurance information with her when this happened. In the state of California (where the accident took place) this is considered an offense. According to TMZ, Chris was a total jerk toward Olga and called her a \"b*tch\" on the scene. Chris is still on probation when he assaulted Rihanna, so his rudeness towards Olga wasn't really looked at as deeply as she thought it would. The case was dismissed though since there wasn't really much damage to her car. Despite the fact that he was mean, he got away as not-guilty. Brown's lawyer tried to explain that he is actually a nice guy, and that you should look past his history.\n\n[color=white][b]Eminem's Surprise Single Increases Demand for More[/b][/color]\nIf you didn't catch the Call of Duty: Ghosts premiere on August 14th, then you probably missed the first showcase of Eminem's song. Don't fret, though, because you can have a listen below. His new album will be released soon, and it will probably be talked about for quite some time. He has many fans across the world and this song definitely had that kick-ass feeling everyone loves about Eminem's songs. In fact there has been an increase in the amounts of tickets being sold at the Reading and Leeds Festival in a few weeks which will take place during the last week of August. Not only did Eminem's song get showcased in the official multiplayer of CoD: Ghosts, he even made a video explaining the song which you can watch [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UL4XcsuQLE]here[/url]. As he said in the video, stay tuned for more.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA9w5rp3Y4[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nSometimes you have to close one door to open another. During this past week, I ended up leaving my long-time position as a Reviewer and taking my chances upon a new group. Personally, none of the groups gave me any interest but one: Fly By Night. After an application and a few messages with members and leaders, I made it into this new family and have been giddy ever since. While within the Reviewers, I had always viewed the group from a pained perspective and as a workload, yet with Fly By Night, I am excited to see what has happened throughout my meager night's sleep. The Reviewers was the group that I thought I'd never leave, but it was the group I needed to leave. So, when life points you in a direction... follow it.",
