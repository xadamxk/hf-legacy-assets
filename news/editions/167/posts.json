There was no announcement or Twitter status about the change, but it can be assumed that until [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] finds something he decides is worth it in the long run, the text will stay in place. For now, enjoy the simplistic yet to-the-point look of this change in addition to the ever so slightly faster loading times for those who don't keep a browser cache. The change can be seen by using the Modern theme from the options in the User CP. \n\n[color=white][b]Sticky Change: Five Wasn't Enough, So How About Six? [/b][/color]\nFollowing both a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3844588]thread announcement[/url] and a [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/397159177853759488]twitter status update[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] has changed the maximum amount of stickies allowed per section from five (5) to six (6), excluding the SST which remains at eight (8). Feeling that he had raised the prices enough, this change should assist in alleviating the pressure on the sticky positions and allow sellers a better chance to display their threads in their preferred sections.\n\n[color=white][b]Webmasters: New Material[/b][/color]\nIn a [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/393972245179015168]tweet[/url] made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url], he announces changes to the Webmaster tab of the forums. The most prominent change is the addition of a brand new \"[url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=295]Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla[/url]\" section under the already existing \"[url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=50]Website Construction[/url] forum. For those who know these topics by heart, you are now free to contribute your knowledge to others by visiting the section. Those who know little or even nothing about them, now is your chance to expand your existing knowledge on the subjects.

Today we're interviewing Arcaina. How are you doin' man? Anyone you'd like to give shoutouts to?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] I am doing well and am excited to be interviewed. I would like to give a shout out to Tibit, Daisy and for being the truest real niggaz I know.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Real niggaz forreal. So, how'd you find HF? I remember when you had the alias Eternal ages ago, and now it's Arcaina. Is there any certain meaning to 'Arcaina'?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] I found Hack Forums when I first got my Droid X2. I was trying to learn whatever I could about it and did a Google search for rooting and found Hack Forums. Decided to stay because the site was very interesting, was my first forum experience. Mainly hung out in the Anime section at first then moved on to other things. \n\nArcaina was the name I signed up with and was a nickname from when I was a kid pronounce Ar-Cain-A. The name was given to my Yin, or negative side. I gave the name to myself.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Very interesting. So, it's safe to say that you're in love with Android? I'm sure that you've seen some of the additions to the new and updated theme. What are your thoughts on it?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes I am very much in love with Android. As far as the theme goes I am loving the change, it is stunning in my opinion. I spoke briefly with Omniscient about the new theme seeing if he would do work designing themes, that is what I think of it. He is a great designer, at least when it comes to Hack Forums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Speaking the truth! So, what made you venture to other sections of the forum as a newbie? When I first joined, I mainly stuck to one section. Very adventurous. (I know)\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] I was interested in talking to people, posting random things and different topics such as music, computing etc. I became L337 within a week of joining and posted a lot in the lounge because it was entertaining, asked questions in computing areas depending on devices and was interested in web design so I started posting there as well. Now I mainly post in groups and in the lounge.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Who doesn't? I became L33T fairly fast after joining the site, too. What are your other hobbies outside of the site? Gaming, perhaps?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] Gaming is one of them, been playing HackerCraft with Brotherhood for a week or so now, huge Bethesda fan as well. Prefer RTS games and RPGs over any. Other than that I like writing, socializing, playing pool, drinking (Yes, it's a hobby) and watching shows like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. If I am not doing those, or on HF I am spending time with my girlfriend or cat. Or both lol.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]True! How are you liking HackerCraft? Realized that you've purchased the HC award too. Nice!\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] I am very much enjoying it to my surprise, still learning the game as I literally just started playing like two weeks ago. I am thinking about starting up a server with a few people interested, as well as having someone code a client for us.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Really? Woah, I remember playing MineCraft for the first time.. Nostalgia. Do you have any real life goals that you're shooting for right now?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] I want to start a non-profit organization to help people who are depressed/suicidal and have other varying mental illnesses. I will go back to school for psychology first before I will do any concrete work for this.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Psychology was a really interesting course. Took it last year. What about online or here at the forums? Any future plans?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina[/url]:[/b][/color] To continue leadership in The Empire and keep those noobs in check and on the right track. Have some interesting new developments in the group and some new products on the way. Other than that working within 143 and on the forum to help people. Other than that I will be more active in the Health Wise section and Innuendo giving advice on psychological and sexual based questions, perhaps a help thread like we used to do. May start selling a few things in the future outside of the groups, but that depends on a few factors.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Looking forward to them! Glad you're planning to stay active. Since, you've been around for a while -- what are your thoughts on the News Team? Anything you'd like us to change?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina [/url]:[/b][/color] I love the news team, have applied a few times for The Writers, once for news and twice for the Wiki but was denied unfortunately. Will continue applying though. Nothing I can think of to change it, except maybe a collaboration with the FBN radio section sometimes.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad to hear that you appreciate our work. Any closing statements?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Arcaina [/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, to those of you who need emotional help feel free to contact me.\n\nFor those of you who are depressed, suicidal or ill in other forms know that everything can get better with time. Program yourself not to think negatively. Control your triggers.\n\nAlso for all you fake niggaz out there who brag about owning mega corporations and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cars, why don't you try being yourself? You never know, people may like you.\n\nOmniscient, great work on the Theme. \n\nTibit, xadamxk and mad you are noobs. \n\nThanks for the interview Clique, its been real.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=uid=874137]Computer Professor[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome everyone! Today we're interviewing the member Computer Professor. Do you have any shoutouts you'd like to give before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I would love to make a shout out to everyone I trust in the Computer Overclocking, Customizing, and Hardware, phybeя, Cloud, and Shutdown (Daisy).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So why don't you tell us what brought you over to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I was a looking for hacks/mods back in 2009, and I kept finding this website. I thought it was a virus then so I never join. Two years later I realized that I can't get a virus on a site. So I joined, and started to learn to deface. I quickly stop, and move to the Computer Overclocking, Customizing, and Hardware section because I own over 50 computers at the time and love repairing/building them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] 50 Computers at the time? Wow, you're a bit of an enthusiast. Do you work in the IT field?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I work with my local school district and my uncle's repair shop. Both keep me really busy, and help me expand my knowledge. At the school I learn about networking, and have complete control of the computer labs. I can upgrade them if I want, and I am upgrading some 9 year old computers. My budget is $9,000 in the school. I already spent $800 of it on upgrades. I learn about networking and other stuff like that too. To many to list. At my uncle's repair shop I only repair and build computers. The only reason why I got the job at the school is because of my knowledge, but I only work for 90 min because I had to take a class for it. Which I am the only student taking the class.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url]That's a pretty sweet gig. So when did you get into building computers?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Back when I was 12 or 13 I built my first real computer, and I still use it as a server. The Specs are an AMD Athlon x2 4400+, MSI K9AGM2-L, 500gb Seagate, and Pny Nvidia Geforce 9800 gx2. The rest of the specs I forgot what they were, but I have built 6 computers for myself.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] It's nice to see you helping others out with their builds too. So is there anything you'd like to see done differently on Hack Forums? It can be In regards to anything from the community or specific site rules.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Only a few. I would like to see Omniscient start posting in different sections. Secondly I would like to see some improvements in the Computer Overclocking, Customizing, and Hardware for people having flaming wars about parts and other things.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] It would be cool to see Omni around more. Sadly with every section there'a going to be flame wars. I see your point though. Speaking of Hack Forums changes; How do you feel about all of the recent theme switches? which theme do you currently use and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I use the old school theme because I greatly dislike the windows 8/tablet look. The new theme gives me a headache, and I greatly dislike the color scheme. That is all I have to say about that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Sorry to hear that. Well the old theme's always an option. So how did you get the idea to start that custom pc thread which helped members find the right parts for their specific builds/budgets?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I use to be like everyone else and help people in a thread, but I realized I had to debate with members about what parts to use. So after two people built my build and posted proof. I created the first thread, and it failed. So I recreated it, and again failed. But I learned from my mistakes and recreated it (Kind of the same thing omni did.) That time it took off. I never thought I would get more then 500 post, but we got around 1,700 posts before I closed it. Right now it has 3.5 times more post then the 2nd top thread in that section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Wow that's impressive. I'm assuming you closed it due to the overwhelm response it got?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url]Not really. The main reason is that I am going to be inactive soon. I will be on once in a while, but not enough to keep it alive. I had 4 pages of requests, because of how busy I was with other stuff. Lastly it is time for someone else to carry the name.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I see. Would you mind telling a little more about why you'll be leaving Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I am not leaving Hack Forums. I will be on it when I can. I have 2 jobs, and school. I barely have time for HF anymore. I would love to spend more time with my family, and my Girl. I will get on Hack Forums when I can.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Carson Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Ahh I see. Well I wish you the best of luck with everything. Thanks for taking time out of your day to be interviewed. Are there any final thoughts you'd like to leave everybody with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do. Remember that AMD has that flower power, and has more cores. That is a sign of my fanboy side. I will miss everyone of you; including Aesthetics.\n[/spoiler]",

It was announced during Minecon, an annual event dedicated to Minecraft. Users can broadcast gameplay to their Twitch channel from a click of a button, however Mojang has not announced a release date for this feature. Twitch streaming support will only be available on Windows and Mac versions of the game. \"Expect a watershed moment for both players and spectators once the ability to easily broadcast gameplay directly to Twitch goes live,\" Twitch marketing VP Matthew DiPietro said. In addition, Xbox One gamers can stream Minecraft directly to Twitch due to earlier partnership announcements with Microsoft.\n\n[color=white][b]Bungie talks Destiny: Competitive Multiplayer[/b][/color]\nDestiny is an upcoming title which will be available for current and next-generation consoles. Bungie has stated that competitive multiplayer in the game is a huge focus for the team, however no detailed information about this was released. \"Competitive multiplayer is a huge focus for the team. We love it. We play it at lunch weekly. We fight about it. We constantly go back and forth. The perspectives vary wildly inside the studio,\" Osborne said. \"But it's already got to the point where it's really fun and it's really about tweaking and iterating and playing it every day and finding that spot we think is unique but also feels familiar for those who are into competitive multiplayer that's skill-based, 'I'm better than you not necessarily because of the gear I have but because I'm better than you.'\" It was not revealed how players can access the multiplayer component, however Osborne said that you cannot force players you meet in the open world into a PvP match. Bungie has a lot of experience with competitive multiplayer, so it is safe to say that it should be a fun, competitive experience. Destiny drops in 2014, with beta access early in the year.\n\n[color=white][b]Ubisoft Drops Online Passes[/b][/color]\nUbisoft has announced they are dropping online passes for all future games. \"The Uplay Passport program was initiated as a means of giving customers full access and support for online multiplayer and features, along with exclusive content, bonuses, and rewards,\" Ubisoft said in a statement. \"However, games today are blurring the line between offline and online, between what is 'single-player' and what is 'multiplayer,'\" the statement continues. \"Based on that and on the feedback we received from you, we recognized that Passport is no longer the best approach for ensuring that all our customers have the best possible experience with all facets of our games.\" However, the online pass for Assassins Creed: Black Flag will be available for free from Xbox LIVE or the Playstation Network. If you already purchased an online pass for this game, you can contact the Ubisoft support team in your region. Earlier this year, EA announced they are dropping online passes; the community wins again.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThe official Call of Duty Live-Action Trailer... featuring Megan Fox and four buddies.\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCMKRfyvUeE[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]2013 Minecon Capes Are Out![/color][/b]\nAs the tradition of the festival continues, so does its tradition of giving a cape to those that attend it. In the first event, users had to submit their Minecraft usernames and the cape would then be put on the account, however in 2012, a code was sent to the user's email and could be redeemed by anyone. That being said, this year is similar to that of 2012 and likely many people will be selling them. The appearance of this year's cape is represented by a piston on a green background, but it fits in very similar with the preceding years and is viewable in the spoiler below.\n\n[spoiler=2013 Cape][img]http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/c/c0/Minecon_2013_cape.png[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]Minecon Has Arrived![/color][/b]\nAs the title suggests, the event has arrived! Taking place during November 2nd and 3rd, Mojang is expecting 2,500 of its dearest fans at the event in Orlando, FL. In addition to the developers that will be present, many well-known Youtubers will be too. Autographs will be signed, merchandise will be bought, pictures will be taken, and an overall fun time will definitely be had. Even if they're not going, users can tune in to watch a livestream of the event on [url=http://www.youtube.com/teammojang]Mojang's Youtube channel[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft to Support Twitch[/color][/b]\nAfter an announcement at Minecon, Mojang developers had stated that they'd be putting an end to the necessity of third-party recording software/hardware to stream Minecraft. With such an announcement, developers had stated that a partnership has been made with Twitch.tv and that integration of the software will be implemented in the future. All though there's no confirmed release date, at that, it has definitely been confirmed and users on PC and Mac will be sure to see the update.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nThe third edition of HackerCraft's news will be made available in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=252]HackerCraft section[/url].

According to the leaked documents, data is passed between data centers in plain text and provides hundreds of millions of new records to the government. This news is surprising after previous leaks reveled the existence of an NSA program called PRISM which already compels Google and many other companies to hand over these records. This program, named MUSCULAR, also involves the United Kingdom's own intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), assistance to gather and process the stolen information.\n\n[color=white][b]Congress Members Failed to Show to Drone Victims Talk[/b][/color]\nOnly 5 members of the United States Congress showed up to a discussion about the effects drone attacks have on the lives of Pakistani citizens. Representative Alan Grayson (D-FL) organized the hearing and invited Pakistani school teacher Rafiq ur Rehman and his two children to discuss how their lives were after Rehman's mother was killed in a US drone strike. Zubair Rehman told the few attendees, “I no longer love blue skies. In fact, I now prefer grey skies. The drones do not fly when the skies are grey” (via [url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/19751-drone-strike-victims-tell-their-story-but-is-america-listening][i]Truth Out[/i][/url]). Attending representatives included Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D- IL), Rush Holt (D-NJ), John Conyers (D-MI), Rick Nolan (D-MN), and Alan Grayson (D-FL).\n\n[color=white][b]Edward Snowden Wants to Testify in Exchange for German Amnesty[/b][/color]\nAfter a week of outrage from German citizens over the recent revelation of US spying on Chancellor Angela Merkel, Edward Snowden sent a letter to German officials proposing to testify about US spying activities in exchange for political amnesty. This move has put Merkel into an uncomfortable position. While anger with American spying is high throughout Germany, the government is still subject to an extradition treaty signed with the United States and would be expected to return Snowden to America.  As of this writing no decision has been made by the German government. Edward Snowden's asylum in Russia is temporary and will expire a year after it was granted.\n\n[color=white][b]Shooting in LAX Airport Kills One TSA Agent and Wounds Two Others[/b][/color]\n23 year old white male Paul Ciancia shot his way through an LAX security checkpoint killing one TSA agent and injuring two others. The shooter began firing immediately upon entering the airport, before ever reaching a security checkpoint. A note was found in his bag indicating his desire to kill TSA agents. This attack comes soon after the agency expanded its PreCheck program, which would allow pre-screened passengers to move through security checkpoints more quickly, though there is no indication the attack was because of this move.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Airlines Allowing Devices Access At All Times[/b][/color]\nJetBlue and Delta are now allowing devices use during takeoff and landing, as well as most other stages of a flight. This news comes just hours after the FAA approved the use of devices access during all times of any flight. These two are the first to use these new relaxed rules, while other airlines are applying for it now. Many speculate that it won't be long until people will be able to do this on all flights. There is no telling when other airlines will allow this.\n\n[color=white][b]Android 81% Of The Smartphone Market In Q3[/b][/color]\nIt was estimated that in Q3, Android phones were dominating the market. According to estimates, Android phones hold 81% of the market in Q3. This is up 6% from last year at this time when it was at 75%. Android seems to be taking over, and that won’t stop any time soon. This also comes with the news that Apple phones are down 2.2% from last year's 15.6%.\n\n[color=white][b]Apple iPad Air Now Available In 42 Countries[/b][/color]\nWith the recent announcement of the iPad Air, everyone has been eagerly awaiting the release of the device. The wait is over for most, being that the device is now available in 42 different countries. You can acquire the iPad through Apple's website, or visit your local Apple store.  There is no word yet on when it will be available in other countries.\n\n[color=white][b]Time Warner Cable To Offer Faster Internet To Get Customers Back[/b][/color]\nTime Warner Cable is now offering to give faster internet to customers in light of the recent CBS drama that caused many to leave.

Perry can also boast 2013's best-selling week for a female solo artist, beating out the first frame of Miley Cyrus' Bangerz (270,000). Katy easily bested the week's other debuts (in fact she sold more than #2-9 combined), including Fifth Harmony's Better Together EP (#6, 28,000), DJ Khaled's Suffering From Success (#7, 27,000) and AFI's Burials (#9, 25,000). Over on the iTunes album chart, pre-sales for One Direction's Midnight Memories had the #2 slot locked down. On other news, the rest of the top 10 featured a shuffling of the deck from some recent chart toppers. Last week's #1 from Pearl Jam, Lightning Bolt, dropped 72 percent to #2 (46,000) and Cyrus was down two spots to #4 (43,000). Drake's Nothing Was The Same inched up a slot to #3 (44,000), putting him at more than 991,000, assuring platinum status by next week's chart.\n\n[b][color=white]Eminem: \"Can't Get Mad\" At Kendrick and Why He Went Back to Blonde.[/color][/b]\nIn a recent interview Em has stated (about Kendrick Lamar), \"He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the 'Control' verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that sh-- he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking.\" When asked about going back to blonde he mentioned, \"Um, I'll say that one was [manager Paul Rosenberg's] idea. In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it... So I just tried it. And I was like 'Fuck it.'\" Check out Em's newest record, \"Marshall Mathers LP 2\", out now.\n\n[color=white][b]Kanye West Postpones [i]Yeezus[/i] Tour[/b][/color]\nKanye West was forced to postpone a Vancouver date during the first week of his Yeezus Tour — possibly due to complications with the intricate stage setup — and now an accident that resulted in damaged tour gear will cause a few additional delays. The Yeezus Tour kicked off in Seattle on October19 and has continued through cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, but the upcoming tour dates for Vancouver, Denver and Minneapolis will now be postponed. According to a statement from Def Jam Records, a truck carrying a custom-made video truss and 60-ft circular LED screen for the tour was in an accident en route to Vancouver on Wednesday (October 30). The gear was damaged beyond repair and will have to be replaced before the show carries on. Kanye also recently talked about the controversial Jesus appearance, stating \"I had a friend of mine who's a pastor there as we started discussing how we want to deliver it,\" he said. \"My girl even asked afterwards, 'Hmm, is that weird if Jesus comes on stage?' No, we do plays all the time. People play Jesus. You know what's awesome about Christianity is we're allowed to portray God? We're allowed to draw image of him, we're allowed to make movies about him. Other religions you're not allowed to do that. That's what's really awesome about Christianity. That's one of the awesome things.\" \n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoIpx1ZxFeM[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nProcrastination. Oh gawd it's bad. Sometimes you need to just buckle down and get shit done. Rather than pushing things off until the last minute as per usual, attempt to start them earlier on and spread out the effort. You'll always push it off if you don't resolutely decide when to begin. Then, if you keep said resolution, your productivity will rise and your lifestyle will improve.",
