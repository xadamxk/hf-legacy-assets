This proposed requirement would prohibit international companies that produce smartphone chips to first acquire a license to use \"American chip making equipment\" before selling any chips to Huawei. This restriction is intended to avoid the selling of specialized chips to major telecommunications companies in China and to supply more common chips. Trump hasn't signed off on any new regulations yet, but if he does, tech companies like Apple and Qualcomm could lose out.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnet.com/news/us-officials-reportedly-agree-to-cut-off-huawei-from-global-chip-suppliers/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Amazon’s Alexa To Help Diagnose – COVID-19[/color][/b]\r\nUsers of Alexa in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, the UK, and the US can now ask their device for the first steps of diagnosing COVID-19.
