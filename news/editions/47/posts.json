To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=162]here[/url].\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNHeadlines.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\nThis week a new feature was implemented by our administrator [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]. In your [URL=http://hackforums.net/usercp.php]User CP[/URL], you now have an IP log in log. This should reduce the amount of users asking staff if a strange IP has accessed their account.\r\n\nThis week administrator [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] implemented a new lounge rule making it the eighth rule. The rule is “8. No misleading thread titles or titles inferring adult content.” Read about the rule [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1403747]here[/url].\r\n\nAdministrator [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made an announcement to all hackers who try to bring him or any of his sites down. Read it [URL=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1400120]here[/URL].\r\n\nOn June 17th, 2011, HF experienced some downtime. Like always, administrator [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] had HF back up and running quickly and promptly. \r\n\nThe word Lulz-sеc has been filtered. The filter now changes the word to simply [censored].\r\n\nStaff member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][color=lime][b]xerotic[/b][/color][/url] has returned from vacation at Disneyland and is back to managing reports and giving out warnings, so rule breakers beware!\r\n\nEven with all of the troubles administrator [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has had dealing with member controlled user groups, two new ones have been created this week—Reverence and The Informers. Reverence is owned by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=657392] [color=white][b] Astonish is NJ [/b][/color][/url]. The Informers is controlled by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=616850][b] [color=#0066FF]Atthackers[/color][/b][/url].  Both of these users have been very generous in donating large sums of money for their official groups, which are sure to be quite a hit around the HF community. We hope to hear more from them soon.\r\n\nThis week a suggestion by user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712][color=white][b]Cobalt+[/b][/color][/url] has been accepted. Now in order for a thread to become “Hot” it must have 100 replies or 1000 views or more.\r\n\nMember [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848][color=#AAAAFF][b]Qwazz[/b][/color][/url] has stepped down from the leader position of the RATs crew. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=579898][b]KillαMuvz[/b][/url] has been promoted to take his place. His first action as leader has been to reopen recruiting, if you would like to apply click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1406024]here[/url].\r\n\nThe RATs crew’s subsection description has been changed. It now reads, “This is The RATS Crew, we do RAT related things.”.\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNUsernews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=365039][color=#0066bf][b]Lucid[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=63387][color=#0066bf][b]Black Shadow[/b][/color][/url] have both received the esteemed Qwazz Star award.

He died Monday morning. He was speculated to be very drunk. It was also thought that he was going an upwards of 130 miles per hour. This only goes to show that drinking and driving never mix. R.I.P Ryan Dunn, we’ll miss you.\r\n\nAs Lulz-sec is hitting harder and harder at sites, so are the authorities at them. Ryan Cleary has been arrested for possible connections and leading of the group. He was caught via an FBI sting operation. This proves the FBI actually has the ability to integrate their way into just about hacking community, and expose it. Lulz-sec claimed he is, at best, a mild connection to the group. Beware, Lulz-sec, the end may soon be here.\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNInterviews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 1 - Xch4ng3[/color][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler][color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Hello, Xch4ng3. Thank you for allowing me to interview you. First thing I would like to ask, what brought you to HackForums?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I was on a quest to hack to exploit MSN, followed links through did a lot of searching and end up registering on HF.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] When you first joined, what did you think of the forum?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I used to think it was a secret forum which hardly anyone knew about - considering how much of this information was new to me I was surprised no one else knew of it. It wasn't as active when I first joined, but it allowed me to get to know the members more than now.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, I see that you have no user name changes. How did you choose the name 'Xch4ng3'?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] Funny story really. I was on my way home and I was thinking of usernames. I wanted something which no one else would have and which would ring a bell. It deviates from a show that I used to watch on TV when I was a kid called Short Change and I just kept on running through names until I reached Xchange and then added the numbers.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] I have never seen that show! You are the only Staff with only one award (Ub3r Saphire) and in no groups. Do you want to have more awards or be in groups, or have you ever wanted those in the past?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I used to co-run DSinc, now known as Techsperts. I'm not really fussed about the awards if I'm honest. If I get them, it's just a bonus.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] What made you step-down or leave DS Inc?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I left HF for about a month during that time I left HF and handed the group over to the other co-leaders. We were a bit inactive so I had no interest in reviving it.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] You were also staff some time back. Why did you step down, and how did you regain your position?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I left because of personal reasons. I simply didn't have time to be staff and I didn't want to stay on the team if I couldn't help. When I returned, I asked if there was still a place on the team for me, turns out it there was.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] How have your experience's been with staff, then and now?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] It's been really interesting. If this was a real job, it would be a pretty fun one. I learn something new every day and every day is different. \r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Being staff, you can see all the forum areas. Do you gravitate towards a certain one? Which is your favorite, and why?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I don't really stick to one area, but the currency exchange forum is a place I stick to a lot.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, now on to questions focused on your interests! Which do you prefer, Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] Haha, memories. Yu-Gi-Oh because I was a huge fan of the card game.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] If you have to choose any age to be right now, what age would you choose?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I would go back to being 14 again; it was a time when I didn't have to worry about anything.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Does you being staff on a hacking forum affect your personal life?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] Not really, I have set times for both online and personal activities. So each is separate.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, I am going to wrap up this interview with some questions about the current events of HF.\r\nWhat do you think about the two user groups being purchased?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I think they both have their good bits and bad. I can't really comment much on this to be honest.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Summertime in the northern hemisphere is just hitting. What do you think the activity will be like?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] I think we’re going to see a lot more people signing up and posting on HF. It's going to be an eventful summer for me, balancing having fun with friends and family and work, but I always enjoy a challenge.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Well, thank you for the interview! Do you have a shoutout or any words you would like to say?\r\n[color=lime][b]Xch4ng3:[/b][/color] Thanks to everyone who helps make my job on HF a lot easier, especially those who send a PM thanking me now and then really helps during long nights.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, this was an interview of HF Staff member Xch4ng3.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNClassifieds.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[align=left][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1158830][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/Attbooter.png[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n[align=right][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1277828][IMG]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy322/valik140795/LAL-1.gif[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n[align=left][url=http://www.mskeys.in][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/X3GG1.jpg[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNTeam.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[color=white][b]Publisher & Head Writer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848]Qwazz[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Publishers Assistant[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033]xerotic[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Writers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712]Cobalt[/url] - Other News/Headlines\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=153686]Fireren[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url] - User News\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Reporters[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=129444]3x0r_$c0rPi0n[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=126243]Decoy[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453]ReactioNz[/url] - Head Reporter\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=168826]Tyler777[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=200751]Zach[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=115612]-BoodyE-[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=137080]Boxing[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=92059]Security™[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Editor[/b] [/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=70881]Paradoxum[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Graphic Designer[/b][/color] \r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671]panDa.[/url]\r\n[/list]",
