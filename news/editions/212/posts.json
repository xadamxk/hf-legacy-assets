The award certainly does give off a royal vibe and is listed with a description of: [i]\"You deserve the royal treatment for your honorable position on HF.\"[/i] No one has received the award yet so for now we will all just have to sit back and wait and see who's going to be the first royalty. http://hackforums.net/myawards.php\r\n\n[color=white][b]Dishes and Ranting[/b][/color]\r\nOn October 30th, 2014 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made a rant video while doing the dishes. Throughout the video [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] talked about things from how teens are lazy when it comes to dishes, (which is true for the most part) to talking about trying to find time to add new features he has already fully written. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also talked about the busy times of the year for him and how he now knows what needs to be done by what time. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] ended the video with stating that that in the next month he is going to be working on tools for account security and easier marketplace navigation.

Welcome to 212th edition of the HF News, today we're here with Soxy. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to shout out my friend Garrett, my boyfriend Cody of 143, my m9 HOUstoner, and monica Sudsy!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Quite an interesting mix, how do you know these clowns? Especially that Sudsy kid, heard he has an ugly cat and is the self-proclaimed fresh prince of BitCoin.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I met Garrett a while ago while playing on HackerCraft with my boyfriend Cody of 143. HOUstoner and I run a minecraft server together with our friend Lingo, and for Sudsy, we've known each other for a few years. We met during MW2 when we were boosting together!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I feel somewhat bad for you, but onto the next question. How did you come across Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] Well as you know I am a pretty big hacker. It all started about 2 years ago when I searched google how to hack stuff and I came across this forum.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] We're you searching for anything specifically? Have you finally reached the rank of master hacker?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I was not looking for anything specifically, I just stumbled upon this website. Yes, I would consider myself a master hacker as well as everyone else that is registered on this website.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I hear you have a Minecraft server, how's that going?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do have a minecraft server. I run it with HOUstoner and Lingo, both are members of this website. The server has been great. The player base has been growing like crazy. A ton of new features have been added to the server in the past few weeks. Our players seem to really enjoy it.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So I heard you make some custom plugins, is that a hobby or do you want to make a career out of coding?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I would never consider making a career out of it, I just find it fun to do. I've tried hiring developers but when I want something done I want it done right then and there, not a week later. So I decided to start learning Java. I've made maybe 5 or so plugins and edited about 10 public ones that we use to change certain things I didn't like about them or add new features. I am definitely not an experienced coder but I know enough to get the job done!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So how do you feel about Hacker Craft returning?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I'm pretty happy it's returning but I don't think it's going to be much fun. I probably won't be playing on it myself but I know a few people who will be.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Anything specific that makes you not want to play? If not can let's reminisce on the good old days in the 666 faction.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I don't believe there is going to be a farming economy anymore, which changes the entire way money is made on the server. The 666 faction was by far the biggest and best faction on Hackercraft before it was shut down earlier this year, if the server picked up where it left off months ago then I would definitely play again!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I was there for the award, I might try it, but don't plan on going as hard as the first server. So 5 hours until Advanced Warfare, how excited are you?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I know most people don't like Call of Duty, but it's always been fun for me, especially when a new one gets released. Currently me and my boyfriend Cody of 143 are patiently waiting for the midnight release so we can play it all night!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Are there any other titles you're looking forward to other than advanced warfare?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I am not interested in many of the games that are being released anytime soon other than LittleBigPlanet 3 which I will be getting for PS4. I usually just stick to Minecraft or Counter-Strike.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Trying to make the CSGO switch, it's so rough. So if you could change one thing about the site what would it be?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] I've been here long enough to know that people scam and eventually go rogue. This happened to one of my friends for his CSGO knife, it really made me mad. I wish that there was more action taken with on site scammers. It really bugs me that these members freely roam and making a scam report only puts a small mark on their profile.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree with you. I think that's all the time we have for this interview, do you have any final remarks you'd like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1583274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soxy:[/b][/color][/url] Cody is gay.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297]Barneyyz™[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 212th edition of the HF news, today we're here with Barneyyz™. What's up man?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] Not much buddy, it’s great to be interviewed. How are you doing, Justin?\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm great, thanks for asking. Any shoutouts you'd like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] Warbeast, an old friend of mine from Graphic Masters, as well as Rhythm and Rocketscience.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Nice, those are some older groups huh? How were groups back in the day compared to now?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] Yea, back in the day when groups weren’t costing $8,000 and the leaders cared about the groups over the money, it was absolutely great. There was barely any buy-ins, it was all down to the member to be invited or apply. Of course, not all groups are like that, but there is considerably more than there was back then. Really miss those days, met some brilliant members back in the day. A few of which I still talk to.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Seems like a lot of people would agree with that. What do you think is the best group, past or present?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I’ve been in a fair few during my stay here at HackForums, but my favorite group to be in would have to be Graphic Masters. Back when it was led by Buzz and Rhythm and on the odd occasion iBruteForce would appear. It was a really great group; the members were mostly active, great designers and I was happy that I could be a part of that.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Are you a graphic designer? Or did that interest fade away?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to say I’m still a graphic designer, and I still say to this day that I prefer traditional art. There’s nothing more relaxing for me than picking up a pencil and a piece of paper and drawing for an hour or two. I still use Photoshop regularly right enough, but not as much as before. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost my touch, though.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I was never any good at art, but it's good that you keep at it. I see that you were once in the Writers, how did you enjoy that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] I really enjoyed being in The Writ3rs, and I’ve been a member a couple of times over the last two years. One thing I remember is that it was always really active and I had some great friends there. It was back when I was more active here on HF and I really enjoyed doing the graphics and the occasional interview for the HF News. Had a terrific time in The Writ3rs, I’ve actually recently re-applied.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url]Who knows, maybe you'll be in it again! Do you like the changes to the news format so far?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] I really do, I love the sections that have been added since the last time I was in the group. I really enjoy the idea of the Site News, it shows how much we are actually progressing as a community in terms of members and threads, but not to mention the Hacking News, it also has some interesting stories in it which are always a good read.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I like the new design as well, especially the podcasts. So how did you end up finding HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] I actually joined HF in search of tutorials on password cracking and brute forcing. I was really interested in Minecraft and Porn accounts to sell, which was back in the day when you could sell porn accounts and before Minecraft accounts were banned. That was back in the start of 2011, but later in that yea and after learning quite a lot from HF members and tutorials I was directed too, I wrote a cracking tutorial on how to jack Minecraft accounts, which of course became pretty popular, but sadly it was junked when  discussion of Minecraft account cracking was banned, it’s good to see that it’s back though.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah I heard Omni is reviving HackerCraft. Will you be a part of that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] I heard about that actually, and I think it’s a great idea. I never really had a chance to play on the old Hacker Craft server, and would love for it to come around a second time so I can get back in to playing Minecraft with some members here on HF.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I never got into Minecraft, and I don't see it happening anytime soon either. What do you do outside of HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] Outside HF I’m an apprentice wind turbine technician. I’ve studied mechanical engineering since leaving school 3 years ago and in September last year, I was accepted in to an 18 month course which when I finish in January, I’ll have my work shop and theory qualifications as well as my working at heights ticket. I’ve always wanted to become and engineer, and it was only the last two years that I wanted to get in to renewable energy, and I’m really enjoying it.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome, I love the energy industry! Looks like you have your future set, huh?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] Well here’s hoping, only time will tell. With the company I’m working with at the moment they’ve made our group pretty well known to other companies, so it seems that we’re pretty well connected within the industry. So it seems to put us in a better position than others which should make jobs a little easier to get.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Looks like you're in good hands. Do you have any advice for the fledgling engineers of HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] If any HF members were looking to get in to engineering, I’d largely suggest renewables. It’s a quickly growing industry, and will always be around growing larger as time goes on. You need have pretty good mathematical skills as well as physics and problem solving skills, but it’s been great fun learning about both Mechanical and Electrical engineering, and would strongly recommend it.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Wise words, I'm actually looking to specialize in something related to that as well. Any closing remarks you'd like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=687297][color=white][b]Barneyyz™:[/b][/color][/url] I’d like to thank you again for interviewing me Justin, it’s been a pleasure and again, shout out to my homies, I hope you all have a great day.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

Omnibazaar will not be allowed to use the brand Omnicoin for a cryptocurrency and he's going to be filing with USPTO to remove the live mark and consider additional legal action if it's required. While Omnibazaar applied the real Omnicoin was already launched and being used. A simple Google search at that time would have pulled up our results. He can and will easily prove first use.[/quote]\n\nWhile this is not over yet, Omnicoin is going strong, and only getting stronger. \n\n[color=white][b]Weekly Highlights[/b][/color]\n[list][*][b][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4511469]WTF another OMC ?[/url][/b] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=31516]lobo13[/url]\n[*][b][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4509272]Omnicoin iOS app [Update Thread][/url][/b] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1931708]Programming[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]New OMC Exclusives[/b][/color]\n\n[list]\n[*][b][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4512062]Orway Crypter | Botkill Advanced | AntiBotkill | AvKiller | Tryvance | Startup Hidden[/url][/b]\n[/list]\n\n[size=small]Click [b][url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=314]here[/url][/b] to start your shop for a chance to be featured in the next edition.[/size]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/P95vWUx.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Site Statistics[/b][/color]\n\n[list][*][sp=[b]Total[/b]]\n[list][*][u]Posts:[/u] 43,117,309 ( [color=#32CD32]+31.88%[/color] )\n[*][u]Threads:[/u] 3,091,560 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.28%[/color] )\n[*][u]Members:[/u] 2,475,161 ( [color=#32CD32]+430.44%[/color] )[/list]\n\n[size=x-small][i]These dramatic increases are due to a new counting system implemented by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] and do not accurately represent the growth of the forum in the past week.[/i][/size][/sp][/list]\n\n[list][*][sp=[b]Average[/b]]\n[list][*][u]Daily Posts:[/u] 13,904 ( [color=#32CD32]+31.64%[/color] )\n[*][u]Daily Threads:[/u] 997 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.20%[/color] )\n[*][u]Daily New Members:[/u] 798 ( [color=#32CD32]+432.00%[/color] )\n[*][u]Posts Per Member:[/u] 17 ( [color=#FF0000]-75.11%[/color] )\n[*][u]Replies Per Thread:[/u] 13 ( [color=#32CD32]+43.89%[/color] )[/list]\n\n[size=x-small][i]These dramatic changes are due to a new counting system implemented by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] and do not accurately represent the growth of the forum in the past week.[/i][/size][/sp][/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Ban Statistics[/color][/b]\n\n[list][*][sp=[b]Last Week's Bans[/b]]\n[list][*][u]Staff Bans:[/u] 88\n[list][*][i]...

This was the biggest case of criminal hacking in Denmark's history. Over a period of 6 months, Warg had breached CSC servers and had illegally obtained access to over 10,000 emails belonging to European policemen. He also stole several million social security numbers of Danish citizens from the European Border Patrol database. The defendants argued that all members of the development team had access to the system from which the attacks were carried out and that any of them may have been responsible. Jacob Appelbaum, an internet activist and leading Tor member, pointed out that ALL evidence was provided only by CSC which means that it is possible that someone could have used  Anakata's system via a remote control device. Unfortunately, Anakata will be sentenced Friday, October 31st, and may face up to 6 years in prison. His 21-year old accomplice, however, was freed after the court date as he had spent 17 months behind bars for pre-trial detention.\n\n[color=white][b]Unix WGET Vulnerability[/b][/color]\nThe WGET Unix program is commonly used to retrieve files over the web using various protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The [url=http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-4877]CVE-2014-4877[/url] exploit allows attackers to, if recursion is enabled on the FTP server, create symbolic links, directories, and write to and execute arbitrary files. This can lead to privilege escalation, retrieval of passwords, or rootkits. This affects all Wget versions before 1.16. The popular pentesting framework Metasploit by Rapid7 has developed a [url=http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/server/wget_symlink_file_write]exploit module[/url] for this vulnerability. This vulnerability has aptly been labeled \"critical\" as nearly every Linux-based web server in the world has Wget installed, and it is imperative to update as soon as possible. It is unknown for how long this exploit has existed and been used in the wild, if at all.\n\n[color=white][b]Koler Worm Spreading by SMS[/b][/color]\nAs any Android user up to date on security threats will tell you, the Koler worm is a new ransomware program that blocks your device, claims that you have illegal content, and requires you to pay a fee to get it unlocked again. This worm is now spreading by SMS by spamming other Android users with texts and shortened links to malware. The ransomware requires a $300 fine payed by PayPal's MoneyPak. The text message sent has predetermined content:[list][i]\"Someone made a profile named -[contact's name]- and he uploaded some of your photos! is that you?\" [/i][/list] which is followed by a shortened link to the malware download hosted on DropBox under the application name \"PhotoViewer\". This type of social engineering has been having great success, especially with females. Once installed, the device is immediately locked and the ransom is required to unlock it, and spreads itself through your contact list.\n\n[b][color=white]White House Computers Hacked by Russians? [/color][/b]\nIt has been confirmed by White House officials that there has been a cyber attack on their computers and networks. Following the one week system disruption in the White House, many are stipulating that the hackers responsible for the attacks are working for the Russian Government and security organizations. Thus far, it is unconfirmed that any of the Government’s private or confidential files have been compromised. Fundamental services such as Intranet and VPN access were discontinued; however, services such as email were still accessible. “Our computers and systems have not been damaged, though some elements of the unclassified network have been affected,” the White House said. Vigorous security measures have been taken by White House official following the attack.\n\n[b][color=white]Akamai Technologies sees record-setting spikes in DDoS attacks. [/color][/b]\nMany of us have been victims of DDoS attacks in our lifetime, but have we ever stopped to actually think about how frequently denial-of-service attacks are occurring on a daily basis? Evidently it would be strenuous to track the wide array of DDoS attacks that happen daily, but one company has managed to do so. Akamai has reported that denial-of-service attacks have blown up in the past year, with a 389 percent increase. During the past quarter Akamai has defended against a mere 17 DDoS attacks flooding targets with more than 100 Gbps, the largest being a whopping 321 Gbps! The record-setting increase in denial-of-service attacks is most likely fueled by the increase in the wide array of available toolkits with easy-to-use web-based interfaces. It is said that online entertainment, media and technology companies were the most targeted.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=255459]Delirium™[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Android Encryption Greenlight[/color][/b]\nLast Tuesday, Google made a blog post regarding the state of Android security, and managed to mention one slight addition that’s going to make some people mad, and others very happy. With news of law enforcement cracking down on those who value their privacy, Google has stated that new Android devices with the most recent operating system will now come bundled with device encryption. Said to be “impossible to crack”, with efforts to show their customers how they value privacy the new “encryption” feature comes enabled by default. Along with the new encryption system, they’ve also added numerous new phone locking and unlocking system called “SmartLock.” With consumer privacy being a large issue in more recent history, Google is taking the right steps to spearheading the idea of “privacy plus security.”\n\n[b][color=white]Facebook Through Tor (Now Supported!)[/color][/b]\nFor those who have always wanted to stay “anonymous” while still giving Facebook all of your personal information, you’re in for a treat! With tons of pressure by users regarding privacy, Facebook has been more lenient when it comes to data collection and the requesting of personal information on their users. Another giant leap in proving that they’re not just a platform to publicize your info, Facebook has created their very own .onion link, accessible by TOR (The Onion Routing Network). The service connects users directly to Facebook’s “core infrastructure” or datacenter “rather than through an exit relay”.  Although it may only be in an experimental phase currently, if things go well, Facebook plans to go through with it entirely.\n\n[b][color=white]Drupal 7 “Mass Pwnage”[/color][/b]\nUsing the Drupal content management system may come in handy when managing a website, but when a SQL vulnerability is found in a module solely for the purpose of blocking SQL attacks like the ones mass exploited in the past couple days (go figure), things get a little crazy. Normally, when a vulnerability is found and responsibly disclosed, it is published, then attacks develop “proofs of concepts” for the vulnerabilities to test out the vulnerability, only the Drupal team themselves published the details on the vulnerability this time. When a major SQL injection vulnerability is found in a management system used by over a million sites, attacks “in the wild”, go wild. Attacks were so prominent in fact, that the Drupal team themselves stated “If you did not update your site within < 7 hours of the bug being announced, we consider it likely your site was already compromised.” This event alone just goes to show you that no matter how safe you think you may be, you must always be vigilant in securing your systems, and that you might want to check if your Drupal server is taken over by the Russian botnet.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Assassin's Creed: Unity Plot Twist[/color][/b]\nOne of the trailers released to the public has some pretty shocking information, which might be interesting to others. The specific video being discussed is the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW_-exDp3CE]Assassin’s Creed Unity: Time Anomaly Trailer[/url]. The setting of the game will take place in the 1940's, and without a doubt, most likely in Paris, France because of the Eiffel Tower being shown. In the trailer you will be able to put into your own imagination the vast and endless places to visit and the things you can do within the game. With new world activities, gear, and even introducing a co-op mode to play with friends, AC: U has a lot to offer. For the very first time in Assassin's Creed singleplayer history, you will be able to customize your player. In other games in the series you were allowed to buy new clothing and weapons, but nothing like this. You make the character, and you choose the new, exiting skills that the game includes in a skill-tree. With improvements on fighting style, gameplay, and other crazily cool things, you can also customize weapons to your liking. That's not all! Multiplayer has been introduced yet again. Assassin's Creed Unity also has a cooperative multiplayer, which allows others to aid you in you missions, with \"avatars\" so to speak to look as other Assassins. Assassin's Creed: Unity will be released on November 11th. \n\n[b][color=white]Blizzard Continues Their Journey [/color][/b]\nWhen most people think of November, they think of new game releases for the year or Thanksgiving, though, this November is special to Blizzard. Lead designer Ion Hazzikostas is proud to announce that one of the most popular MMORPG's to date, World of Warcraft, will be hitting their 10 year mark in November. Being introduced back in 2004, WoW has gained millions of dollars in profit, not just from World of Warcraft, but from Hearthstone, too. World of Warcraft takes the fourth spot in the Warcraft Universe series. The current team for World of Warcraft is said to be massive. Ideas for new expansions have been discussed by members from all of the different departments. Rumors of more expansions beyond Warlords of Draenor haven't been announced, but there possibly might be more. BlizzCon is near. Tune in sometime next week on for various celebrations and information on the game. In fact, Ion Hazzikostas says World of Warcraft will be here to stay until 2024 and possibly, maybe, even longer than that. \n\n[b][color=white]Live Action Advanced Warfare Video Released[/color][/b]\nWith the release of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare slowly, but excitingly approaching us gamers, Activision has released a public live action video, similiar to Treyarch's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 video. Many gamers can say that it looks similar to Titanfall and Destiny, Gamespot says. Furthermore, you will get a chance to see some of the futuristic weapons, items/gadgets, and the vehicles that will be seen by Advanced Warfare players. That's not all! Showcased in the video will be the new exosuit that the character you play within the game will be wearing. That being said, the exosuit will be providing assistance to players by giving \"super-human\" abilities, Gamespot says. Advanced Warfare is released on November 4th for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC. If you pre-order the Day Zero addition today you will have a chance to play the game one day earlier. This pre-order includes the following: \n[list][*]Two custom weapons.

This trailer, labeled a \"Cinematic Launch Trailer\", reveals several cut scenes which will appear in the game, as created by Blur Studios. Along with the release of this new trailer, Microsoft has recently made a promise that Halo 2 Anniversary will feature some “new story elements with extended cut scenes.” Halo 2 Anniversary is a part of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which launches on November 11, 2014 on the Xbox One. This trailer can be found on Microsoft's YouTube channel, but can also be found embedded in the spoiler below: \n\n[align=center][sp][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHnljglQ8Ag[/yt][/sp][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]The Crew's Second Console Closed Beta Begins This Week:[/color][/b]\nUbisoft announced the second console closed beta test for the upcoming game The Crew.

AT&T claimed that they made a press release, notified customers through billing and even text messages of the change but the FCC tears down their claims. For starters even customers who used less than 2Gb of data started to get throttled, just because they were on the unlimited plan. Secondly AT&T continued to advertise and sell their unlimited plan which was in fact very limited. The FCC plans to sue for monetary damages as well as make them change their terminology in their plans and contracts. Almost every major wireless carrier has been trying to get customers off of their unlimited plans, such as Verizon who just had their plans for throttling unlimited customer was shut down by the FCC. \n\n[b][color=white]Passport Concept: Blockchain ID And World Citizenship[/color][/b]\nChris Ellis created the worlds first bitcoin based passport with the use of the blockchain. With the blockchain and some encryption this could be one of the first steps towards world citizenship using a decentralized passport system that can be seen online as well as offline. Chris Ellis's goal was exactly that. Whether this new system will ever take off, it is fascinating either way and will help spread Bitcoin awareness.\n\n[img=300x300]http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/passport-layout-01.png?w=738[/img]\n\nTo see the Github project, you can go here:  [url=https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship]https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship[/url]\n\n[b][color=white]Andy Rubin, Android Founder Leaves Google[/color][/b]\nAndy Rubin who was the founder of Android joined Google when they bought out Android. He was then moved to the head of the robotics division in 2013 where he helped Google acquire several smaller robotics companies. His decision to leave Google is not because of issues he states, but because he wants to help hardware start-up companies by creating an \"incubator\" for them. Last week changes in Android leadership were made when the position was given to Sundar Pichai who was in charge of Google's Android and Chrome Apps. Hopefully he will be able to lead the Android team into innovation as well as Andy Rubin, but only the future can tell.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
