Europe, prompting possibly the last time clocks are turned back in the continent[/color][/b] \nToday, 28 October 2018, Europe will no longer be turning back clocks in coordination with daylight savings time. Ever since the European Union adopted this then-continental feature 16 years ago, it has been regulated by the EU, which states that time is continually switched on “the last weekend of March and the last weekend of October.” In August of 2018, the European Council recommended the EU to quit setting the clocks back and forth, and instead, use summertime for the year’s entirety. The recommendation was presented after 84 percent of 4.6 million applicants replied to a public consultation regarding the time change, where the overwhelming percentage of volunteers were in favor of abolishing time change. “The clear majority of those people would prefer ‘permanent summertime,’ while 36 percent were in favor of ‘permanent standard time.’\"\n\nAlthough from the results of the public consultation are very clear, the decision was not concluded without a feud. Those against the abolishment of daylight savings time say there are apparent drawbacks, whereas those in favor are insisting that the benefits are much more relevant than the downsides of eliminating this structured regulation being enforced for the past 16 years. Those for the abolishment argue that “having synchronized clocks across the EU saves energy and allows the single market to function better.” Whereas some are thinking ahead in the future, raising the problem that the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland could potentially end up in two different time zones once the UK departs from the European Union in March 2018. If the Republic desired, they could opt out of daylight saving time and being in a different time zone to EU countries. [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-28/daylight-saving-ends-in-europe-possibly-for-the-last-time/10438774]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]Thirty-seven dead in Europe so far as a result of anti-vaxxers[/color][/b] \nA recent outbreak of measles has been rampant across Europe, taking the lives if 37 victims so far. From January to June 2018, 41,000 recorded cases were present. In that six-month period, doctors saw “nearly double the highest number of cases in a year since 2010 - which was 23,927 in the entire 12 months of 2017 - and lost 37 lives to measles.” According to experts in the United States, America could also be facing this in the near future if parents choose to not vaccinate their offspring. Alberto Villani of Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital and the president of the Italian Pediatric Society in Italy told NBC that this is a very serious situation that should be enforced heavily and not be taken lightly. ‘People are dying from measles. This was unbelievable five or 10 years ago.’\n\nTo prevent outbreaks, no less than 95 percent of the population must be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine, which stands for measles, mumps and rubella. Seeing that less than the given percentage of the population is being vaccinated, Europe is now seeing a small outbreak of measles. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some parts of Europe are seeing less than 70 percent of vaccination coverage. ‘It's unacceptable to have in the 21st century diseases that should have been and could have been eradicated,’ says Anca Paduraru of the European Commission. Measles in the United States is already on the rise. Both Minnesota and New York have seen their worst outbreaks in decades. As of this article’s publication, there is a measles outbreak in Brooklyn underway, where six cases were presented just the week before publishing, all in unvaccinated children. \n\nIn short, please vaccinate your children.

This has been due to numerous reason: missed submissions, passive leadership, lack of Writ3rs, vacations and bans. Past week, I contacted a few people who posted on our [url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5893696]W4ITL1ST Recruitment[/url] thread and got those who replied in. Notable Threads and Dark Ops should be on track for Edition 415. Working on getting more Writ3rs so we can get our editions back to how they should be. After I see we've reached consistent and quality , I will begin recruiting for an Interview Team with Podcast following shortly after. Lots of work for those two sections so those will definitely not be in the near near future. \n\nSometime throughout this process, I have plans to execute Operation SPARK. It's been my avatar for a while now and I still plan on launching it. It's going to be some sort of rewards program to YOU, the readers. Nothing is set in stone, just a bunch of abstract ideas I have floating about along with a thread of a few concrete ideas. We'll see how it goes but for now I will leave you with SPARK? - a banner that has a meaning behind the lightbulb.\n\n[align=center][img]https://i.imgur.com/fHiZCCc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",
