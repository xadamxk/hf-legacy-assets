Today we get to interview a graphics legend on this forum, Buzz Lightyear! So Buzz, what brought you here to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]I originally wanted to learn how to hack Facebook pages, and I had to sign up in order to get all benefits of the site.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Interesting. When did you make the transition from being here for hacking to being here for the graphics?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]My dad had always worked with Photoshop some for his job, so I got curious and started playing around with it. The first forum I was over on had a signature section, so I started trying to improve and did free tags for people. Then after I joined here and saw that there was a graphics section, I instantly started spending all of my time there, and started getting involved in the sections.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's really cool. You're lucky to have had a parent in that field. Now for a while there you led Graphic Masters. How were you chosen for that and what was that like?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]I became close to iBruteforce back when he was still an admin. I was talking to him one day, and then he randomly messaged me saying \"You're a leader now by the way\". It was completely random. At that time Kantus and iBruteforce became lurkers, so while I was the newest leader, I was essentially the face of the group. It was really cool seeing how I was a rookie in the group then rose up to become a leader.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's really cool to hear. You're one hell of a lucky guy, not many people get the chance to actually talk to and befriend iBF. How'd you feel about him being the leader of GM but still dedicating all his time towards GFXF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]It felt like how a CEO is with a franchised company. He stopped in every once and a while to make sure everyone was still alive. Other than that, he was absent from the group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That seems to be the case with a lot of groups these days. Now, other than graphics, what other hobbies do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]I play lacrosse, and like to casually play tennis with friends. I also like hiking, biking, anything outdoors.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Oh wow, so athletic. :o Anyways, what are your goals? Not just here on HF, but in life as well, what do you wish to pursue for a living, etc?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]I plan on going to college for 5 years to get a master's degree in chemical engineering. After that, I want to go to law school to pursue a J.D. in patent law.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Oh wow. Those are both very hard subjects. What inspired you to pick those?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]Well, I always wanted to do engineering, and this past year in my chemistry class, my teacher made me really love it, so that's how I decided to do chemical engineering. I have also been told my whole life that I'm good with words and persuasion, so that caused me to want to be a lawyer (including the nice pay). But I didn't want to go through pre-law, and all of the English and writing classes, so I found patent law, which is a good mix of law and math/science.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's truly fascinating. I wish you the best of luck with both paths. :) So, here on HF you're a well accomplished member. You're highly respected in your field of interest, you've led one of the most respected groups on the forum, and your designs have been used in two official groups I believe. (If memory serves me correctly, you designed Red Lions logo and I know I had hired you to design Black Knights logo.) What other goals do you have here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]I'm just bidding my time, helping out in the group here and there until I eventually age out of the forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]D: That tends to happen to the good ones. You've accomplished a lot, your skills in graphics are top-notch for the gfx demographic here, so what keeps you here now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]I guess the community. Even though the group is for graphics, everyone within the group is also very close. We have many people say that we're the best group they've been in because how close we all are. We have one of the most active Skype chats, and everyone helps everyone out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's really good to hear. Groups are hard to stick around in when the members don't get along. Well, sadly it looks like our time is up. It was such a wonder being able to interview you Buzz! Hopefully you don't age out of HF for a long while! Do you have any advice you'd like to give to members before we go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear: [/b][/color][/url]If you post in the Rate My Graphic section, don't be upset when someone doesn't like it. Also, if you give a number rating to someone's art, chances are you're stupid.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172]Novica[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Today I will be interviewing an amazing GFX artist who goes by the name of Novica!

I want to give a shout out to my good friend Omar, and all my friends from Lannisters and The Brotherhood. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: When did you stumble upon Hack Forums? Did you join right away and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: Back in 2008 my good friend Darac told me about HF. At that time I was starting with graphics, so... as soon as I saw section on the forum just for graphics I've decided to join... and I'm really glad I did.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Your GFX skills earned you the GFX Guru award. Tell us a bit about that!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: One day I was going through the award page and I saw GFX Guru award... I wanted that award badly, as well as contribute to HF community somehow, so I've made my first avatar gallery for HF. Name of that gallery is \"HF14\", I've made another two galleries for HF though. One is called \"Tnzagreb\" and another \"Novica\".\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Lol. The Simpsons avatar pack. I didn't even know you made those. What else have you designed on HF? Userbars/Logos/etc?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: Ah, pedobear avatar is the best! :) I've also made the userbar for the group Legacy and Lannisters. I'm also working on a new userbar. I've also made tons of free graphics for the members of Hack Forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have a paid graphics service here on HF? If not, would you consider having one?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: I do have a paid graphics service on Hack Forums. I've made it a few days ago. This is actually my first paid graphics service here on Hack Forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: What graphical styles do you master the most? Which ones do you want to improve on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: Hmm. I really don't know. I'd say I'm decent at making userbars and maybe avatars. I would really love to learn vector style/graphics!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any other interests except GFX on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: Not really! I do post in gaming section from time to time, in League of Legends and World of Warcraft forum. But I spen 90% of my time on Hack Forums searching graphics section, I love to do one or two free graphics from time to time. :P\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#00BFFF]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any hobbies in real life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=502172][b]Novica[/b][/url]: Yes. I go to the  gym four times a week. And that's pretty much it...

DICE announced the game will hit public beta sometime in October for \"Battlefield 3 Premium owners, those that pre-ordered Battlefield 4 Digital Deluxe, [sic] and owners of Medal of Honor Warfighter Digital Deluxe and Medal of Honor Warfighter Limited Edition\" customers. DICE also revealed Battlefield 4 Premium, which includes five expansion packs that you can play two weeks before everyone else. More goodies include: Unique personalization options, priority position in server queues, new content every week, 12 bonus Battlefield 4 Battlepacks and the ability to transfer Battlefield 4 Premium membership from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4. Battlefield 4 will launch on October 29th for current generation consoles, with a next-gen version released soon after. You can view the Battlefield 4 Press Conference part below.\n\n[color=white][b]The Elder Scrolls Online - Too much money involved?[/b][/color]\nAccording to Zenimax Online, The Elder Scrolls Online will feature micro-transactions. Micro-transactions are unpopular real money purchases within a game. Players are able to buy items, name changes and more with these micro-transactions. However, is this too much? Earlier in the week, it was also announced that the game will have an online subscription, which will set players back $15 per month. \"Charging a flat monthly (or subscription) fee means that we will offer players the game we set out to make, and the one that fans want to play. Going with any other model meant that we would have to make sacrifices and changes we weren't willing to make.\" \"Choosing the right business model is part of that. We are going with the subscription model for ESO. \" Is this a good choice for the game? Or will it be unpopular with fans? Let us know by posting below.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft's CEO planning to retire[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft has announced that Steve Ballmer (Microsoft CEO) will retire within the next twelve months. An official retirement will take place once a new successor is chosen to lead the company. \"There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,\" Ballmer said in a statement. \"We have embarked on a new strategy with a new organization and we have an amazing Senior Leadership Team. My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our company's transformation to a devices and services company. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.\" It could be possible that his retirement was from the massive backlash of the upcoming Xbox One console. The announcement comes one month after Don Mattrick, former Xbox Boss, quit and joined Zynga. The Xbox One launches in November, however a proper release date has not been announced.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nBattlefield 4 information revealed at the EA Press Conference at Gamescom.\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GBhTIpjse4[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Minecraft to Sony Consoles![/b][/color]\nAfter a long while of maintaining exclusive to iOS, PC, and Xbox 360, developers of Mojang's popular game finally decided to bring the game to Sony consoles. The game is without a doubt coming to the Playstation 4 ([url=https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/369887484215164928]as mentioned by Playstation's official Twitter[/url]), however it still might visit other popular Sony consoles, such as the PS3 and the PS Vita. Notch, the creator of Minecraft, [url=https://twitter.com/notch/status/369892812185436160]nonchalantly mentioned the game's planned arrival to Sony consoles[/url] and based on some of the responses to said Tweets, it seems many people are excited for the upcoming release. Mojang also made [url=https://mojang.com/2013/08/minecraft-is-coming-to-ps3-ps4-and-ps-vita/]a post on their blog[/url] to confirm the release.\n\n[color=white][b]TU12 Finally Released for Minecraft: Xbox 360[/b][/color]\nAfter several comments from fans asking about the date of the patch's release, developers came out with statements not sure of when it would actually happen. \"We've never given a date for TU12, and when we know the date, we'll let everyone know,\" said a spokesperson for the game one day before they released the patch. The new patch is far from limited, as they've brought things such as the m implementation of new mobs (new to Xbox, as they were on PC prior to the release), new blocks and items, an increased map height, a new tutorial world, and many fixes to bugs that were noticed in the prior patch.\n\n[b][color=white]Plans for[/color] [color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color][color=white]?[/color][/b]\nAs mentioned [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3688111]in a thread created by Omniscient a few weeks ago[/url], HackerCraft, HF's official MC server, is due for closure. However, on the 21st of August, Omniscient himself made [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3688111&pid=34756757#pid34756757]a post[/url] regarding the server's sales and contemplation of what exactly he's going to do with it. Presumably, HackerCraft fans will probably see an announcement regarding the server and what's going to happen to it. Perhaps the server will be given another chance, but not much has really been said about the topic.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]LegacyPVP[/color][/b]\nLegacyPVP is a hardcore PVP server ran and operated by one of HF's very own members. The server offers popular plugins and features such as factions, PVP, McMMO, and its very own currency system. Players obtain said currency (called Legacy Scrolls) by voting, beating the difficult parkour, and completing various other challenges; once obtained, the scrolls can be used to purchase in-game items such as enchantment books, weapons, tools, armor, and spawn eggs.

Bradley released thousands of secret or confidential military files to the WikiLeaks website.\nUnder numerous charges such as violating the US Espionage Act of 1917, he potentially carries a life sentence for his crimes or at least 90 years in prison, so a minimum of 35 years is not a worst-case scenario. The court case had been in progress over the last few years, and only finally reached a conclusion on the 21st of August, 2013.\nMany supporters of Manning claim it’s an infringement of his rights of free speech, and that he should not be punished for what he did, although it is still a heated debate.\n\n[color=white][b]Internet.org[/b][/color]\nA collection of multinational corporations and individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Nokia, Samsung, Opera and Ericson bonded together to create \"Internet.org.\" This is an initiative which aims to connect the 3rd-world and underprivileged people of countries such as India, Africa and other areas where access to information and the Internet is limited. \nTheir slogan [i]“Today, the internet isn't accessible for two thirds of the world. Imagine a world where it connects us all,”[/i] sums up their goals and promises to be a new change for freedom of information. The amount of people who could potentially understand something new and share it with the world could be astonishing.\nThe official website for the project is [url=http://internet.org]Internet.org[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Syrian Chemical Attacks[/b][/color]\nA chemical attack by Syrian rebels earlier this week has caused conflict for the United Nations recently, as the Syrian government refused to allow the UN officials to observe the attack site. This could possibly mean that Syrian government has something to hide, due to Syrian government officials denying the Chemical Weapon experts the chance to try and help the defenseless civilians. However, it is more likely that the government is trying to protect the UN from being a target of any more possible attacks. Over 1400 people have been killed by these attacks, with many more unaccounted for or injured.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Field Trip App for Google Glass[/b][/color]\nBig news comes out of the small startup company, Niantic Labs, as they're now rolling out a brand new app-- Field Trip--for the Google Glass. The app is integrated into Glass in such a way where you can see it, but it's not as intrusive as many would think. Their intentions and ease of use seem simple. For example, if you're driving your car and pass a landmark, the app will alert you that you're passing it, followed by the option to read more about it or simply dismiss it. The app has other features such as places nearby (which will give you a list of places within what seems to be a five mile radius). It will also track the places you favorite and have recently visited from within the app, to save for later in case you ever want to go back. If you're ever on vacation, this app might be for you.\n\n[color=white][b]Amazon Testing Out Wireless Technology[/b][/color]\nAmazon is said to be testing out wireless technology for themselves; they're said to be testing technology provide by Globalstar, a company which provides service for satellite-connected devices (which have access to the network connection nearly anywhere). It's evident that both companies are looking to expand their spectrum and At this point in time it is unknown whether these tests will continue or if it will even be used by Amazon. \n\n[color=white][b]Competition for Google?[/b][/color]\nWith the numbers coming in for web traffic for the month of July, an unlikely company, Yahoo, tops the charts. Yahoo somehow managed to surpass Google in traffic last month, just sliding by 196,564,000, to Google’s 192,251,000. A lot of people have been guessing that Yahoo’s victor over Google came from their acquisition of the popular micro-blogging site, Tumblr. In the report, though, it is said that Tumblr’s visitors aren't being counted towards Yahoo’s monthly total. The jump in visits is being attributed to Yahoo’s revamp of the mail page, as well as the weather, sports, and news pages. Bear in mind that this report was only covering Desktop traffic. A report on mobile traffic, in which Google always beats Yahoo, is set to be released next week. \n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft CEO to Step Down?[/b][/color]\nSteve Ballmer had joined Microsoft in the 1980’s as the company’s first business manager. Around the year 2000, Ballmer was appointed CEO of the then fast-growing company and since has served many other positions within Microsoft over the years. Ballmer has made the below statement regarding his resignation. \"There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time. We have embarked on a new strategy with a new organization and we have an amazing Senior Leadership Team. My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our company’s transformation to a devices and services company. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.\" It is unclear at this point who the new CEO will be, but we do know that Microsoft’s board has appointed a committee to search for one. This committee will be headed by Microsoft’s lead independent director, John Thompson, and will also consist of the company’s chairman and co-founder, Bill Gates.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]2 Chainz Arrested[/b][/color]\n2 Chainz has became a part of Lil Wayne's 'America's Most Wanted Tour'. What Chainz didn't expect, was to actually be arrested. On a tour stop to Oklahoma City, 2 Chainz and various other members were arrested. Well, why was this famous rapper arrested? There were reports of drugs on the tour bus, and of course that's a big N-O. Refusing to let the cops come in, 2 Chainz locked everything they can so that the police couldn't come in. They wanted proof that the cops had a search warrant, and if they didn't they weren't allowed in. Surprisingly enough, the cops got someone to tow the buss away with Chainz and his crew inside! The following morning he was arrested. He didn't like that this happened because he smelled of weed and people reported this to the police. He has gotten tired and he wants it to stop. When the cops were done searching the bus, they found some narcotics, but they do not know who they belong to. Despite the fact that this happened, he tweeted he'll be coming up with a new album, and most likely he'll make an appearance on the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n[color=white][b]Kanye West Facing Lawsuit[/b][/color]\nKanye is currently being sued by a man because he supposedly hit the fellow. On July 19th, he arrived in California. He got into a little argument with one of the photographers at the scene where this all started. Others who have witnessed the actions from the rapper have stated that he punched and wrestled the man to the floor. Medical help was needed for the man and it was confirmed he was going to need special treatment to recover. As of now, Kanye hasn't been charged by the city of California yet, but if he was it would be classified as vandalism and assault. To make it even harder on Kanye, the man he beat up will be suing him in a different lawsuit. This is not the only time Mr. West has gone on a huge outbreak in public. Last month he told a photographer that he wanted the man to never speak again. West doesn't seem like he'll be changing his attitude anytime soon. He's still the same guy as always. He may think the tough guy look suits him, but now or later it will bite him in the back.\n\n[color=white][b]Ariana Grande: New Boyfriend?[/b][/color]\nThe Wanted's Nathan Sykes is currently dating the singer and Victorious/Sam & Cat actress Ariana Grande. The two have recently teamed up to make a duet and to top their relationship with a cherry, so to speak. The song is titled 'Almost Is Never Enough'. The lovely Miss Grande has been in various different relationships. One of these would include a member from group The Janoskians. Not only has she been in plenty of relationships, Ariana also has an Instagram picture of her with Justin Bieber kissing her cheek. People questioned if they were dating, but of course they're not. She eventually tweeted, \"Everyone, girls are allowed to be friends with guys,\" and \"I'm a lady. Chill out.\" Nathan is so in love with the 20-year-old star because he has been sending her flowers every single day! This isn't the only time they'll be teaming up; a new song will be released soon and it will be a big surprise.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8rGNk6vkM4[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nWell, this was certainly an interesting week for the Writ3rs. While everything ended up in order for this edition, I had to put the W4TCHL1ST to the test and watch it succeed--so that was rather satisfying. What ended up happening is that we had three long-time and devoted Writ3rs leave their posts for personal reasons, all within a short timeframe of eachother. So while it worked out to have them replaced, it was also saddening to see so many familiar faces disappear so quickly. Many changes have come to the Writ3rs, and I still don't know whether that's good or bad. But, until then, I bid you princely three adieu:\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody[/url] - User News : 24 editions : 02/23/13 - 08/25/13\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white]Retribute[/color][/url] - Proofreader : 39 editions : 11/25/12 - 08/25/13\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121196][color=white]Natha[/color][/url] - Headlines : 26 editions : 02/17/13 - 08/25/13[/list]\n\nOn a side note, a scandal was reported to the News team: our own Tech News writer was plagiarizing from other news sites.
