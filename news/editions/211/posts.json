Lots of drama has been focused around him with numerous $1,000+ scam reports. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] cracked down on [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][color=#383838][b]Αnonymous[/b][/color][/url] and closed him for his scams. It is possible that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][color=black][b]Vinnie[/b][/color][/url] might also get closed, but he is currently banned for \"A 3 day ban as agreed upon just because we both need time to think.\" You can read [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] post about the situation [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4396926&pid=43035246#pid43035246]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]New EP1C Feature[/b][/color]\nOn October 26th, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has implemented a shortened search flood time for all EP1C users, meaning instead of the standard 25 second wait it is now down to 5 seconds. This will make searching for those forgotten threads a whole lot easier. Also added is an EP1C Ub3r feature making the flood time for posting and sending PM's only 1 second, and you must be both EP1C and Ub3r to use this feature. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated that abuse of this feature to spam will result in a closed account. You can find that post [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4507617]here[/url]. Also stated by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] the price for EP1C may increase again soon too. He would like to rebuild the upgrade system asap.

However today [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] changed that and made it no longer accumulative and it is now a one-time donation of $500+. Those who have already donated in hopes to get the MD award have until December 1st, 2014 to meet the old requirement of $500 in pure donations to obtain the award. After that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] will not grant the award based on accumulation. If you have not started to accumulate donations toward MD before today then it's not possible for you to get it through accumulation. The reason behind this is because [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated that the accounting is a bit of a pain when mixed with crypto currencies. This will make his life easier and will also allow him to create automated methods for donation award payments.

How goes it? Do you have any shoutout's you'd like to make before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I could fill a whole page with nothing but shoutouts, but I'll keep it to a few. Magicmann, Parazyd, 'Sin, Doctor Blue, MeshCollider, Abraham Lincoln, Cray-Z, Angel, Pillows, ~Dec, Xen0n, BoomShot, and the list goes on. To all those who aren't on this short list, yes, I'm giving you a mental shoutout.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Right on right on. How long have you been developing websites? In your opinion what's the best way to learn how to code sites?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I've been doing web development for over six years, back when I got bored of not being able to afford energy drinks and iced tea in school, and it just snowballed from there. Since then, I've transitioned from basic HTML, to MVC sites built with Node.js, and NoSQL databases. As for learning to make sites, there is no substitute for learning by doing. It's the way I started, and it really gives you a crash course primer like nothing else can. However, if you like having a guide, I highly recommend looking at Bento.io, which not only gives you resources to learn each language, it also gives a roadmap for what you should be learning next.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So do you mess around with any other languages?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I've taken a foray into a few different languages. Lua, Go, C++, Ruby, and a few others. I'm planning on making Go one of my mainstays, but right now I'm still learning the syntax. From what I've seen, Go's great for plowing through massive amounts of data, so I may try making a movie app of some sort with it to practice. As for Lua, I'd love to try making a game with it. There are few languages I've seen that seem tailor made for game development as much as Lua is.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, sounds exciting. Have you had any time to check out Apple's new programming language \"Swift\"?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I've seen a few posts about it on HackerNews, but I haven't looked into it much. I'm not much of an Apple guy, despite being a former iPhone owner. However, from what I've seen from it, the syntax looks sexy as hell, so it may be worth learning if I ever get a Mac. (Damn you Apple, and your proprietary development strategies)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah no doubt.. lol. You have to admit, Mac's are beautiful. Anyway, if you don't mind; tell us more about how you discovered HF and why you're active.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I discovered HF back in 2011, back when I thought hacking was all based around omnipotent exploits, and those free hacking tools were what professional penetration testers used. After spending a month or so begging for free tools, I started learning about SQL Injection, and made my first (mostly useless) tutorial on how to use Havij. If I remember correctly, I even made it *shudders* Post to PM, which has since been banned. After maybe six months or so, I lost interest in HF, and sort of faded away until about October of last year, when I logged back in, and started making tutorials, and helping people out, which became sort of addicting to me. The same reason why I spend a lot of time contributing to open source software. From that point, I started entering upgrade contests, and got my first upgrade to l33t from Cray-Z, and my upgrade to Ub3r from Parazyd, all in the span of something like two months. After that, I started hanging out in the Crypto Currency section, helping out there until it seemed to go downhill quite a bit, into basically endless referrals and spamming about random new currencies. Not my racket. Aaanyway, moving on. Somewhere in that period, Aurora started Omnicoin, but it quickly petered out, which led me to try and revitalize it into the Omnicoin it is today. A bit of a long-winded summary of my time on HF, but that's my story.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh cool, yeah I always see you helping others out (myself included) so thanks again for that! How do you feel HF could improve? What steps should Omni take to make HF \"better\" (if any steps at all)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I'm always happy to help! As for improving HF, there are some things I'd love to see. I really wish the Cryptography, Encryption, and Decryption forum wasn't just home to endless threads about Crypters, but instead filled with actual information on encryption. I'd also like, for purely selfish reasons, see much more integration of Omnicoin with HF, perhaps for more upgrades than just 3p1c, or even for stickies. It'd also be great to see more activity in the OMC Exclusives Market. However, all in all, HF is pretty fantastic as it is.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah I agree OMC is falling off a bit. So what is your position in the Writ3rs and what do you do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] I co-write Omnicoin News with Doctor Blue, so generally, I try and give HF a little taste of Omnicoin every week, just to keep everyone interested. There are some big things planned that I don't want to discuss until they're ready to go, but I'll talk about that more when it comes time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Okay fair enough. How has your experience been with the Writ3rs? Do you enjoy being apart of the team?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] It's been quite enjoyable. The Writ3rs has quite a cast of characters, yourself included. It's a decent amount of work, but enjoyable nonetheless. I've been writing in various contexts for years now, from music blogs to a half finished novel, so writing up some topics for HF News is a good way to keep my skills sharp. Even if I stop writing Omnicoin news, I hope to stay involved with the Writ3rs in some way, shape or form. Maybe movie news, if that still exists if and when I cease writing Omnicoin News. The experience is something I wouldn't trade for the world.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh we'll always have room for you here. Windows, or Linux?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] Both. I spend most of my time on Windows, albeit somewhat begrudgingly, but considering most of my Steam games are Windows only, it's my mainstay OS. However, I've hacked on it to the point where it's damn near usable as a Linux box. Cygwin, Git Bash, Dexpot for Desktop Virtualization, tmux for terminal multiplexing, plus a lot of programs for personal taste. Sublime Text, Glasswire, Firefox, etc. I haven't installed a Linux distro on my current laptop, since it hates the Network Card on it by default, but I usually use Manjaro Linux, Fedora, or Debian.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, I'd like to thank you for joining us tonight. If you have anything else you'd like to say, please do so now!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] For anyone out there that just wants to talk about anything, feel free to shoot me a PM. I'm always interested in talking about activism, web technologies, LGBT, furries, caffeine, entrepreneurship, startups, or anything really. Also, thanks so much for interviewing me! It was a hell of an experience.

My Ma and Pa do shit right. I also used to run with Jeezy and the original 8732 crew. And Jesus man, son of God. You know.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm at a loss for words, what a lovely story. So how are things going for you, what's new?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1092491][color=#EFEFEF][b]TheCause:[/b][/color][/url] Homework and strip clubs pretty much. I get high every now and then. What's new with you?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Just working and school. How are you enjoying your classes?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1092491][color=#EFEFEF][b]TheCause:[/b][/color][/url] They're brutal. College is a lot different than highschool. And my teachers always pick on me. They're like, \"OH, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON DO YOU?\" or \"WRITE AN ESSAY ABOUT DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE. NO NO NOT THAT COMMUITY SERVICE THECAUSE!\" Idk, it's fun. I play poker with one of my teachers, and he gives me better grades. And I buy another teacher chicken wings, and he gives me better grades too. idk\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So what are you studying?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1092491][color=#EFEFEF][b]TheCause:[/b][/color][/url] Computer Science. It is a real pain in the ass. I have a lot of math classes. As much as I love math and how it correlates to everything in our lives, I have to take Calculus and I am just not feeling it. My computer teacher has a degree in cryptography though, so that's pretty cool. No matter how old you get, school is still school :D.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I suck at math so come over and help me out. How do you feel about the recent OMC buzz?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1092491][color=#EFEFEF][b]TheCause:[/b][/color][/url] I haven't really gotten into OMC. I was a little late off the start and lost track of the market. I've dabbled with BTC and was going to buy some, but I got bills to pay and vodka to buy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Still on the liquor?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1092491][color=#EFEFEF][b]TheCause:[/b][/color][/url] Oh yeah.

This attack was messy, albeit effective, and has since been patched by Microsoft as well as fingerprinted for Network Intrusion Protection Systems (NIPS). Since then, hackers have developed a way to embed the executable directly into the OLE object in the form of a picture image file, and use the INF file to rename it as an executable and add it to the RunOnce folder in the Windows Registry. Ironically, a patch in 2012 is capable of preventing this new attack, but since people simply don't update their systems as frequently as they should, and it was a rather unimportant update that seemingly accidentally blocked this attack, it's a widely available and severely dangerous vulnerability, especially because it works on all currently supported version of PowerPoint.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Google Strengthens 2FA[/b][/color]\r\nTwo Factor Authentication (2FA) is a protocol developed to have an extra step in accessing a certain account or action such as an e-mail, a text message, or a phone call. Google has now developed USB Thumb Drives that allow you to log into your account without receiving a text message. This will allow Google Chrome users to plug the USB devices in and use a password without receiving a text message but still have 2FA installed. Though I personally believe that using a USB key over a text message is a decrease in security (since the USB key is much smaller and more likely to be taken without notice), the protocol itself dubbed \"Universal 2nd Factor\" (U2F) will pave the way for many devices, applications, and various usages to have the requirement for physical presence and 2FA. Google has aimed towards high security and has built-in preventative measures against Man in the Middle (MitM) and Phishing attacks by only establishing a connection after it is ensured that the site is really Google and not a forged one, though RSA and SSL/TLS have their vulnerabilities so I wouldn't bet on perfection.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Dropbox Credentials of 7 Million Members Leaked[/b][/color]\r\nThe popular cloud storage website and application, [url=https://www.dropbox.com/]Dropbox[/url], has had over 7 million login credentials of members leaked. Anton Mityagin, a Dropbox security devloper, confirmed that the hack did take place, but also made a statement that the hack was not carried out directly on the Dropbox servers or website, but was rather a result of phishing, Man in the Middle, and other 3rd-party attacks. He also made a statement recommending not only that Dropbox users change their passwords, but also that all internet users should use different passwords for each important site, as the Dropbox credentials have been used to access other sensitive non-Dropbox related data. Dropbox does have implementations of security measures that will allow them to see suspicious activity such as multiple login attempts, logging in with various accounts on the same device, and failure of 2 Factor Authentication. Mityagin strongly recommends that all users enable 2FA, but should still regularly change their passwords for the highest amount of security.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Microsoft PowerPoint Vulnerable To Zero-Day Attack[/b][/color]\r\nIt's looking like there will be no end to the constant Windows zero-day attacks. Recently, Microsoft patched three or more zero day vulnerabilities in Windows which were all actively exploited by unknown hackers. Now, a new zero day vulnerability has been released which has been affecting all supported releases of Windows operating systems. This is not including the Windows Server 2003 operating system. Microsoft has issued a temporary security fix for the new flaw and has also confirmed that the zero day flaw is being exploited by hackers through the limited targeted attacks as caused by a small number of malicious Microsoft PowerPoint documents being sent as E-mail attachments.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]The Bash Vulnerability: How To Protect Your Environment[/b][/color]\r\nRecently, there was a hole discovered in the security of the Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) which has the majority of the Unix/Linux. (This includes the OS X.) This, in response, caused the administrators to sweat bullets. Attackers and hackers have already attempted to develop exploits to release on non-patched web servers, network services, and daemons that use shell scripts with environment variables. This includes network equipment, industrial devices, and more.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute shell commands on a server due to a problem in how the bash interprets environment variables such as cookies, hosts, and referrers. Therefore, exploiting this allows the hacker to run shell commands directly. Once they have access to run the shell command, they will own the server.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=255459]Delirium™[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n[b][color=white] Verizon Wireless User Tracking[/color][/b]\r\nIn an age where privacy means everything, the company mainly known for their cellular service Verizon Wireless, has been found to add certain “cookie-like tokens” to all data being transferred throughout their cellular networks. With hopes to profile their users, the company started this user tagging little over 2 years ago. The main purpose of the profiling was not to snoop around, but instead to provide targeted ads to their users, or so they say. Although Verizon says that the tagging is private and secure, researchers have found that the userIDs (or UIDs) that the service sends over as part of the advertising directing system, can “let any de-anonymize you.”\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Literal “Heart Attacks”[/color][/b]\r\nDon’t be fooled, we’re not talking about “the second coming of the notorious Heartbleed bug” here, instead a more macabre subject relating to malicious parties and medical system flaws. Taking the word “life-hack” to a whole new level, The Department of Homeland Security’s Industrial Control Systems-Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), has said that numerous pieces of medical equipment suffer from backdoors that could potentially be used to harm, or even kill patients. An unconfirmed “300 devices from over 40 vendors” could potentially be at risk, not to mention all of the devices that may have vulnerabilities that we might not know of. With hopes that we won’t ever have to see attacks carried out on patients with plans to harm them, ICS-CERT is put between a rock and a hard place when it comes to patching devices like the ones vulnerable.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]One USB to Rule Them All[/color][/b]\r\nWith 2-factor authentication becoming increasingly popular, the forerunner in technology in security Google, has released a USB to help aid users with using the newly popular security method. Aptly named “Security Key”, the universal serial bus matches passwords with logins, and logins with identification, meaning the device proves you’re really the user you say you are, and are legitimately trying to login to whatever it may be. Using the “open Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol from the FIDO Alliance”, Google states that any website using the same protocol, can incorporate Security Key into their login systems. With measures in place to prevent bad guys from accessing your accounts, and priced at only $17.99, Google’s goal is to incorporate 2-fact authentication everywhere, and plan to start that process with this simple device.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Play Station 4's 2.00 Firmware Update Finally Gets a Release Date[/color][/b]\r\nSony has finally announced the release date for the highly anticipated \"2.00\" firmware update for the Play Station 4.

After inserting a USB stick loaded with music into the PS4, a new option for USB Music Player will appear. Supported filename extensions include MP3, MP4, M4A, and 3GP.\r\n[*][b]Change colors[/b]: In addition to the ability to add a theme, PS4 owners can also change the background of the home screen from light blue to one of seven new colors: gold, blue, red, green, purple, pink, and gray.\r\nPlayers You May Know: PS4 will now suggest players you may know as potential friends in the ‘What’s New’ section.\r\n[*][b]Enhancements to Live Broadcasting[/b]: Masamune brings a variety of improvements to live broadcasting on PS4. In the Live From Play Station app, PS4 owners can now select a Featured channel, which includes official broadcasts from Play Station, broadcasts from people on a players friend list, and any game channel that the player has followed. Additionally, Live From Play Station now has filters for searching broadcasts on a specific game, as well as support for archived broadcasts.\r\n[*][b]Content Area and Library[/b]: PS4’s Content Area, which shows the latest games and apps a PS4 owner has used, has been redesigned to help make it easier to quickly find and access content. It now shows 15 of a player’s most used apps or games, and additional items will be added to a player’s Library. The Library on PS4 has improved filter and sort functions to help organize contented by type (game / app / TV & video), name (a – z or z – a), recently used, or install date.\r\n[*][b]Enhanced Voice Commands[/b]: The ability to control PS4 using voice has been improved. Players can now say ‘Play Station’ to begin commands, and ‘All Commands,’ to see a list of all voice command options available. New voice commands were added for live broadcasting, including “Start broadcast,” “End broadcast,” and “Find face.”\r\n[*][b]Add To Library[/b]: The monthly free Play Station Plus games will have an ‘Add to Library’ button in the Play Station Store. This button will add a game to a PS4 owner’s library without downloading it – saving space on their hard drive.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Hearthstone Making an Appearance on Mobile[/color][/b]\r\nThe popular PC card game Hearthstone will be available on android devices by the end of this year. Blizzard also announces the game will be available for iOS devices soon too. Hearthstone is home to over 20 million players and is currently a success on the iPad as well as on the PC. The upcoming versions will be on an android tablet, and then mobile phones. Players will be able to manage their decks, and play where ever they go. WiFi is always a must for most people in this generation. If you're ever on the road with 3G, Blizzard has setup the game so that you hopefully won't get disconnected. Even when going through a tunnel. This is a bonus so that you don't lose connection or you aren't able to make your move. Blizzcon is approaching, as November is quickly arriving. An expansion set with 100 new cards are may be shared with the public then.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]GTA: San Andreas Really Is Coming to Xbox 360[/color][/b]\r\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas will be coming to the Xbox 360 soon enough. Have you ever tried returning an original Xbox game? Most of the time the employees will deny accepting the game for a trade in. It has been said the newer version won't be accepted for trade in after release either! That's because it will currently only be available for download in the marketplace! Rockstar Games recently had pictures leaked of GTA: San Andreas. Rumors appeared across the internet after someone leaked the pictures of the achievements the Xbox 360 version has to offer. Rockstar announces there will be 11 secret achievements to unlock. In the past, members were able to purchase the original Xbox version via the 360 marketplace, but it has been removed without most gamers knowing. While the older version will never be on the marketplace anymore, fans of San Andreas should be expecting the newer version out on October 26th. Ten years ago GTA: San Andreas was released. Celebrating this special even to Rockstar, the company will be holding a special weekend which includes special clothing, discounts, double RP and double the money for Grand Theft Auto Online. This is a plus for some; when playing original Xbox games on the 360, it would sign you out and force you to be offline. That's no fun!\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Halloween Themed Events[/color][/b]\r\nAs Halloween approaches, candy-time is not the only thing to get excited for. Gamers who play the popular games Counter-Strike: GO and Team Fortress 2 series will be able to access Halloween based items within the game. Furthermore, CS:GO players should be expecting spooky masks, ghosts and zombie chickens when playing the game. Not that many people would expect a game such as CS:GO to have such a festive-like look to it. Valve has taken the time to use Team Fortress 2 and Payday 2 masks and incorporate it into CS:GO for the time being. In addition to that, you might see some of the dead teammates roaming around the map as ghosts. Team Fortress 2 on the other hand has had Halloween events in the past. This upcoming Halloween will be the 6th fun event for those interested participating during the time period. Lastly, as this is taking place, you will be able to participate in the past 5 events too!\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Xbox One November System Update Announced, Available in Preview[/color][/b] \r\nXbox Live's Major Nelson revealed this past week the Xbox One's next update.

Currently, Roger's is rolling out this new network in select cities, but it has already shocked many users. The reason this is big news is because Roger's is officially the first carrier to launch an \"LTE-A\" network. Some people are dubbing this as \"5G\" since people with LTE-A can stream videos with insane speeds. Overall, Roger's says their tech improvements will be giving users a much better mobile experience, especially since they are combining AWS and 700MHz spectrums. If you live in Canada and would like to know which cities already have LTE-A, check the list below.\r\n[sp]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Vancouver\r\n[*]Edmonton\r\n[*]Calgary\r\n[*]Windsor\r\n[*]London\r\n[*]Hamilton\r\n[*]Toronto\r\n[*]Kingston\r\n[*]Moncton\r\n[*]Fredericton\r\n[*]Halifax\r\n[*]Saint John\r\n[/list]\r\n[/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Honda's Pedestrian-Detecting Technology[/color][/b]\r\nSomething pretty neat is being released later this year by Honda. Subaru, Volvo, and Ford are some other car manufacturers who released an anti-collision feature, but Honda has taken an even more in depth approach. Honda has launched an enhanced driver-assistance system which not only detects vehicles, but even pedestrians. It works by using a radar in the front of the car, and a camera on the windshield. The system gives the driver both audio and visual warning that a collision may occur, and if it is sudden the car will automatically break to avoid impact. Some other unique features with this system include a sensor to determine if you're driving in the middle of the lane, and even a traffic sign detector that displays speed limits or other signs on the display. This \"Sensing\" technology will be released with the Honda Acura before the year ends.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Ubuntu: 10 Year Anniversary[/color][/b]\r\nOpen source OS users are celebrating. Recently, the Linux based OS Ubuntu turned 10 years old. Ubuntu is one of the most used Linux distributions, and to celebrate the company released Ubuntu 14.10. In this new update, Ubuntu has a large amount of new features and information under the developer tool center. Some of these new features include Android app assistance, and support for zero-setup printers. This release is a pivotal step for all Linux operating systems, and shows how far a Linux based OS can come. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]New Company Creates Gun Hardware That Tracks An Officers Gun Draws, Shots And More [/color][/b]\r\nA new start up company based in Silicon Valley has taken to creating a device that will let all police officers in an area know if another has drawn and/or fired their weapon within their vicinity. A physical piece of hardware is required, and is embedded into the gun itself. This will allow police in extreme situations and unable to call for help to call for backup, or alert others of the situation. It can also show the direction it is currently facing, and the direction of shots fired. Also, if a police officer's gun is stolen or moved from its designated holding spot at home, it will send an alert to their phone. This hardware is intended for police, not for Government enforcement on civilians. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Hand Exoskeleton Created For Virtual Reality[/color][/b] A company called Dexmo Robotics has begun creating a exoskeleton for you hand that is used for detailed hand use in video gaming. This will be great for virtual reality games and really shows us how close we are to obtaining a fully functional virtual world. They already have fully functional units, and are looking to enhance and produce the exoskeleton for mass use. As of right now, it is in its early development stage, but as soon as they reach their goal and are able to manufacture their Kick Starter quota, they will start shipping out development kits to those who helped fund them.\r\n\r\n[img]http://images.gizmag.com/inline/dexmo-1.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFor more information and to get involved, check out their [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1277630932/dexmo-an-exoskeleton-for-you-to-touch-the-digital?ref=category]Kick Starter[/url].\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Facebook Releases iOS App Allowing Anonymous Chat Rooms[/color][/b]\r\nFacebook has created an app on iOS that allows users to anonymously chat on a variety of use made chat rooms. The app is called \"Rooms\" and is separate from the Facebook platform. The app is influenced by the early day of the  internet according to Facebook, similar to Yahoo chat rooms in the early 2000s. It will feature high customization options, mod settings and more. If you want to check it out, you can download it now from the iOS App Store here: [url=http://www.rooms.me/download]Rooms.Me[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://images.gizmag.com/hero/facebook-rooms.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
