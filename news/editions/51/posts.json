Would you like to make any opening statements?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] Hackforums! It's a pleasure getting interviewed.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color] So. Why did you join HF?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] I was searching for Gmail bruteforcer and landed up here.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color] If you had to pick one person to give the Member of the Month award to, who would it be?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] Peter Chao\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color]You have been here for a long time now, What big changes have you seen in this forum?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] Well, when I joined this forum wasn't so big, Around 50k members, Scam report section was dead, Lounge was better than now. I spent time learning about new things. Good ol days. :P \r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color] You are the third longest-serving staff member, How do you feel about that?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] Feels great to serve such a big forum with such a cooperative team.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color] Would you consider yourself the hardest working staff member? if not who would you say is?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] Hardest working staff in the sense? Let me clear this up, Some staff's do reports more, others take their time resolving other complain, So everyone is doing their job, Yes I said JOB.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color] So.. Would you consider your self the harshest staff member?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color]  I warn for almost every infraction, if members think it is harsh, I would say this is my job, get used to it.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color] Off that, I know you were scammed out of $2k. Being you now have experience doing deals, what would you have done differently?\r\n[color=lime][b]Rusty_v:[/b][/color] It was feb 2010, I dealt with him before, everything was fine but I didn't knew of his intensions.I sent him $1250 for exchange to WU. Took away my money + Around $5k from other members. As the quote says \"Everything happens for a good reason, Keep walking\" I take care while dealing with members, I've made over $60,000 USD from hf, so I don't really care about those scams anymore.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ:[/b][/color]That really sucks..

First thing I would like to ask, what made you join Hack Forums?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™ :[/b][/color] I found HackForums on Google, when I typed in ''Hack free Brazzers accounts'', Then obviously I sign up and PM'ed the Brazzers account seller.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  When you first joined, what did you think of the forum?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] I was quite active when I first signed up to be honest. Why? I see users giving away free stuff such as ''Free YouTube Subscribers'' ''BOTS'' and free Steam Accounts etc. Therefore, why I'm very active. The atmosphere back then and now are the same. In fact more TROLLS and Noobs now.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  What do you think of the recent HackForums Changes ? \r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] What changes? There isn't any changes? I'm still waiting for the ''VOUCH'' System to be announced. I joined HackForums 20th April, 2011, and now 8th July 2011, still the Vouch system hasn't finished and completed yet...\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  What is your favorite group, and why is it your favorite?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] My favorite group is probably the Alliance group, because I like the shiny badge hehehe.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  Which award do you feel most proud of? Why do you take so much pride in it?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] I'm very proud of my ''Fish Err Man'' Award. I take so much pride, because I'm an Award slut.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  What member do you respect the most on Hack Forums?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] Omni, nuff said.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  What is your favorite section on Hack Forums? Least favorite?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] My favorite section on HackForums is Innuendo section, because I LOL, LMAO, ROFL most of time because of the topics. My least favorite is the Playstation 3 section, because I haven't got a PS3.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  Hmm I see That you love cats, do you actually have one ?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] Yes, I have. I will post a video soon.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  That's really cool. Anyways, if you were in Omniscient's position, what would you change about Hack Forums?\r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] If I was Omniscient, I would change the layout colour. Purple and green is not a good match?\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  Thank you for your time, any final comments? \r\n[color=#0066FF][b]SeaNanners™:[/b][/color] Well, I would like to thank you for taking the time to interview me and also the HF news team for all the work that they have done.\r\n\n[color=#FFCC00][b]Seductive™:[/b][/color]  This concludes our interview, thank you SeaNanners™ for your time![/spoiler]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNClassifieds.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[align=right][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1416451][img]http://i.imgur.com/F3Qub.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=left][url=http://www.mskeys.in][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/X3GG1.jpg[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNTeam.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[color=white][b]Publisher & Head Writer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848]Qwazz[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Publisher's Assistant[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033]xerotic[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Writers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712]Cobalt[/url][list]\r\n[*]Headlines\r\n[*]Other News[/list]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=545127]Joey Tribbiani[/url][list]\r\n[*]User News[/list][/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Reporters[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453]ReactioNz[/url][list]\r\n[*]Head Reporter[/list]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=129444]3x0r_$c0rPi0n[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]chocothunda[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=126243]Decoy[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=115612]-BoodyE-[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=657392]Astonish is NJ[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=509788]Seductive(TM)[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Editors[/b] [/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=70881]Paradoxum[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=234024]Deities[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Graphic Designer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671]panDa.[/url][/list]",
