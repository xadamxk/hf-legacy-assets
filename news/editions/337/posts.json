Commonly referred to as 'New Ebola' the effects of this virus include various forms of binging, weirdness and obsession with Japanese culture. The CDC has announced that typical signs include obscure Japanese names, nonsensical anime references and major obsession with something referred to as Senpai. If anyone should come across \"Senpai\", it is highly advised to avoid it at all cost or you too will suffer from Weaboo. \n\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]Time Travel Now Possible[/b][/color]\nAfter years of tachyon study and attempts to discover new particles through use of the hadron collider under the Swiss-French border, time travel has finally had a breakthrough and found to be currently possible. Studies have shown that while it is impossible to move backwards in time, we are currently able to move forward through time. Scientists say that in order to perform this leap through time, one must simply do nothing. A great example can be expressed through the very reading of this paragraph which has approximately taken you about 10-20 seconds which can be attributed to the fact that you are still reading and have actually moved forward that same 10-20 seconds. While further studies are being done to increase this leap forward through time, we must first utilize other means of energy such as the fingers used to type this and waste another 5 seconds of your life thus increasing the initial 10-20 seconds to 15-25 seconds further proving that advancements in time travel are being made.\n\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v3/WorldNews.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Sozin's Comet Soon to Reach Earth[/color][/b] \nSozin's Comet, also known as the Great Comet is a celestial object that passed by the earth every one hundred years.  The year 1917 was the last report of the comet passing by the Earth. Every time that the comet year happens, it will enter the upper atmosphere just skimming the surface of the earth. Nothing that would harm us. The father of Prince Zuko and Princess Azula, Fire Lord Ozai said that the comet offered great powers.  Ozai called it, \"the power of a hundred suns\". A lot of people from the fire nation grow stronger as the comet approaches and a few notable names like Aang, the Avatar gain a tremendous amount of fire energy that could be problematic if used in the wrong way. But sadly the Avatar Aang was nowhere to be found and the Fire Nation attacked.

On March 30 a group of penguins had flocked towards the continent and taken over the oceans surrounding it. A group of scientists noticed glaring red eyes in the distance coming towards their igloos and were unsure of what these entities were. As time went by, the penguins soon came over and swarmed the scientists' igloos. One survivor of the attack made it safely to the other side of the continent where he was able to call for help. The Navy Seals arrived and it was a full on penguin and seal battle that lasted for two days, and thanks to the Navy Seals everything is okay.

Now you might be wondering, \"what is so scary about these foxes?\" Well an eye witness to these foxes had a little story to share. His name is Alex Wright from North Dakota. He states that on his way home from McDonald's he had spotted something following him. He had no idea what it was and he was pretty freaked out. Alex decided to go an alternate route home in order to get rid of whatever was following him. To his knowledge that had gotten rid of whatever was chasing him. It is pretty creepy when something is following you, so it is not strange at all that Alex did this. Alex had heard from people in his small town about reports of a weird fox that has been spotted not only in his area of North Dakota but around the world too. The sun was setting and Alex was almost home. As he got near the street to  his house he felt the strange presence following him from before. He turned around and noticed something following him. He thought nothing of it and continued walking. As Alex got to the driveway of his house, he still had that feeling that someone was watching and as he turned around he noticed a very cute furry fox girl who shouted out, \"NOTICE ME SENPAI\".

Many people have said that the movie is \"whitewashing\" and that the presence of no Japanese people are going to ruin the anime.  It will be interesting to see if the creators over at Netflix will leave any of the plot out considering it is a movie rather an a TV series. Either way the movie looks not so great but only time will tell.

In Japan alone it was estimated around 1.4 million people went to go see this movie. Worldwide it was estimated almost as much as the japan screenings with sales of over 0.7 million people. The sales of the movie in Japan earned 2 billion yen which in U.S. dollars is equal to $17,957,360, while worldwide the movie earned 600 million yen which is $5,387,208. If you are lucky enough to go to the sixth and seventh week of the anime you will get the chance to get two original cardboard posters from the character designer of the anime. Depending on the week you go, will determine which poster you get. The 6th week viewers get a Kirito and Eiji poster while the 7th week viewers get Asuna and Yuna! [i][size=x-small][url=https://otakumode.com/news/58d388483cd780434d63f650/SAO-Brings-in-More-Than-2-Million-Yen-in-Japan]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]Dubbed or Subbed?[/color][/b] \nPopular debate in the anime community is whether or not you liked dubbed anime or subbed. Two very popular streaming services for anime fans is Crunchyroll and Funimation. Crunchyroll showcases animes usually in their raw Japanese form with subtitles, while Funimation has dubbed versions of your favorite anime. The reason this is being brought up is the fact that the anime creators put so much time and effort in what you do, that when you purchase these streaming services you are helping the animators and developers tremendously. Both services offer free services where you need to watch ads before watching the full series and then they also over premium services. No the HFNT is not a sellout! We are not forcing you to purchase these subscriptions. Just know that dubbed anime is not that great and anyone that says it is better than subbed needs to go to a doctor. Like seriously. if you do not watch subbed then why do you call yourself an anime fan. Go back to Cartoon Network you pleb. (There are some cool dubbed anime do not hate me thanks.)
