First of all I'd like to thank [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][b][color=#32CD32]xerotic[/color][/b][/url] for giving me the opportunity to write this week's HF News, and also I would like to thank the new member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=709615]Tuskarr[/url] for helping me with the making of this edition. With that being said and proper given start, now start reading!\n\n[align=center][img]http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/8496/headlinesr.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis was a really tough week for the administration, here at HackForums. We had a bad weekend with our DB server, our DB tables became corrupt and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#00BFFF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] had to revert to backup. We had to revert 2 times to the Monday 4am backup we had, in order to keep HackForums up and running. You can read about the two disasters [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1109867][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1112579][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1112217][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url].\n\n[hr]\n\nAlso as a side effect from the failure we had the day before, our smiley system was completely changed. This means, some of the current smileys were replaced with the default smileys and some default smileys were added without replacing the current ones. The member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=507936][b][color=#1E90FF]mladen190[/color][/b][/url] started a thread notifying us of this glitch, to read the thread go [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1113469][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url].\n\n[hr]\n\nThere were lots of threads that many members started on the upgrading system. Some upgrading payments to l33t were denied, because the IP address didn't match with the billing address used on PayPal. To read more about that, please go [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1116625][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url].\n\n[hr]\n\nA lot of bugs and glitches happened in the last week. I do not know if they were regarding the failure of the DB or they are known bugs. The member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=639914][b]VanCliffe[/b][/url] (me) made a thread telling the administration how easy the reputation system to bypass is, but unfortunately they already knew about it so it wasn't a big use to them, to read about it click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1114319][b][u]here[/u][/b][/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/300/usernews.png[/img][/align]\n\nWelcome to this weeks edition of User News. This week had a little drama as well as a bit of a breakthrough for the users on HF. Let's talk about the drama first. The user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=307821][b]/A/ (Ace)[/b][/url] got his account hacked two times. The hacker who did this used his account to gain free stuff from the members. Today, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=307821][b]/A/ (Ace)[/b][/url] posted a thread notifying all of the members not to contact him via his main account, to read about it go [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1122725][b][u]here[/u][/b][/url].\n\n[hr]\n\nToday [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][b]Hanzo[/b][/url] (the administrator), posted a thread to tell the members when they can PM him to report reputation abuse and when they can't. I think that the rules are pretty much amazing, having in mind that he might be getting 200+ reputation abuse PMs. Read about it [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1120960][b][u]here[/u][/b][/url].\n\n[hr]\nThe user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=188920][b]Paramore[/b][/url] posted a scam report against [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=101228][b][color=#1E90FF]Tate[/color][/b][/url] claiming that he scammed him. The dispute was done over an e-Book which you can find [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=989547][b][u]here[/u][/b][/url]. I think that Tate didn't scam him, because he actually told him in PMs that he requires proof, Paramore continued to ask for a refund which makes this a little bit suspicious. Read more about the scam report [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1123143][b][u]here[/u][/b][/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848][b]Qwazz[/b][/url] is the leader who replaced [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][b][color=#32CD32]xerotic[/color][/b][/url] in The Rats Crew.

He is claiming that he didn't seen that repfuck coming, because he was banned and the ban lasted for 3 days.
