Both positive, negative and neutral were all disabled. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made a thread explaining the changes; he is re-working the reputation system to prevent future abuse and flaming. The new reputation system will have a [b]set[/b] drop down of reasonings to give reputation. Custom comments will [b]not[/b] be allowed from there on. For example some of the positive reputation reasonings will be: [i]\"This guy is my friend\", \"I had an awesome deal with this member\".[/i] Keep in mind these will be changed and more will be added. This is just a quick example of what [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has in store for the reputation re-work.

Members such as [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b]Tibit[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=619030][b]iNviZ[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1232842][color=#0066FF][b]#Skyline[/b][/color][/url] have been known to be jacked. A lot of important business related logs have been leaked, and a lot of information put at risk. In light of this, we would recommend clearing your chat history if you get the chance and feel at risk.\n\n[color=white][b]Leadership Changes to Legion and Recruitment Launched[/b][/color]\nEx-leader [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771][b]Vіnnie[/b][/url] has resigned from the leader position of official group \"Legion\".

Today, were are joined by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736]Eminent[/url]. Would you like to be make any shoutouts before we continue? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] My friends from Graphic Masters, The Alliance, and AA. AnalVoyage, Happeh, Tasemu, Black Hole, BagHead, Satoru, AlbinoShadow, Teh Hacker, AlbinoShadow, but most importanty, you, CM <3 [size=xx-small]I thought listing a lot of people here would make me seem popular[/size]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] D'awwhh, aren't you a cutie :3 So, Emu, what was it that first brought you to HF? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] In 2009, the Runescape account that I had been using for years got banned, and so I decided I would quit for awhile. The random though occurred to me \"I should be a hacker\". I spent about a year after that studying things online, learning how computers work, and for the most part just dicking around with command prompt. Summer of 2010, for the first time, I got the idea that there might be a place where other people, with similar interests, all gather. So, I Google'd \"Hacking Forum\". Consequently, HF was the first result. Yeah.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Now that you've been apart of HF for as long as you have, have you completely diverged from your roots? Or do you still partake in those activities?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] I've changed quite a bit. I wouldn't say the roots are still gone, though. I think it takes a specific type of person to become a good hacker, and you won't ever really vary from that mindset. However, I don't do nearly as much of that anymore. I got into anime which kind of made everything else unappealing, and pretty much consumed my life for awhile, but then I started doing graphics finally. I've been doing graphics for the past 10 months or so now, and I'm planning on sticking with this one for awhile.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I see! In your time here, have you seen any sort of \"shift\" in the HF community? Be it with trends or just a change in general.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] Of course! With the change in average age, along with site age, member count, etc., it's natural there would be quite a bit of changes.\n\nIt's difficult to judge if the site has changed for better or worse. Most of the members that are considered \"legends\" on HF were in their prime when I first joined. There was an extreme amount of quality members that seemed to be dominating the community, and new trends and ideas were constantly being created by them. As I grew as a member and eventually became more like them, I didn't have as many people to look up to, which made the site look a lot worse. As far as overall quality though, I do believe that the site has improved, and it's continuing to go in the right direction with it.\n\nGroups on the other hand, I can't say the same for. Custom usergroups are a big issue at the moment imo. When they were free, the idea for the group had to be good enough that Omni would approve, but when anyone with money could buy one, of course it wouldn't be that good. I'd like to see groups take a step in the right direction, and continue to revolutionize, and change the forum, since they have a huge influence on the site. But yeah, groups and members are probably the biggest changes I've seen\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Do you think there has been one (or, at least one) constant in all of your time here? For me, personally, it would have to be Paradoxum and The Alliance - it seems as if both have been a (huge) part of my HF experience ever since I first joined. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] I would have to agree with you on that one ^.^ TA probably had the largest impact on me as far as HF goes. Omni seems to be extremely similar to how he was when I joined, so it's good to see that a growing forum hasn't changed how he runs things. The biggest constant that I see is that, in pretty much every section, the same things are posted every single day, without much diversity. Threads and post are really repetitive across the boards tbh\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] What's your take on this whole fiasco with Skype accounts getting stolen?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] I think it's getting out of hand and ridiculous. Moreso, I believe it shows how vulnerable Skype is. It would be nice to see Skype add additional security layers and try to prevent things from happening further, but I don't foresee that happening very soon\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] It's so annoying. But it also sheds light on what goes on behind the scenes and gives a different perspective on some members. Why can't people just be nice :(\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not sure. If everyone was as nice as you though, the world would be a better place <3\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] You're such a sweetie pie 😊 Thanks for the interview! Anything you'd like to say before we conclude?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=430736][color=white][b]Eminent:[/b][/color][/url] To everyone reading this, just remember, with a little Rusteeze, you, too, can be just like me. You just need to believe :) \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Oh man, I didn't see the hidden message until now. LOL.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406]Froggy[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  Welcome to your interview for the HF News, Froggy! I'm sure you have some shout outs to make before we begin.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] Of course! A huge shoutout to all of the Empire and Terror members and all staff members, they have all been very kind to me. Specific shoutouts to ʝosh, panda, bugga, DNAS, ShadowCloud, Viral Dragon, Vinnie, Baked, BV1, Orgy, xadamxk, Coffee, Judge Dredd, Omniscient, Tibit, mad, regexks_ and KyleWTF. These members have helped me out in one way or another while I have been on HF. Sorry if I forgot anyone!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  What a list! First things first: How, when and why did you join HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] Over the last couple of years, I remember having stumbled upon HackForums hundreds of times through different google searches. I never bothered to join until I met someone that convinced me to. I specifically joined in May of 2012, so I am still a fairly new member. My main goal when I joined was to learn more about networking and programming, as it all ties to my future college major and profession. I stayed for the community. HackForums is definitely a unique forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  Let's dedicate a part of this interview to talk about the wierd/funny events that happened on the night between Friday and Saturday (you getting a +1k rep from Omni, becoming a Mentor and getting that cool award). Was becoming a Mentor one of your goals on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] Becoming a Mentor was not one of my specific goals, but it is an honor! It was, without a doubt, unexpected. All I can do now is take this responsibility and not abuse this new status.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  I believe you were away/sleeping when all this happened, right? When did you find out about this and how did you feel about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I was indeed asleep when everything happened. I abruptly woke up this morning to a phone call about something completely unrelated. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fall asleep again so I checked my iPod for messages, and I couldn't believe it when I had an iMessage from Tibit and KyleWTF saying congratulations. I thought \"yeah right, what trolls\" but decided to log on to HF anyway. It wasn't a troll at all! I was honestly more than excited, I felt like happily hopping all over my room\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  Alrighty, enough with the topic Mentor promotion and again, congradulations! Do you have any hobbies IRL?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] Of course! I have a lot of hobbies, but I mostly find myself raving with all sorts of things, such as poi, orbits, gloves, and hoops. Light shows are really interesting and they allow me to be as creative as I want. Other than that, I enjoy a lot of computer-related hobbies such as resolving issues and repairing computers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  Nice! Do you make money online as most big HF users or do you have a job IRL?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] I do not currently hold a job IRL, though I have had several in the past. I use a few methods to make a bit of cash online, though I'm most \"known\" on HackForums for selling fan signs. I've made a few hundred just from that, believe it or not! I really mostly want to focus on my studies as of now so I can earn some big money in the future.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  You should give me a fan sign for fee sometime 😝. Anyways, you're leading the Terror group on HF. I heard rumors about the group being sold. What are your thoughts on that? I've heard that Terror is a family-themed and welcoming group to be in.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] There has been a lot of speculation about Terror being sold, but nothing  is set in stone. So far it's the usual \"I'm going to buy Terror!\" chit chat coming from other members. The only official news is that Baked and I are attempting to come up with the money to purchase Terror and take it into a completely new direction. We already have set plans, but nothing will be revealed until it actually occurs. We're not 100% we'll be able to purchase the group though, but we're trying out best!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  Do you have any goals for your future on HF? Please share some with us!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] The only solid goal I have would be to join the Malware Removal Team. It's a lot of work but it would be an amazing learning experience and would help me in my future career. I applied for it, and I'm hoping for good news on April 30th when they PM those who have been accepted.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]  Thanks for spending time to take part in this interview! Any final words, Miss Froggy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320406][color=white][b]Froggy:[/b][/color][/url] A huge thanks to Omniscient for the Mentor opportunity, and a thanks to you for interviewing me. 🙂\n[/spoiler]",

This week includes a snapshot with a few new features (although not nearly as many as last week), as well as a pre-release for the next minor update; 1.5.2, being a small patch, includes the following fixes:[list]\n[*]Jukebox audio volume doesn’t decrease\n[*]SMP: Anvils charge level for nothing when using languages other than English\n[*]Tamed wolves and cats despawn\n[*]Endermen are rendered hostile if they take environmental damage\n[*]Pick-Block and Furnaces\n[*]Achievement \"Hot Topic\" Uses Faceless Furnace Icon\n[*]Using the anvil for free\n[*]Arrows visually float when shot into a block.\nImprovements to FPS when using high-resolution texture packs\n[*]Many Realms fixes.\n[/list]\nAs far as the snapshot goes, new mob mechanics, a new block, and new terrain settings were implemented. Zombies will now multiply upon taking damage, which should make monster hunting exceptionally more difficult; for example, when zombies take damage in sunlight they will now multiply and begin to spawn rapidly. Although this may just be an issue overlooked by Mojang, it has caused a bit of discontent within the Minecraft community. Deserts have received a facelift this week in a change that Mojang claims will \"Make deserts more deserty\". Specifically, this change has removed all water (with the exception of large rivers or oceans) from the middle of deserts. A new hardened clay block has been added, crafted by smelting blocks of clay; this block is a reddish-brownish clay block which has a higher explosion resistance than normal clay. Finally, a new nametag item was added which allows the player to rename previously spawned mobs, and extra tooltip info was added to the creative search tab.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1MM.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Next Xbox Revealed on May 21st[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft announced that they will reveal the next generation Xbox on May 21st at Microsoft's Redmond campus. Microsoft is expected to share their vision and lay some rumours to rest in the sixty minute press conference. Major Nelson stated that the next generation Xbox conversation will continue nineteen days later at E3 Expo where Microsoft will show the full lineup of blockbuster games. \"On that day, we'll share our vision for Xbox, and give you a real taste of the future. Then, 19 days later at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, we'll continue the conversation and showcase our full lineup of blockbuster games,\" said Xbox's community guru Larry \"Major Nelson\" Hryb.

Monaco was set to hit the marketplace on Wednesday for 1200 Microsoft Points. “We just discovered that there is an issue which requires that we push back our Xbox Live arcade game release date a little,” said developer Pocketwatch. “We've already submitted an update to Microsoft to fix the problem, and as soon as we know that the issue is fixed we'll have a new release date. “I know our fans have been waiting a long time for the game, and hopefully they'll have the patience to wait just a little while longer.  What's mine will be yours very, very soon!” A new release date hasn't been announced yet, but it shouldn't be too much longer.\n\n[color=white][b]Next Call of Duty May Be Revealed Soon[/b][/color]\nThe next title in the Call of Duty series may be revealed soon as more documentation was leaked.

The country singer star bought a new mansion in Rhode Island and paid for the property directly, in cash. Taylor had been considering to buy the property for a few weeks now according to a magazine. She was photographed looking around the place with her family in town on April the 15th. Real estate sources have reported that the home is around 11,000 sq ft and is situated on 5.23 acres of land. The asking price was thought to be around $20 million however Taylor got a good deal by eventually managing to bargain the property down $17.75 million. She made the purchase in cash for the sole reason of being able to avoid any form of delay in claiming the property. Movers were spotted transferring her belongings into the building early on Saturday morning. She was also rumored to have been looking for purchases in Connecticut. However, her budget for a place there was far lower and reported to be around $4.3million.

They're never going to be best pals, but they're at a stage where they can enjoy each other's company,\" a source reported to a British magazine. \"Britney feels guilty for what she put the boys through, so she's doing what she can to give them a stable life.\" Meanwhile, however, Britney is currently happy in her new relationship with David Lucado, a law firm employee, after she split from her fiancé Jason Trawick in January. Their romance is said to be going very well. \"He is so down-to-earth, but also very smart, funny and Britney is really smitten with him. He's like a breath of fresh air... he has that Southern thing in common with Britney.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Kristen Stewart Insecure About How Well Her Boyfriend Gets Along with Katy Perry[/b][/color]\nKristen Stewart apparently feels uneasy about Robert Pattinson's recent bond with Katy Perry. The two stars first meant last year, when Robert was on a break from Kristen. Katy is believed to have turned to Robert for support following her recent split from John Mayer. Although Robert is now dating Kristen again and is \"just pals\" with Katy, Kristen is a little worried about how well they get along. \"Katy was Kristen's friend first, but she gets on with Rob brilliantly. It's clear to everyone that Rob's got a bit of a crush on Katy and she totally plays up to it,\" a source has revealed. \"They wouldn't act on it, but it still makes Kristen feel insecure.\" Robert was seen holding hands with Kristen at the recent Coachella music festival, but he also spent a significant amount time with Katy. It has been claimed Robert enjoys being around Katy because she is so free. \"Rob's a huge admirer of Katy and she was really there for him when things went wrong last year. Kristen loves Katy, but she's also quite intimidated by her. Katy's so carefree, fun-loving and girly, Kristen feels the total opposite, and seeing how Katy connects with Rob worries her, especially as he's been so distant recently.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkBSHrtoynA[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Ol.jpg[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI really hope you'll take a moment to read the philosophy that I have posted within this parent forum. [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3447379]The Philosophy of Reputation[/url]. These upcoming changes will affect the users in more ways than they realize, and someone needed to truly vocalize the importance of the reputation system. All I'm hoping to accomplish is that the members' eyes will be opened to the full ramifications of these changes and possibly to show their support for the philosophies proposed. We need to be aware of what these changes really mean for the community. If there is any possibility of salvaging the current reputation system, this may be the means to do so. \n\nMuch love,\n-Sir",
