To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=162]here[/url].\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HFheadlines.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[align=justify]It has been another interesting week here at Hack Forums with the re-opening of the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=134][color=white][b]Suggestions and Ideas[/b][/color][/url] section. Previously closed, members will now be able to suggest their ideas to help improve the site. Several suggestions have already been approved including several new sections.\r\n\nTwo new sections were created by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]. The first of which was the brand new [url=http://hackforums.net/announcements.php?aid=2][b]Reputation Abuse Support[/b][/url] section. The section will be used to report flaming and scam-related reputations, and as well as PMs hinting to or asking for reputation. In this forum, privacy is to be respected. You cannot see threads other than your own. No doubt this will help tremendously in the ongoing abuse problem.\r\n\nAnother section that has now been created is the Xbox Live [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=195][b]Gamertag[/b][/url] section.The section will help the free the Sellers and Buyers Market Places of the clutter from numerous gamertag sales threads. You can find the original suggestion [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1297620]here[/url]. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] increased the thread character limit from 15,000 to 18,000 characters. No doubt this will greatly help in the posting of long tutorials, and as well as of the logs in the analysis section. In addition, the amount of pictures per post has been increased from 15 to 18 as well. \r\n\nLast Monday, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] announced that a member post recount had occurred, taking into account the fact that Site News and Feedback, Suggestions, and also Member Contests posts will not count toward a member's post count. It is apparent that many members will see a decline in their post count [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has stated simply, \"Don't complain either. It's done.\" The official statement and discussion can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1297906]here[/url].\r\n\nIn addition, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has announced via Twitter the new requirements to purchase HF L33T. The new requirements are simply 25 posts and your account must be one week old. You can read the tweet [url=http://twitter.com/#!/hackforumsnet]here[/url].\r\n\nOne of Hack Forums' administrators, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=#4DD0FC][b]Hanzo[/b][/color][/url], known to be the go to guy to report rep abuse to, gave his first negative reputation this week. The rep was given to the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=442957][color=#0066FF][b]Bree Olsen[/b][/color][/url] with the comment, \"LQ Member\". If you truly care enough you can take a look at the reputation [url=http://hackforums.net/repsgiven.php?uid=4066]here[/url]. \r\n\nFor the other news, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][color=Lime][b]xerotic[/b][/color][/url] received a free iPod Touch from [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=247588][color=#0066FF][b]Smurfy[/b][/color][/url] to prove to him that his service was legitimate. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][color=Lime][b]xerotic[/b][/color][/url] gives his personal vouch to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=247588][color=#0066FF][b]Smurfy[/b][/color][/url] and says that he trusts him in all buying and selling deals.

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=284502][b]Tha Sneak[/b][/url] has created a thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1288147][b]here[/b][/url] explaining the common issues in the said section. You better read that first before attempting to \"help\".\r\n\nThe HijackThis Team has successfully finished the voting for their new user bar, created by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=70881][b]Paradoxum[/b][/url].

Sony reported that their servers are not still secure however. Because of this, Sony has recommended that any users with compromised accounts to change their passwords immediately after they obtain access to their accounts. With all this bad news, Sony tries to amend it by offering free games. \r\n\nFor previews of a new show on CNBC -- Code Wars -- Hack Forums was featured for around a second. This could bring many good members, or many people that are coming wanting to learn how to become L33T h4x0rs. We hope that the former will happen, though the latter is more likely.\r\n\nDue to La Niña, the counter-part of El Niño, Colombia is facing some extreme rains. The rains are ruining their crops and depending on the ending crop count, their economy could possibly be wrecked. Colombia is the second largest producer of Arabica coffee. With La Niña, Colombia’s production of the coffee has declined by 2.4% because of the rains. The effects of La Niña is supposed to decrease in the following months.\r\n\nWhat’s the biggest medical problem that comes to your head? Most of you probably thought cancer.\r\n\nWell researchers in Canada have found a very simple cure for cancer. This may sound like great news, but pharmaceutical companies aren’t interested in it. They aren’t interested in it the cure because it can’t be patented. Because of this, they can’t make any money from it.[/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HFinterviews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n[hr][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 1 - Condoms[/color][/font][/size]\n[spoiler]\n[align=justify][color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What made you decide to have the username 'Condoms'?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] Just because it seemed funny. I use to be \"Importance of Condoms\". Educating people on safe sex. But my name was too long. So I just decided to shrink it to Condoms and that's what people call me now. Plus it's a name I use now on whatever site I join.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What is your favorite Hack Forums section, and why?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] I like The Lounge because I can be sarcastic and everything else. I also like the Giveaways and Marketplace sections a lot even thought I don't buy things that often. It's still cool to see what people are selling.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Do you like the recent additions of new awards, new sections, and new L33T requirements, etc.?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] I don't plan on earning awards. :/ Sections? Since when? L33T requirements? Heck that doesn't phase me one bit. And I have no idea what they are.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What is your favorite new award that Omniscient has added?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] I like all the awards. Omni should give me one for doing this interview. 🙂\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What new things would you like to see added into Hack Forums, and explain each.\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] A better mod than Nyx-? Nah, JK. He's cool. Personally I don't know what Hack Forums needs. We pretty much have everything there is to need. Although Staff is perfect just the way they are. Nothing needs to come.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Do you admire any Hack Forums members, if so, name them.\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] I don't know why ... Prone. I also like Iceybunny or whatever her name is. I think she still owes me phone sex.. <3 ... wait ... Was I supposed to say that?\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What are you future goals for Hack Forums?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] I really want to get to 5000 posts. And 1000+ rep. That's my ultimate goal. But I also want to be put out there and be cool and person people can rely on.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Do you prefer condoms, or unprotected sex?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] Shh! Don't tell anyone but I'm a virgin. 😖\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What do you think of Яǝʌǝɹsǝ's recent scamming?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] Scamming is scamming. It shouldn't be tolerated.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] If you were stranded on an island with Michael Jackson and Osama Bin-Laden, and 1 condom, who would you rape? Why?\n[color=#0066FF][b]Condoms:[/b][/color] If you use a condom and have sex with someone ... is it rape? And possibly neither. If anything, let both of them go at it while I enjoy the show.[/align][/spoiler]\n\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 2 - Joey Tribbiani[/color][/font][/size]\n[spoiler]\n[align=justify][color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What is your favorite group, and why is it your favorite?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] As of now, it's The Alliance. This group has been an inspiration for me and a pretty helpful source of learning.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What do you want to do 10 years from now?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] I would like to become financially independent. I am aiming at making it big in the field of cyber security.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Would you ever want to be president of the United States? Explain.\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] Since I am not an American, I don't think I can. Anyway, going by the meaning of your question, I would say no. I detest politics and would never like to get into it. Too much drama out there.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Do you think \"an eye for an eye\" is fair? Explain?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] In most cases, I do believe in an eye for an eye. But, each situation is different.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] If you had the opportunity to live forever, or rid the world of world hunger, which would you choose? Why?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] I wouldn't want to live forever in a world where the problem of hunger and poverty keeps getting drastic.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] What section do you hate the most, why?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] Deal Disputes section. As far as possible, I avoid visiting it. Too much sadness there. 😝\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] If you could vacation a year anywhere, where would you go?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] France, Australia and Switzerland.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Do you believe in superstitions, ghosts, afterlife, etc.?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] Not at all.\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] Besides me, who do you love the most on Hack Forums?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] From the top of my mind: bugga (been a really nice friend and helped a lot), Factor8™ (he is extremely friendly to talk to), Paradoxum (he is the reason why I am no longer just a loungewhore), Xypher (he is plain awesome), cobija and AsSaSs@iN for their dedication towards helping members disinfecting their machine and finally, phire nuk3r. There are tons of other members, but not everyone can be mentioned here, right?\n\n[color=white][b]Security™:[/b][/color] If today was your last day, tomorrow was too late, what would you do?\n[color=white][b]Joey Tribbiani:[/b][/color] For me, the best option would be to hang out with my friends all day right till the end. Nothing beats a fun day with the ones you love.[/align][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HFcredits.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Publisher & Head Writer[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848]Qwazz[/url][/list]\n[color=white][b]Publishers Assistant[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033]xerotic[/url][/list]\n[color=white][b]Writers[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712]Cobalt[/url] - Other News\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=153686]Fireren[/url] - Headlines\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url] - User News[/list]\n[color=white][b]Reporters[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=126243]Decoy[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=114470]F4T4L 3RR0R[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453]ReactioNz[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=168826]Tyler777[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=629674]Waldo[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=200751]Zach[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=115612]-BoodyE-[/url][/list]\n[color=white][b]Interviewer[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=92059]Security™[/url][/list]\n[color=white][b]Editor[/b] [/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=70881]Paradoxum[/url][/list]\n[color=white][b]Graphic Designer[/b][/color] \n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671]panDa.[/url][/list]",
