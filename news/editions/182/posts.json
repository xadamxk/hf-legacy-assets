A new forum has been created in the Online Accounts marketplace section:[url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=309][b]Non-Free Accounts[/b][/url]. In the announcement thread, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4063140][b]Non-Free Account Forum[/b][/url], it is stated that the new section is for the sales of paid or subscription-based Internet accounts such as Netflix and Minecraft. After almost two years of dis-allowance, Minecraft accounts are once again allowed to be sold on Hack Forums. Accounts being sold must be sold on a per-account price bases with no minimum, must not be accounts intended for the viewing of adult material such as pornography website accounts, and sales threads can only be created by Ub3r members. These changes are the result of member feedback on a thread made a few weeks back, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4016503][b]New Account Sales Rule[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Mobile Forum Reorganization[/b][/color]\nThe mobile forums have received a reorganization this week, combining them under the Computer tab into the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=79][b]Smartphone, Mobiles, Apps, and SDK[/b][/url] forum. Within the new section are sub-forums including Android and iOS, with Android Development now residing in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=192][b]Android Operating System[/b][/url] forum. The change was announced on [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/433667147407958016][b]Twitter[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] on February twelfth, most likely influenced by a suggestion thread made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#EFEFEF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url] at the beginning of October last year. Said thread can be read here: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3793542][b]Mobile Sections Suggestions & Changes[/b][/url]. These changes will hopefully decrease confusion regarding where to post certain material, and will surely increase interest in aspiring developers getting their feet wet in the complicated ocean of mobile development.\n\n[color=white][b]Advanced Hacking[/b][/color]\nFilled with members from all across the spectrum, from veteran programmers to \"master hackers\" who use LOIC to take down entire countries, Hack Forums has gained a new section this week under the Hacking tab of the main navigation menu. The brand new [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=307][b]Advanced Hacking[/b][/url] section now encompasses the sections [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=92][b]Botnets, IRC Bots, and Zombies[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=126][b]Cryptography, Encryption, and Decryption[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=231][b]Pentesting and Forensics[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=229][b]Decompiling, Reverse Engineering, Disassembly, and Debugging[/b][/url]. Not to be confused with the upgraded members-only [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=93][b]Advanced Methods[/b][/url] section under the VIP tab, the new section is available to every member who wishes to apply their skills in that area of infiltration and exploitation.

Welcome to this weeks edition of the news. How are you doing on this fine Friday?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm doing fine. How about yourself?\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Doing just fine. So, tell us about yourself. Who is Anima?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] First, we'll discuss how I got my username. It was around the summer of 2012 I believe. One of my first groups ever was the group Rhythm. Back in those days, I wanted a cool and unique name. What did I do? Well, I just thought, and thought. Finally, I came up with the name Anima Libera, which is based off of a song I used to listen to. It then stuck to me. Now most of my friends know me by Anima. Oh, and if anyone does not know what Anima Libera means, it translates from Italian into English as \"Free Soul\" which I thought was cute. Now about myself: I'm a very shy guy who loves to play games. If you've been friends with me or spoken to me, you know that I can be nice at times and really rude other times. That pretty much sums up how I think of myself. 😝\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What genre is the song? How'd you like Rhythm comparing it to the groups that are around on HF currently?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] Damn, I don't even know. Hah. The one I based my username off of was a different type of remix; the nightcore one. (I wouldn't recommend listening to nightcore if you're very picky with what you listen to.) Rhythm. Wow. That's all I can say. I really miss the group, I truly do. It's how I met ALL of my current friends on HF. I met you, Saturday, and a whole bunch of other great guys. Inside the group was a sub-forum filled with various discussions and we were a family. I know most people said it was a lounge group, but does that really matter? Positive paid for the forum, he could do as he wish. As long as the posts were posted with quality it was fine with me. As it's no longer a group, I can't really base it off the current ones we have. I guess you can say the Writ3rs is a family to me too. This is currently the only group I truly love and I love everyone in it. I would be devastated if I had to say goodbye and be kicked. I love everyone in it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] We love you too, Anima. Did you mainly sign up on HF with your sails set to learn how to hack? Or something else?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, it's kind of a long story. I met this guy on Xbox Live one day back when CoD 4 was at its primetime. Everyone loved it, everyone played it, it was the current CoD that was out at the time. When meeting this guy, he told me had a brother which I thought was cool. The two played Halo since the first game, as well as the second on the original Xbox, and they told me to get Halo 3. I did get it. I was horrible and complete trash, oh my gosh. I noticed that his brother was the highest level in the game; a 5 Star General with 50 Skill (I forgot how it's classified as. (Sorry my Halo fans) I asked how he did it and he told me he used to boot kids offline. Come on, that sounds pretty cool, right? Being able to take whomever you want down. His brother and I started talking on Aim, got to know each other, and I brought up the question: \"Can you teach me how to boot kids offline?\" He later said yes, and my adventure starts here. I downloaded teamviewer, he told me to go on HF, signup, I did, and the first thread I read was Brent538's or something like that thread with downloads of various different booters. After that, I kind of moved over into the ratting section because I thought that was even cooler.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Do you still talk to those guys on Xbox or on HF, perhaps? So -- it's pretty safe to say that gaming brought you onto the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] No, never in my life will I talk to those two. My friend constantly spammed me whenever I got on to play with him and it was annoying. As for his \"hacker\" brother, I blocked him and realized that even thought he threatened to boot me off and \"hack\" me, I knew there were even more scary people out there. I blocked both of them. Hah. Oh, and I quoted hack and hacker because now that I know a little bit more, I know he couldn't do sh*t. So yes, gaming did bring me here!\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Wow, what kind of friends are those? Also: What do you think of HackerCraft? Do you play Minecraft at all? Or are you mainly an Xbox player.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] I completely lost contact with them two years ago. I have no idea what their alias' are and I do not care. I love HackerCraft. I wish I was able to get the original HC award, but sadly I was too late. I've been on the server for at least 2 weeks and I love it. Some say it's dead, but it's very active to me. Like I said, I wish I was able to join at the start of the server when it was booming with players. So yes, I do play MC. I'm actually on now working on my farm! Hah. I'm thinking about selling my 360. With the new generation of consoles, I'm not too fond with them. I recently invested in a gaming rig, which I'm satisfied with to some extent. It sometimes pisses me off. >_<\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Built a custom PC, eh? I need to do that sometime whenever I can scrape up some money for it. Do you have any future plans for HF? I believe that you've been on the HF News team for quite a bit.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] Nah, mate, I didn't build it; my cousin did. Lol. I've joined the Writ3rs as a Wiki Team member on 04-28-2013, 2:00 PM (14:00) Yes, I saved the date and time..  I then branched out into the News Team becoming the Music News writer. I left at the beginning of the school year and got accepted a few days before the new year. (2014) So you wanna know my future plans? Well, there's three impossible things I'd like to achieve. First, I'd LOVE to join the group Infamous. Jeez, I know you, Saturday, Clique, and Cloudy know how much I've wanted to go. It's been my dream group since last year. I remember getting a PM from Remorsal a last year and I thought I was getting an invite, but he was just asking for what I had to offer. I tried to explain what I had to offer, but I guess I didn't impress the leaders. Back when ShadowCloud was a leader, I applied to both Infamous recruitment threads. Didn't get in. Guess I'm not Infamous material. Oh well, I still look up to everyone in that group. Second, I'd love to become a staff or mentor. Sadly, like my mate Saturday told me: \"I get too emotional\" and I know that would impact how I dealed with stuff. Last, but not least, I'd love to become a leader of a group, but seeing that I'm only in the Writ3rs, nah, I don't see that.\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Shoot for the stars and hope for the best. Do ya' think that HF has impacted you in a positive way?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes. I've met people who I truly love. All of my friends are like family and I feel comfortable telling them stuff I normally wouldn't tell others. I've learned a few life lessons as well.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's kickass, man. Do you think that you'll still be on HF in the next few years? (I hope so!)\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] I think so. There's no reason for me to leave. I'm excited to see what Omni has to offer the community in the future.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's great, man. Anything you'd like to say before we're officially done with this interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]:[/b][/color] clique does your parents know you go on hf\n\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726]Spyro The Dragon[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 182nd edition of the almighty HF News. How's it hanging, Spyro? Any shoutouts before we start?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Things are going pretty swell on my end, thanks. How about you? I'd like to shoutout InfamousSheep. He's a talented guy when it comes to GFX.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm good, thanks. So might as well get this one out of the way early. How'd you find yourself on Hackforums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Good to hear. Well, I remember having a few friends over for a gaming marathon, but we were hit with a problem. We had three Xbox's, and not a single one had Live. One of my friends suggested searching on the internet for some codes, and after a few searches, I stumbled upon Hackforums. I managed to get my hands on some codes, and I liked the community. They were friendly with me, even though I had less than 50 posts at the time. I began to spend more and more time browsing the forums, and it got me to where I am today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's a tad different than most people who came searching for booters on here. Anyway, why the name 'Spyro The Dragon' exactly?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Originally, my name on Hackforums was Jason1337Bourne, because we were watching The Bourne Supremacy at the time. I couldn't wait to get L33T, because over time, I grew to hate the name. After my upgrade, I went through a variety of names, however I soon settled on Spyro The Dragon. I remember choosing it, as I had gotten my PS1 out of the attic, and I was having a 'retro games' night. I wanted the name 'Spyro', however the name is already in use on a closed account. I settled for the next best thing, and I have no intentions on changing it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well you certainly seem to be an avid gamer. I assume you play Hackercraft too?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed I am! Well, I went through a phase about a month ago, where I found myself playing Hackercraft for hours upon hours. I had my eyes on the award, and nothing was going to stop me, well, apart from Omni resetting the economy when I was 10k off the award. I eventually managed to get enough EM to buy the award, and then I decided to quit as I had important exams coming up at school. I like the fact that he's added a new award, however I don't see myself getting back into the Hackercraft scene any time soon.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's a shame. Moving on, you're a newer member to the forum. Almost a year. What are some future goals you have site wise.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] My first goal without a shadow of a doubt is to reach 1000 rep by mid-year. I'm starting to look for groups to join, so that would be another goal of mine.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Looks like you're pretty close to that goal. I'd recommend Instinct if you're a gamer. Plus you already know the Package joke so you're one step closer. So tell us about yourself. Who are you behind the screen? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I'd love to be a part of instinct, however I don't think I have the money to join. Ah, yes, the infamous Package joke. I've spent many hours in the teamspeak, and I have gotten to know lots of members, it would be great if I were to get in to their group one day! \nWell, my name is George and I live in Birmingham, England. I'm 16 years old and I am currently studying for my GCSE exams in the summer. I'm crazy about IT and Business, and I hope to work with computers when I am older. As you already know, gaming is a big part of my life. I remember when my Dad bought me an N64 as a child, it was brilliant. Contrary to popular belief, I do have somewhat of a social life and I play some sorts, although not many.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Seems like a lot of people are interested in IT work when they're older, which makes sense. This is HF after all. So do you read the HF news frequently? If so, do you have anything to suggest to better our work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, that's true, which is a shame. I will have a lot of competition when applying for a job. I started reading the news around mid-september if I remember correctly, and I have read every edition since. I have two suggestions on my mind, although I doubt they will be implemented. \nMy first suggestion would be to add more than one server to the 'Minecraft server of the week' section, perhaps even 3/5. I feel like this would be a good addition to the HF news, as some people deserve recognition for their hard work.\nAnother suggestion, albeit small, would be to take someone onboard who will have the responsibility of proof reading the thread before it's made public. I'm only saying this because I have noticed a few spelling errors and MyBB mishaps here and there. Apart from that, I have no further suggestions, keep up the great work! Your hard work and dedication is truly astounding.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] We actually do have a proofreader. It used to be D3xus and he was great. After him there have been three or so? They're just getting used to it, but I agree completely. So totally off topic question. Favorite music genre?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I'm a huge fan of house music. Although I love songs from all genres. Drumstep is up there on the list of my favourites! What about you, Saturday?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I enjoy house as well, but my favorite genre is Hip Hop/Rap I'd say. You really couldn't pin point my favorite gene as it changes so frequently. I'm on a weird rock phase right now. But one last question; You awake in a cold dark cellar. There's no light anywhere and you're naked. You're feeling your way around and you touch a cold object. Upon rubbing your hand down it you realize it's a human body. Suddenly something from behind grabs you and holds your mouth closed. You pass out and awake in your house in your bed as if it never happened. What would you do next?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Well, this sure escalated quickly. Well, it all depends on whether it was a female body or a male body. If it was female, I would (without any doubt) have morning glory. Due to this, the first thing on my agenda would be to have a morning fap. Afterwards, I would spend a good 30 minutes sitting in the shower with the water dripping on my head, contemplating what just happened to me. What about you?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, way to flip the tables on me. I don't know how to answer that, that's why I asked you. What was your question you were going to ask me?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] If you could meet any member on Hackforums, besides Omni, who would you meet and why?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Wait, why are you doing the interviewing. You're breaking all the rules. But I'd say [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=837416]Soulmate[/url] or [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451]Yellows[/url]. I was supposed to meet Soulmate last year or so. We were both in the same airport and he was supposed to come to my terminal but he took too long in security ad I almost missed my plane and had to leave without saying hi. As for Yellows, that's been my bud for about two years or so now. How about you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I thought it'd be nice for you to answer some questions for a change, asking people questions all the time must get boring! Yellows is a great member in my opinion. It's a shame that you didn't get to meet him! I would meet [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1914835]Joe Pesci[/url]. He lives in Boston, and we've been friends for almost 6 years. He was my first internet friend, and I hope to meet him one day! He's helped me through tough times, and he's a really great guy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Six years?! That's crazy. But I think we may have overdone this interview. Time for me to go. Anything else you want to add before I end this bad boy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Yes it is! Hey, overdoing something is better than under-doing something I think! I'd like to say thanks for taking your time to interview me, I hope it wasn't too boring for you![/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608]ShadowCloud[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to the 182nd edition of the HF News, today we're joined by MOTM winner, ShadowCloud. How are ya doing Shadow? Any shotouts you'd like to make before we dive into this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] Hey, thanks for taking the time to interview me.  There are so many I'd like to give shoutouts to and I do fear forgetting someone, so I'll stick to the closest ones, bugga, iNviZ and of course Viral Dragon\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, and no problem. Lets start by addressing that MOTM award. Which month of which year did you win that and for which reasons?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] Uhm, that was July 2012. I had actually been in the nominations for a couple of months before finally winning.  Most of my contributions to HF are actually in the group subforums.  There are a couple of pretty decent threads around the forum, but I tend to post a lot more helping people out than asking questions.  At that point I had written a number of tutorials, so I'd like to think that's why people chose to vote for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Cool, what kind of content did your tutorials include?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] I covered a number of subjects mostly coding and hacking related though.  We did a really extensive SQLi tutorial as part of an Infamous group project.  On top of that me and Viral created a hacking helpdesk as well as a thread debunking some popular hacking hacking myths which was actually a lot of fun to do\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] It's extremely sad to hear about Viral and what he's going through right now. Do you two still communicate regularly? Anything you'd like to say to him right now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] Absolutely, there's a lot of things I'd like to say to him right now.  If you don't mind, I'd like to keep that between me and Viral though.  It's not my place to discuss another member. The one thing I will say, is that I wish them all the best during a difficult time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Of course. Moving on, since your registration, what kind of things have you learned from HF? Any specific ares of computing for example?\nNot really, I mean I've picked up a couple of things here and there, but there hasn't been a lot of really advanced topics in the areas that interest me and I joined HF after already starting a career in the IT security field, so a lot of the \"new\" things I see here, I've already seen while analyzing attacks.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Got ya, so what do you do for a living. assuming you don't mind sharing that information.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] Not at all, as I mentioned I started in the IT security field, but then shifted over to development, so currently I'm a C# developer.  I mostly work on Enterprise systems.  My real passion remains in web security, however, the job market here is a lot easier for developers and I do have a household to maintain.  I had a big break after hacking the police on national television and that's opened the stage to me talking as a guest speaker at a couple of conventions.  Nothing that would make me famous, but still better than nothing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's crazy! did you get in any legal trouble?\nNot at all.  I'm still a little surprised that they never pursued it, as I take it they know exactly who and where I am.  Then again IT law isn't quite where it should be here in Africa.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Why don't don't you tell us more about what it's like living in Africa? Any misconceptions  you'd like to clear up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] Well, I live in one of the better, if not the best country in Africa in terms of infrastructure.  So this isn't much different to being in a small town in the UK.  (And I can safely say that since I've lived there as well)  So we don't ride to work on elephants or hunt lions with our bare hands for fun.  I guess I've heard some pretty interesting stories from other people.  That being said, there are some countries here where things are absolutely crazy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahahaha yeah some of the stories are just crazy. What's your favourite thing about HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] Finding \"a diamond in the rough\" as someone has so eloquently put it to me recently.  HF has it's fair share of trolls, flamers, idiots and power hungry deluded fools, but every now and then, you find someone who is more than just a profile, someone who is a genuine person.  It's decent conversations with good people that keep me on this forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] True that Shadow, true that. I'd like to thank for this interview, if you have any closing statements you'd like to make before we wrap this up, feel free to do so.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=272608][b]ShadowCloud:[/b][/url] I think above all I'd like to take a second to thank the unsong heroes of HF.  The guys who take a section and really contribute massive amounts to them without any reward or recognition.  The guys who do it purely to contribute rather than hunt for reputation or awards, you guys rock.\n[/spoiler]",

For the last few days, the beta was only open to gamers with a beta code; however, Respawn has decided to open up the beta to the public, so they can stress test their servers for the game launch in March. \"Let's break it,\" Zampella said, \"The plan is to make the beta fully open and have you max stress it!\" Respawn also stated that they may do the same for the PC beta in a few days. \"To download the beta, sign in to your Xbox One and check the 'New Game Demos' section of the Game Store. It should appear there. For further instructions on how to get the beta on Xbox One, head over to Major Nelson's blog.\" \"I have an evil grin on my face right now,\" Zampella said. \"Is that normal?\" Titanfall launches on March 11 in North America, and March 13 in Europe and Australia.\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox One February Update[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft has released another console update that improves the dashboard in many ways. Major Nelson has stated that the update brings back the battery indicator and the ability to view storage space. By now you should have gotten the update, and should have seen said features. Another major addition to the update was the ability to use USB keyboards for the console. You can view the full list of new updates and improvements below.\n[spoiler=List][list]\n[*]Ability to delete game and application save data\n[*]Improved installation and DLC management\n[*]Improved UI for accessing friends, achievements, messages, and party chat\n[*]Game DVR app to be included in the Xbox OneGuide as an app channel\n[*]Update to the boot progress indicators for system update\n[*]Improve consistency of UX for update & install progress\n[*]Separate game, application, and install queue lists\n[*]Addition of USB keyboard support\n[*]Improved NAT detection\n[*]Network Troubleshooter improvements\n[*]Blu-ray quality improvements\n[*]Significant performance and stability improvements\n[/list][/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][b]DayZ: Possible Xbox One and PS4 Releases[/b][/color]\nDean Hall, DayZ creator, says that he is open to the idea of releasing the game to Xbox One and PS4 consoles; however, he also stated that he is not ready to commit to it yet. \"We'd certainly consider release on any feasible platform with a realistic publishing model,\" Hall told GameReactor. \"It seems like currently both of the next-gen consoles should provide an environment we can develop inside.\" Hall has already spoken to Microsoft about bringing the game to Xbox One, but he has not had the same chance with Sony. \"I've not personally had the opportunity to view the full details of the PS4,\" he said. \"The next-gen consoles show very exciting promise. I'm hopeful that they can deliver on that. An important part of that, from my perspective, is encouraging and supporting third-party creative development to bring the 'edginess' of PC creative development into the console,\" Hall said. \"I think if the role of Kinect/voice expands to where it is desired it could do some awesome things. I just think it's too early to say at this point.\" Unfortunately, we likely won't see the game on consoles this year, but it remains a possibility. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThe video of the week was created by TotalBiscuit, where he talks about the much anticipated game, Titanfall. \n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9uuQ3T69E[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbb0ATvLAZvxfB.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot 14w07a[/color][/b]\nIn yet another progression to Minecraft 1.8, another snapshot has been released with fixes, additions, and updates. While not many changes have been made or added to the survival gamemode, the game keeps getting better from a mapmaker's perspective. Not only are command blocks gaining plenty of new syntax, but the adventure and spectator gamemodes' functions continue to grow. Additionally, the only tangible addition to survival mode in this snapshot has been the iron trapdoor; it works similar to that of how the iron door works compared to the wood one.\n\n[b][color=white]Hints Towards TU14 for Minecraft 360[/color][/b]\nAfter recognizing [url=https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/431781284726472704]a Tweet made by 4JStudios[/url], Minecraft 360's developer, one can make the assumption that there will be plenty of additions to Minecraft TU14 on the Xbox 360. What fair would it be, then, if there was no update to the Playstation 3 version? That being said, console changes (for all consoles, that is) can be expected for release very shortly. As noticed from the past, most updates for consoles will likely add tons of features to further make the game similar to that of its PC version.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nDue to there being so many recipients of the HackerCraft award, another one has been made. Obtained the same way as the first one, \"HackerCraft Purple\" has been implemented and costs 100k EM. Similar to the first one, then, only Pow3r users can obtain the award. Get farming, HackerCrafters.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]HackerCraft[/color][/b]\nMaking its day-view in the Minecraft news yet again, HackerCraft is ready to be played actively again with the new addition of \"HackerCraft Purple.\" Surely, many more people will be on striving to gain the new award in the riveting farming economy and awesome environment shared by other HackForums members.

During the political rallies, three people were reported killed in the act. Although the president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, banned protests; the bans have done more harm than good. The president has sent out government officials to calm everyone and get the word out that you cannot protest toward him. \"This is not Ukraine,\" Maduro said, indicating that the people shouldn't protest against him as he'll most likely never change his ways. The people hope that legal changes will be made, one change being Maduro's resignation.\n\n[color=white][b]The Lone Ranger[/b][/color]\nMichael Christian Martinez, currently the only figure skater from the Philippines, finally has his shot in the limelight. As his friends and family cheer for him at home, they hope that he can finally bring the first gold medal for the Philippines back with him. Although there's no snow in the country he's representing, this doesn't stop this teenager. He has qualified among the other 24 top skaters. Before arriving, he has been training for the past two months hoping that he can reign supreme. With support from others, they are hoping that Michael can participate in the next Winter Olympics, as well. At a young age, he was fascinated with skating. He has loved it ever since. By age twelve, he had started participating in competitions, and his rise to fame started. Good luck, Michael!\n\n[color=white][b]Derek Jeter's Final Season[/b][/color]\nDerek Jeter has recently posted on Facebook saying that this will be his last year on the Yankees; in fact, his final year in the MLB entirely. He's well-known among most people and it's sad to see him go. Back in 2013, he had a tough time playing after recovering from his injuries. He pulled through, but the white flag is finally being waved. In an important talk with family and friends; there was discussion of his future, and made sure he actually wanted to follow through with this. They wanted to make sure to only retire if he was 100% sure he was making the right decision. Entering his final season, he has achieved over a whopping 3,000 hits. In 1996, he was the American League Rookie of the Year. Outstanding for him, as well as the Yankees; winning the World Series, Jeter being a major contribution to their success. His last game at Yankee Stadium will be on September 25th. Last, but not least; his final game in the MLB will be on September 28th at Fenway Park. He has definitely been an icon for some, and as said earlier, it's sad to see him go. Farewell, buddy. \n\n[color=white][b]Silk Road 2 Hacked[/b][/color]\nHackers have completely cleaned out the wiped out the entire Bitcoin wallet belonging to the website known as \"Silk Road\". For those who do not know, Silk Road is an underground black market. he only accepted currently on the website is Bitcoin. The hackers made off with 4474.27 Bitcoins, which is equivalent to around $2.7 million USD. Some believe that the original founder of SR had connections with the founder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin prices are currently dropping as we speak and supposedly the hack is a primary reason behind the price drop. SR had an escrow service which they used to send and receive the virtual currency. With a transaction malleability bug around, it allows people to mask the transaction ID. That being said, it continually requests deposit of more Bitcoins. \"Defcon\", the current administrator, stated that six users have been working together to exploit this bug. With good teamwork, they were successful. Quotes taken from Defcon's blog show: “I should have taken MtGox and Bitstamp’s lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported, I was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand.” Defcon has posted all of the transaction logs showing the information of coins stating: “use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice.” Would you give the coins back if you had stolen millions? Defcon attempted (and may still be attempting) to pursue the hackers, in order to retrieve what was stolen.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jTIISqnQV7AMM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Flappy Bird-- Out of Flight?[/color][/b]\nAfter making an easy $50,000 a day in revenue from ads, Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen has made a decision of taking the game down from the Apple App Store and Android Play Market. After posting [url=http://i.imgur.com/7CkFzie.png]a series of Tweets[/url], he's made it very clear that the game is off the market and therefore will satisfy no future updates. If one has the game downloaded on their phone, it won't be removed and can be re-downloaded via cloud storage if deleted, but that's about it. More of his indie games are being released frequently.\n\n[b][color=white]Kickstarter Hacked![/color][/b]\nOn the 12th of February, law enforcement officials had alerted Kickstarter executives of a breach into their website. While doing so, they had mentioned the compromise of user data; including, but not limited to: usernames, e-mails, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and passwords. The site, in defense, had claimed that there is no further evidence that there was any compromise of user credit card data in the process. The site furthermore recommends/advises that all users change their passwords for safety.\n\n[b][color=white]Happy Valentines Day-- from Mars?[/color][/b]\nIn attempt to spread the love on Valentines Day, NASA shared [url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05296]a collection of photos[/url] collected over the last three Mars years exactly ten Earth years ago. These pictures, as seen, are collectively shaped as hearts; obviously very relevant to the holiday. NASA shared the aforementioned in 2004; however, it's always nice to recollect and spread the love on such a holiday. Happy Valentines Day, HackForums Tech News readers; spend it with loved ones, or on HackForums!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j2bNJXw7KAGGS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Pro Era – Secc$ Tape Vol. 2[/color][/b]\nPro Era came out with another sick mixtape, dubbed [i]The Secc$ Tape Vol. 2[/i]. Sick vintage, mellow beats with godly lyricism. After releasing new music all week, Brooklyn's Pro Era caps off an exciting seven days with the release of a new compilation mixtape. Though many appreciate this new mixtape, others are upset because it is simply a compilation. \n\n[b][color=white]Lil Wayne's Tha Carter V Gets A Release Date.[/color] [/b]\nSnooze. The only people that really listen to Wayne still are white people and middle schoolers. Wayne loves to make multiple sequels of his albums, but nothing will compare to the Carter 3. According to Drake, it will be released on May 5, 2014. Another quickly-put-together album by Wayne. Weezy has stated this will be his last album (according to MTV). Thank God.\n\n[b][color=white]Drake Whines Because He Didn't Get Rolling Stones Cover[/color][/b]\nInstead the great Philip Seymour Hoffman got it... and he's dead, by the way. Drake went on a massive, bitchy rant on how he deserved it and RS responded by basically saying \"shut the fuck up, we warned you\". Rolling Stones had stated that they had warned Drake ahead of time that he would not be getting it, and instead will pay their respects to the legendary actor.\n\n[b][color=white]Music of the Week[/color][/b]\n[spoiler=]\nCam'ron(a.k.a Kill Cam) is back with a new track off his upcoming EP, \"Federal Reserve\".\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w_QbqS9BLY[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jT4JzXVrxHH7U.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n-=-=-\nThinking. All ideas can be time consuming to develop, but enabling your own innovation is first step to succeeding as an individual. The easiest way to get ahead is to simply think: develop an idea, research possibilities, adjust plans. If you can find where you can succeed, you can then do.
