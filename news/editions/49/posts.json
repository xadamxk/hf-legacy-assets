Let's get started; first off this week [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] came down hard on all the repfucked users whining in their posts, threads, and profiles. He simply responded by implementing a new rule which states, \"If you get repfucked and complain in the forums such as your profile or in a post you will receive a month ban.\" To check out the whole story, click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1447558]here[/url].\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has also addressed an issue this week where it has become apparent that groups are being used to coordinate gang-repping. Read more about this issue [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1437921]here[/url].\r\n\nOur administrator, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], took a well-deserved one day vacation this week to recuperate. Read his thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1442458]here[/url].\r\n\nAnother new rule that has been added by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] regarding the Hack Forums warez policy is the banning of all torrents, movie downloads and links plus links to illegal online movie sites. To read the original thread click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1450743]here[/url].\r\n\nIn other news, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671][color=#AAAAFF][b]panDa.[/b][/color][/url] is now the new moderator of the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=158]Graphics Requests Section[/url]. We wish him the best of luck at his new position.\r\n\nSpeaking of moderators, you can now, once again, see the label that states who is moderating the section. It looks like [url=http://gyazo.com/4e314f987af6a31f2f3db2b2182aad75.png]this[/url].\r\n\nIn group news, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=204984][color=white][b]Buzz Lightyear[/b][/color][/url] is now the new owner of Graphic Masters. He has also promoted [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=32695][color=white][b]Etheryte[/b][/color][/url] as a leader.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][color=lime][b]xerotic[/b][/color][/url] left every group he was affiliated with this week. This includes Reverence, the group he led for a short time.\r\n\nThe group [b]Techsperts[/b] closed their recruitment in order to review applications and accept or deny members.[/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNUsernews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[align=justify][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#FFCC00][b]DΣxus[/b][/color][/url] has posted a thread about the release of a program to jailbreak an iPad 2, if you would like to read further, click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1439497]here[/url].\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=137645][color=#0066FF][b]-mothered-[/b][/color][/url] was unbanned this week but has yet to return.

The video caught [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s eye, and he unbanned him for now. The video and official statement can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1431984]here[/url].\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712][color=white][b]Cobalt+[/b][/color][/url] has bought the first sticky in Graphic Services.

This record was broken in Phoenix. What makes the record-breaking heat worse is that about 4,000 homes are without power, and more importantly, air conditioning. Even stranger, the County Sheriff in Phoenix ordered thousands of bags of ice for the county's indoor jail. Inmates can have as much as they want and for whatever use.\r\n\nFor the second time in 6 years, the Minnesotan government had to shut down. This was caused because the state could not \"... bridge the gap between our differences over more complicated areas of the budget.\" While many republicans tried to avoid a government shutdown at all means possible by making a temporary funding bill, it ultimately failed and the government shut down. The government will hopefully be up and running again and the funding bill sorted out.\r\n\nIn a tragic case of medical marvel, a baby boy was born without skin. When he was born his mother said it looked as if he had third degree burns. The cause of this mystery is that the boy has a rare form of epidermolysis bullosa. Each day is tragic for this young boy as he has to be wrapped in bandages to keep infectious activity down. Even more saddening news, there is no treatment for this horrible disease.[/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNInterviews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 1 - Master Meanbean[/color][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmki5LEETtA[/yt][/spoiler]\r\n\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 2 - Baked[/color][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler][align=justify][color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Hello, Baked, and thank you for this interview. First thing I would like to ask, what made you join Hack Forums?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] I wanted to hack people's Piczo websites and Habbo accounts, I was so 1337. Searched for hacking and found Hack Forums, never looked for another site.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Nice, what did you think of the quality and material then?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] It was mostly the same thing, just not as abundant. Lots of kids just asking for stuff, L33T was the only upgrade, mind you this was in 2008-2009. A few coders that I missed from those days, for example Albertino shone in those days.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Compared to back then, how is the quality and general atmosphere of the forum?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] I wasn't as active back then, so I can't really be a judge. I came on here to get keyloggers and learn new hacks, nothing more. The tutorials and helping were a lot more direct as there was less members. Overall same atmosphere, just not as large.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] So you are not exactly a new member, do you think you have the \"oldfag\" attitude?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] Not exactly, my account was inactive for at least 9 months and I wasn't active until last August.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Ah, well I see your registration name is different from your current name. What made you change your name, and how did you choose each one?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] I've changed my name 4 times I think. First was condie99 (my last name) INB4 I get doxed. Second was \"Scylla\" with a weird character, it is a mythological creature or if you've watched the show Prison Break, it's a high-tech encryption system. Third was \"Sunny Side.\" I was thinking of names and changed to Baked like 10 minutes after. Baked is my heritage now.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Well excellent, now on to some more personal questions. Which do you prefer, The Simpsons of Family Guy?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] Neither, I'm a South Park kind of guy. 😎\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Awesome! How old were you when you first kissed a girl?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] In eighth grade, so I was 13.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Since then, have you maintained steady relationships, or rocky one night stands?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] I'm more of a casual dater, if the girl wants to date. Sure. But if not, I won't ask.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, so in relation to your HF username, do you enjoy baking? What are your favorite foods?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] Favorite food is fettuccine chicken Alfredo, cookies (chocolate) and raspberry pie with ice cream. I always don't mind them hash brownies, ya'dig.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Awesome, seems like you enjoy those dessert foods! Anyway, when you look in a mirror, do you like what you see?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] Yeah for sure, it could be better. But I like it.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, confidence is key! If you like yourself, others will too. Most of the time. Anyway, back to HF. I hear you are going to be releasing some products on HF soon. Is this true?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] You heard right, I have one product on the market already (shout outs to Emily), [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1452211]xBooter[/url]. Next product that is coming out is called \"Cryptex\", coded completely in C# (shout outs to KillaMuvz). It is FUD and has amazing features. Going to be great. In the next while I will be releasing a FUD C++ crypter named \"Kryptonite.\" Keep your eyes in the Marketplace if you're interested.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright folks, you heard him! A few great products will be hitting the market soon! Are you looking forward to the release and the constant support you may need to provide?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] Yes, I'm really looking forward to becoming a big \"hustler\" in the Marketplace. I will be hiring a team, keep your eyes open in Marketplace Discussions. I've got another idea for a product that might release mid August, more details will be released later on. It's going to revolutionize keylogging and stealing.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Awesome, we will be looking forward to it. Until then, would you like to give a few shout outs before we wrap this up?\r\n[color=white][b]Baked:[/b][/color] Shout outs to Zach, Mike., and Thoth. Thanks for interviewing me xero, makes me feel all squishy about myself.  \r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Haha, thanks for the interview, Baked, hope you have a good one.[/align][/spoiler]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNClassifieds.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[align=right][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1416451][img]http://i.imgur.com/DlCXk.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=left][url=http://www.mskeys.in][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/X3GG1.jpg[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNTeam.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[color=white][b]Publisher & Head Writer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848]Qwazz[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Publisher's Assistant[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033]xerotic[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Writers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712]Cobalt[/url][list]\r\n[*]Other News[/list]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=153686]Fireren[/url][list]\r\n[*]Headlines[/list]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url][list]\r\n[*]User News[/list][/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Reporters[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453]ReactioNz[/url][list]\r\n[*]Head Reporter[/list]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=129444]3x0r_$c0rPi0n[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]chocothunda[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=126243]Decoy[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=168826]Tyler777[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=200751]Zach[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=115612]-BoodyE-[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=137080]Boxing[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=92059]Aptitude[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Editors[/b] [/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=70881]Paradoxum[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=234024]Deities[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Graphic Designer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671]panDa.[/url][/list]",
