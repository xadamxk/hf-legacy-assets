Shortly after, as in today November 21st, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] released the official HF IM XMPP. Though he still considers it to be in the beta stages, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made it open for Ep1c + Ub3r only, meaning you must be both Ep1c and Ub3r to be able to use it. As of right now tutorials are being written and the Mentors that have already been using this for the past two days can answer any questions you might have. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#EFEFEF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url] has already done a great job at creating a detailed, full guide for the XMPP which can be found, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4547989]here[/url]. Also adding to the new Verify Secret feature [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] implemented, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Snorlax[/b][/color][/url] has made a new userscript that allows you to get the Verify token straight from the users profile instead of going through the other steps. The Verify token will then copy directly to your clipboard.

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] wants to redo the blocks and firewalls in the next week or two, as it is part of his overhaul he has been planning. Most of the countries currently on the block list will be removed, excluding Brazil, China, and Russia. The reason some of these countries are blocked is because of large botnets or lack of communication, according to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] interview [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4543694]here[/url]. The datacenters will not be undone or reblocked, as it protects the site from ban evaders and scammers using VPN's or proxies. With the new implementation of the upgrade systems, some countries might be forced to use BTC only to prevent charge backs or other issues. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has also asked members to request countries to be unblocked, as friends could be trying to get on the site. You can read more about the unblocks on [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4543650]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]MOTM November Nominations Now Open[/b][/color]\nThe nomination phase for November's Member of the Month competition is now open, and closes on Sunday, November 30th, 2014.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the warm welcome :) Yeah, I'd like to give a shout-out to bugga, Tony Stark, zSerity, Vinnie and Autocorrect.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] An interesting mix, how did you get to know these people?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Mainly just PM'ing them and through Skype, that's how I meet most my friends. I find HF a good way to socialize with a mix of different people. I am actually on a call with a few HF members right now, always good fun.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So Zero has been for sale for a while and rumor has it that Syrah is going to turn the group into Whisper, how do you feel about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] I always love group changes on HF, gives a chance for new people to join and increases overall group diversity. Been talking to Maximum about it a little bit. Sounds like it's gonna be a good change!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I don't want to be too nosy, but can you give us any insight on what the group will become? Will the current members remain in the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Don't really want to leak information regarding the group without permission, so yeah. In regards to if current members are staying, I am unsure. I haven't been given a definite answer as of yet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I completely understand, was hoping maybe I could get something out of you though. So tell me how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] I initially signed up like anyone to \"learn how to hack\", however I soon learned that the forum is not about that primarily. So therefore I started to move onto other sections, mainly the lounge.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So what do you do outside of the forum? Where are from?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] I don't do much outside the forum besides school,Skype, gaming and a little bit of Photoshop here and there, nothing too exciting. I currently live in Australia, hence why I included bugga, Autocorrect and Tony Stark, as they too are from Australia.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I noticed that you were in Instinct, now rebranded Nightfall. Can you give the readers any insight why that change was made?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Vinnie had wanted a change for a while now (he spoke about it in the SF and over TS), he wanted it to be a bit more community based (last time I spoke to him), but now I am not exactly sure of the direction Nightfall will take. Especially with the new Leadership of Nobility. I do know that Nightfall will still be gaming based, and the subforum is now a lot more organised, we'll just have to wait and see what changes are going to happen!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] The graphics strike a slight similarity to the late Fly By Night, what do you think of them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Although there are similarities with FBN graphics wise, I do believe that the graphics are quite extraordinary. I really quite like them and they fit the group perfectly. I liked a lot of the other entries as well, but I guess it's the community as a whole (Nightfall) that choose which one represents our group the best.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So being a gamer what do you play? Any titles you're looking forward to coming out?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] I mainly play PS3, haven't really moved onto Xbox yet, but do intend to buy an Xbox One (much to my friends dismay). I used to play a lot of Minecraft, but my computer's fairly bad so it's a bit laggy sometimes. I intend to buy a new custom built computer within the next few weeks, that way I can hopefully start playing other games. I was really looking forward to Grand Theft Auto V on nextgen (however, it's already out now) but unfortunately I don't have a PS4 or Xbox One, so hopefully that'll change in the future. Oh, also my main reason for wanting an Xbox One > PS4 is that Forza Motorsport is on Xbox One. Which is from what I've seen, amazing and also one of my favorite games on the original Xbox.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I've been addicted to CSGO lately, so much fun. So how do you feel about the new XMPP introduction?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, sounds like good fun man, might buy it when I get my new computer. I feel that the new XMPP addition to HF, will help reduce the amount of fake scam reports out there, and help with the legitimacy of deals. I really love the addition, however I'll still probably primarily use my private XMPP account. I have in fact made an account for HF though through the new system.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So if you could change one thing about Hack Forums what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] Hmm, not much to be honest. I would really like to maybe see some moderation in the scam report section, to help with the resolving of them. For example: adding in a moderator within the section, who can decide whether a scam report is legitimate or not, and then issue a punishment of some sort. This would help reduce scammers who continue to scam. I feel that someone who is scammed $10.00 is just as important as someone who is scammed $300.00, so hence why I think a moderator of some sort should be in that section. Other than that, Omniscient does an excellent job of running HF, and it's ultimately up to him what he implements, changes and doesn't implement into HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree, I wish that some action was take. How would you rate your overall Hack Forums experience on a scale on 1-10?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] I would rate HackForums overall around an 8 or a 9, mainly due to the fact most people I have interacted with here on HF have been quite nice towards me. Also due to the fact that the experience of learning new things here on HF has been invaluable, as well as the laughs I have gotten in the group subforums and Lounge section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well I think that's all the time we have today. Do you have any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1668068][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Virtue:[/b][/color][/url] No, not really.

This time we have Grievous with us. What's up man?\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color] Thank you for interviewing me today, I appreciate it. Nothing much has happened today besides school but luckily it is now Thanksgiving break so I'll be highly active for the next week. How about you Clique?\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'm doing just fine man. Anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, that's a tough one. I guess I'll start off with how I came to hackforums. It all started when my brother, _DeNy was selling a tool called QuikHop for Source games on Steam. I came around that time and started to become highly inactive.\n    It came to a point where I decided to come back to hackforums with the name Essence, my idea was to learn how to do the same as my brother did. Sadly, that never happened as I didn't have the motivation to do sit there for hours trying to learn a new language. I then proceeded onwards to the alias of Grievous. Once I switched my name to Grievous I started to contribute more and more to the community and this has put me into the spot where I am now, an HF Addict.\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Is your brother still on the forums or did he leave when you went inactive?\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color]  My brother was closed by Omniscient. I only have bits and pieces of the story as I rarely talk to him about it due to him always being in a pissy mood to talk to me or just not caring about it enough to talk about it, therefore I won't be saying what I've heard so no one will get in trouble.\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Ah well, anyways. What's your opinions on Nightfall? It used to be instinct actually. Just curious on your thoughts on it.\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color]  I can't say much about Nightfall as it's currently unknown for what will be happening. Seeing as Vinnie has taken a road down trolling lane, I'm sure it'll just be like Instinct again but just a name change to make it be a refreshed market for him to sell spots with. I have to say though, props to him for pulling in such a huge income off a group on a virtual forum.\n    Instinct was fine when it was around, I would still classify Nightfall as Instinct. The only problem I seen with Instinct is the amount of trolling and flaming the members within it caused. I'm not calling out every member, there are/were a ton of members in Instinct that were keeping the group in it's place. Never-the-less, I'd just want to say that I wish you luck with the changes, Vinnie.\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Have any groups that are your favorites on the forum?\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color]  Ooh, that's a good one there Clique.\n    Phoenix is overall, by far, the best and my most favorite group on hackforums. Tibit is an amazing leader himself (secretly he is a noob though.) The other leaders being Troye, Eternal, and iKinky are always very open about themselves and are very kind members, amazing to chat with as well.\n\n    Enterprise is another one, I have my ups and downs with the members that were in the group before I became leader but it's developed into a family-like relationship with them.\n\n    L'appel Du Vide has to be my next as they have amazing members within the group and interesting topics to talk about within the subforum.\n\n    All the other groups don't appeal to me too much or aren't doing much to show themselves.\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Is Hackforums the only board that you're active on? Would you suggest this forum to a friend?\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color] Hackforums is the one and only forum that I'm even contributing to.\n    The forum overall has a great environment. There is a bad side of the community although the good side is what evens it out.\n\n    As for bringing a friend to the forum, I have already brought a few and they've all become inactive.\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  What else do you do besides browsing HF?\n    [color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b][/color]    have an life outside of hackforums (everyone is going to be surprised)\n\n    I play Soccer for both my High School and an outside league. I have been hooked onto soccer ever since I was around 6/7 years of age. On weekends I'm usually out with friends playing soccer for a good 1-2 hours in the morning. I also have two dogs which I absolutely adore, they're my two favorite things on Earth. When hackforums is down I usually go off and play with them or take them for a walk.\n\n    Other than the things listed above, I attend school and play a variety of games on my computer.\n\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  What's one thing you'd change on HF if you had the power?\n    [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url]:[/b] The thing is, if I even had the power to change something on HF it would be nearly impossible to do so. The community is somewhat cooperative but at the way I see it they don't take anyone who can't ban them seriously.\n    Mentors are harassed or talked about constantly behind their backs.\n\n    The only change I would make is to clear out the junk posts, and to answer/close the useless threads where people reply with the same answer 10 times then takes several hours for a mentor to get on to post and close the thread.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Interesting.

I'd like to give a shout out to a few members. Tibit for being a nooby leader, Programming for being the cool kid on the block, zSerity for the upcoming fruit wars we will have, Eternal for being daddy, Troye and iKinky for being amazing members, Doxicity/.Sinister for being there for me.

In Google's Vulnerability Reward Program, over 70% of the found vulnerabilities are due to XSS flaws. It is a safe environment for vulnerability scanners to examine patterns in web applications that can be exploited. These include several vulnerability types such as DOM-based, redirected, reflected, tag-based, escaped and remote inclusion bugs. The source code for this program can be found on [url=https://github.com/google/firing-range]Git Hub[/url].\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]$30,000 Piracy Punishment Denied for \"Excessive Punishment\"[/color][/b]\r\nInternet Piracy is defined as the unlawful downloading or sharing of copyrighted content and has become increasingly popular, as well as more severely punished, due to is relative simplicity and convenience. A group of home internet users were sued for the piracy of a film and were requested to pay $30,000. Judge Thomas Rice of a Washington Federal Court has determined this amount to be \"excessive punishment\" and that the filmmakers were \"not hurt much\" by the sharing of their film. The copyright laws were meant to discourage digital pirates from downloading illegal content, but since hundreds of thousands of people do it on a regular basis, filmmakers tend to make an example of a select few by charging them an uncanny amount of money. However, this Judicial decision has prevented this excessive punishment for what is, essentially, a victimless crime.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]A New and Free Anti-Surveillance Tool Named Detekt Hits the Net[/color][/b]\r\nHuman rights experts and Privacy International have launch an exciting new and free tool that allows its user to scan their personal computer for surveillance spyware, which is typically used by government officials and other organizations to breach our privacy, and spy on us. The free of charge anti-surveillance tool goes by the name of Detekt. It is an open source software app released by a partnership of Human rights charity Amnesty International, Germany’s Digital Gesellchaft, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and finally Privacy International. Reports are already being made of the tool finding spyware. For example, the Bahraini government has been found to use FinSpy, a surveillance spyware developer by FinFisher. FinSpy has the ability to monitor Skype conversations, take screenshots and photos using the device’s camera, monitor emails, and even record microphone use.

I present to you WireLurker. WireLuker is a new family of malware that specifically targets iOS devices via USB, and is able to penetrate the iPhone. WireLurker has been roaming around China for the past six months. People have been infecting Macs by inserting Trojan malware through repackaged OS X apps, and then proceeding to move onto the iOS devices.  Three people have now been arrested in correlation with these attacks. Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau announced the arrest of three people in China with connection to the WireLurker malware. This has brought a sense of relief to Apple users in China. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]PSN, 2K, and Windows Live Hacked?[/color][/b]\r\nThe infamous hacker group that goes by the name of @GabenTheLord has taken to Twitter to claim that they have breached PSN, 2K Game Studios, and Windows Live databases in order to hack several accounts and credit card information. GabenTheLord claims to have obtained a total of 7 million accounts. Up to this point, none of the companies have released a public statement confirming the hack, but it is better to be safe than sorry – we recommend you change your password if you are associated with any of these services.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1339278]Paragon[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Hidden US technology intercepts cellular communications[/color][/b]\r\nA new report reveals that fake cell phone signal receivers in airports gather cellphone traffic in a secret government program. The way that it works is all cellphone traffic is sent through a specialized box attached to an airplane flying overhead. That box is designed to trick mobile phones into communicating with it, allowing all sorts of information to travel through the air and into the device. This program is just one of many United States government surveillance programs that have been scrutinized in the past years. The initiative has been in existence since 2007 and operates out of at least five metropolitan airports that's enough to cover most of the US, according to the report.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Russian Hackers Spying on Webcams Worldwide[/color][/b]\r\nThe United Kingdom's privacy watchdog called on Russia to take down a site showing hacked live feeds from thousands of homes and businesses around the globe. The hackers were taking advantage of devices like CCTV cameras and remote access baby monitors without any security protection, they are also targeting anything with weak passwords. The website, accesses the information by using the default login credentials, which are freely available online, granting access with minimal effort. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Gmail Begins to Block Suspicious Addresses Containing Non-Latin Characters[/color][/b]\r\nGoogle has updated it's popular email service \"Gmail's\" spam filters to block any emails coming from addresses using suspicious combinations of Latin and non-Latin characters. Hackers can exploit the fact that many non-Latin characters look nearly identical to Latin characters. An example is by using  very similar combinations of Greek and Latin letters, allowing scammers to trick unsuspecting users by mixing and matching characters. In an attempt to correct the issue, Google has updated it's Gmail spam filters to block emails coming from addresses that use combinations identified by the Unicode community as being suspicious and potentially misleading.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white] Master of all Master Passwords[/color][/b]\r\nMore now than ever, cybercriminals have started targeting not your passwords directly, but instead indirectly through password managing programs. Said to start keylogging all keystrokes on the infected computer once certain password management programs are ran, numerous new findings of this type of malware have taken place. Researchers at IBM have found that the attackers have the malware keylog the master password for these management programs, then send the credentials over to a legitimate, but compromised web-server. With estimates that attacks like these will only become more popular, open-source password management applications are looking less and less suitable.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Shatterproof Windows [/color][/b]\r\nWith recent news regarding how insecure Windows is when it comes to cryptography, it’s good to hear that Microsoft is doing their part in getting such vulnerabilities fixed. In this weeks update, Microsoft patched a vulnerability in the “implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol”, and it is said to be actively exploited in the wild. The attackers making targeting servers their number one priority (as usual), Microsoft has sent out a patch to most (if not all) server versions. The official MS Security Bulletin code for the Kerberos vulnerability is MS14-068.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]More and More Breaches (USSD)[/color][/b]\r\nAfter finding some “activity of concern”, the US State Department took down their email system indefinitely, or at least until they can make repairs and upgrades to the system. The email system said to be affected was unclassified, so it is unsure if any classified data was exposed, although the senior department official has stated that no classified data was exposed, this is may not be true however. The relentless attack on numerous government agencies have sparked discussion of espionage, and attackers working for other governments, two of the main suspected governments being Russia and China. It is said that the USSD will talk more about the situation this coming Monday or Tuesday.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Soon to Come: Battlefield 5[/color][/b]\r\nLove blowing up buildings?

Taking place during \"The War of the Five Kings\" just like the TV series, you will play as a character to fight evil doers and various other events that take place. That being said, Telltale has chosen six episodes which the first season of the game will consist of. You will be playing around through the different episodes the game provides, and the first episode that will be available for purchase can be accessed via PC, iOS devices, New Gen consoles (One and PS4) as well as the Playstation 3 and 360. The game has no set date on when it wwill be released, but Telltale shares it will probably be out sometime before the start of next year. If you'd like to see the trailer yourself, you can do so by clicking [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZeJfIvy3Ck]here[/url]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Call of Duty: Heroes Released[/color][/b]\r\nOne of the most famous FPS games out to date has released, yet again, another game, this time for iOS and Android devices. The newest edition to the Call of Duty Series, CoD: Heroes is a free-to-play game, bringing something new to the table. CoD: Heroes is described as a 3D strategy game created by Activision after canceling the FPS iOS version of Call of Duty, which has never been seen before. If you've played the past Call of Duties you will get the chance to re-group and meet the older characters you know and like. For example: Captain Price and Soap MacTavish make a return, as well as a bunch of other soldiers! Fighting to survive, you must create, customize, and protect your base against battles vs. friends or random people online. Looking similar to the popular iOS game, Clash of Clans, Heroes is kind of the same thing, but with militaristic gameplay. Starting off with nothing, you must customize the base to your liking, just like stated above. Things like sentry guns, soldiers to protect the base, and other things can be used to take over bases or protect yours from foes. As time goes on, you can level up characters and even use killstreaks to aid you in the long-run. The game available now and is free to play! You can check it out in the Apple Store or on Android devices.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of November 21, 2014:[/color][/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire - Nintendo 3DS - November 21, 2014\r\n[*]Super Smash Bros. for Wii U - Wii U - November 21, 2014\r\n[*]Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions - PC, Play Station 3, Play Station 4 - November 25, 2014\r\n[*]Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth - Nintendo 3DS - November 25, 2014\r\n[*]Tales from the Borderlands - PC, Play Station 3, Play Station 4, Play Station Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One - November 25, 2014\r\n[*]Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions - Xbox 360, Xbox One - November 26, 2014\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[align=center][sp=Gaming Video of the Week][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPv38wT74OM[/yt][/sp]\r\n[/align]\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/i1QkwoE.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Apple To End Patent Troll Wars[/color][/b]\r\nApple and Rockstar have decided to draw a truce with Google and smartphone manufacturers over patents. In 2011, Apple helped found a patent troll company known as Rockstar, which has cost Apple, and it's court opponents billions of dollars in court fees and lawsuits. The move from Apple is suggested to be in part to their new CEO Tim Cook, who has voiced his opinion several times against patent trolls and the impact they have on innovation. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs said that it would wage \"thermonuclear war\" on Android. He seemingly did everything in his power it seems to hinder Android's progress, but it seems Tim Cook can see the bigger picture; that Apple was losing as well. Maybe this will be the initial step that leads to more innovation from both Apple and Android due to fewer patent lawsuits, or maybe the patent armistice will end in more warfare. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Comcast Starts Trials For Limited Internet Bandwidth Plans[/color][/b]\r\nComcast launched a limited data plan as a test in Tucson, Arizona and Nashville, Tennessee. These plans are just like mobile data plans in practice, and allow up to 300GB of bandwidth per month with a $10 charge per 50GB over the cap. With Comcast being the only option for many internet users, a common fear is that they will start charging for the internet like a utility. Such as it is with water and electricity, you use more and you pay more. If the internet were to be like a utility, it would be a huge slap in the face for those who want net neutrality, which deems internet as a utility if it were passed into law.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Net Neutrality Attacked, FCC To Be Sued[/color][/b]\r\nThe FCC is being attacked from almost all angles by ISPs due to it's strong net neutrality rules it is drafting. It seems the ISPs are more concerned than ever since the net neutrality proposals were supported by United States President Barack Obama on November 10th. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler claims that net neutrality will not be in effect until the end of 2014 due to careful planning so that the proposal does not get dropped in court. He also stated that they were going to get sued. Verizon has already publicly threatened the FCC with a lawsuit if ISPs are subject to Title II service, which would deem the internet a utility. \r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Synthetic Gasoline[/color][/b]\r\nThe idea of a fossil fuel free engine in every car is currently a fantasy. Electric cars have been slowly replacing standard cars, but their expensive price tag has slowed the replacement of gas powered cars across the world. Well, according to a German company called Sunfire water may be a solution. They have discovered a way to make synthetic gasoline. Sunfire made a machine that changed H2O and carbon dioxide into a liquid synthetic fuel. There are still some hiccups with their system still, but in the next few years Sunfire expects to have perfected their technology and it would change the oil industry completely.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Google Maps Receives a Face-Lift on Android[/color][/b]\r\nRecently the Google Maps app for Android received a face-lift. For US users, you can now make restaurant reservations in the Google Maps app itself. The new update for Google Maps also included a new modern design and weather information for your destination. Also, Google has added a new way to see how much time an alternate route would save you, and there are new voice commands if you use the app hands-free. Google plans to add more useful features for travelers that can be reacher right from the Google Maps app without having to go anywhere else on your phone.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]3D Interactive Map That Helps The Blind[/color][/b]\r\nIn order to help their blind students safely travel around campus, the Perkins School for the Blind located in Massachusetts has added a 3D talking map. The entire 3D map is 3D printed, and has a unique conductive paint which allows the system to sense it is being touched. Whatever building a person touches, it will tell them what building it is that they touched, and give them directions on how to get there. This is the most technologically advanced interactive map to be installed at a university, and other universities may be adding similar interactive maps in the near future to their campuses.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
