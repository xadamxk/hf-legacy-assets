The month, April, brings its first day, also known as \"April Fools Day\". For the past several years, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has done his best to throw as many members for a loop as possible and this year was a success, judging by the large amount of concerned members making threads within 24 hours on the topic. Upon loading Hack Forums on April 1st, a notification appeared near the top of the screen where PM notifications usually appear, showing the message \"[i]ALERT: We have detected unusual activity with login IPs to your account. Your posting privileges have been suspended until we can verify that your account is not stolen. To have the suspension removed please go to this page: http://hackforums.net/accountrecovery.php. Please be patient as account recovery can take up to 48 hours.[/i]\", including a link that did nothing besides show an endless CloudFlare loading page. If one looked at the title of the page, it showed an April Fool's message that many failed to notice. In addition, line 23 of the page source had the message \"[i]<!--// April Fools Bitches -->[/i]\". Later on in the day, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made a thread sharing his annoyance at the complaints of the April Fool's joke and promptly repfucked everyone, or so it appeared. Finally, a page showing that a person named \"Mii T. CentOS\" had taken over the forum was displayed. On April 2nd, all was returned to normal and members could breathe easy knowing that their hard earned pixels were safe. Several members who became annoyed of the alert box decided it was a good idea to \"beat Omni\" by blocking the section using AdBlock. Those members will now no longer receive PM notifications until they manually undo that change.\n\n[color=white][b]Infamously Complex[/b][/color]\nThis week two well known groups went through major changes, albeit confusing. The mentor [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=619030][color=#EFEFEF][b]iNviZ[/b][/color][/url] sold the group Infamous, an older group originating from the long gone Propitious group. In a statement made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=661940][color=#EFEFEF][b]bugga[/b][/color][/url], she states that iNviZ sold Infamous, but that they had all been a part of it since day one back when it was Propitious. Afterwards, it was decided on Skype that they had had all these years together as friends so they wanted to keep Infamous alive. This caused [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=#EFEFEF][b]Judge Dredd[/b][/color][/url] to change the group Complexity to the new Infamous, keeping not only paid members from Complexity, but a mix of members, both paid and non-paid members. The future will tell what great things will come from this group merger.\n\n[color=white][b]OmniCoin Integration[/b][/color] [img]http://x.hackforums.net/uploads/awards/omc-award.png[/img]\nOmniCoin, Hack Forum's very own crypto-currency, has finally made a comeback as version two was released earlier this week. Within hours of the genesis (first) block being mined, the difficulty had gone up by an exponential amount with members going from several thousand coins per day to several dozen. The price has also been fluctuating a large amount, with members selling OmniCoins for anything from $1.00 each to a more reasonable 10 OMC/$1. Additionally, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has added a new award to the forum known as \"[url=http://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=75][b]OMC[/b][/url]\", a change from the usual naming convention of crypto-awards such as Litecoinage and Bitcoinage. The OMC team is hard at work to provide new features such as cross platform wallets, an exchange, a blockchain viewer, and more. When a JSON API is available, it will most likely be integrated into Hack Forums to show the amount of OMC a particular wallet has.

Syrah has changed the group to Zero; a group of individuals who specialize in marketing. The official thread for the new group can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4147688]here[/url]. Along with Syrah, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1238642]Maximum[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854]CarrotMilk[/url] are leaders of the new group. After controversy with the current userbar of the group, Syrah has opened a thread offering $300 to anyone who makes the best Zero userbar. You can find that thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4151105]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Complexity Rebranded Infamous[/b][/color]\nHours after Infamous was sold, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066]Judge Dredd[/url], a good friend of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=619030]iNviZ[/url]'s, decided to maintain the legacy and rebrand Complexity into Infamous. The group's member base now consists of both Infamous and Complexity members.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] Hello! Yes I would like to give shout outs to Crypto, Aura, Vitani's Mate, Alexander, and everyone in Instinct.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] You are pretty active in Instinct, how has the group impacted your Hack Forums experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] The group has changed my experience here so much. I've gotten to meet new people and have became friends with so many. All of the users in the group have great spirit and activity in the subforum. I use to feel like a lone wolf here, but now I have some people I can talk to about the same things that interest me. Vinnie has also been a great leader, interacting with all of the members and being a goofball with us.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Being active in a gaming group, what games are you into?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] I enjoy playing all types of games. The games I play the most are first person shooters and free roam style games. I've been really into Grand Theft Auto V and have been as active as possible in helping people. As for the first person shooters, I have played hundreds of hours on Call of Duty games and the Battlefield series. I still remember the first Battlefield game just camping out with the .50cal sniper picking people off.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm just going to assume your name is Tom. So tell me Tom what do you do outside of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] I do a few things outside of my Hack Forums career. I am currently a senior in high school and am eagerly looking forward to graduating. Thirteen years of school has been fun, but now I want to explore the world and opportunities ahead of me. I also have a small time local job in my town just doing handy work wherever it is needed. It doesn't pay much, but I enjoy helping the people who call in. I also do volunteer work for my town's first aid squad. I've been a member there for over a year now, and as weird as it might sound, I have loved it. I have seen a lot of crazy stuff go on that either ended in tragedy or in a miracle.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Wow that's pretty cool. You said you wanted to explore, where do you want to go first?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] I really have no idea, haha. I just want to get out and do things. I have a great interest in zoology and biology, so I am hoping to make a career out of that. I am looking into going to California and living with a friend there. I might even try to get a job at the San Diego Zoo if I'm lucky. I have also always wanted to go to Africa and work with the wildlife there. I love the predators of the great Savannah and have always wanted to study them. I hate seeing people use stereotypes on anything they haven't had personal experience with.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm looking into doing similar stuff myself. So tell me, how did you find HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] I found Hack Forums back in 2011 after watching some Minecraft youtube videos. There was a griefing team called Team Avolition that would run around and use hacks to just destroy servers. Being a 14-15 year old kid, I wanted to follow them so I searched for hacked clients. I got my first client from a Youtube video and griefed a server. People were freaking out and I was amazed at the power this thing could do. I eventually signed up here for the Griefing section, which I was very active in for about a year and a half. I joined griefing teams and did client reviews for a bunch of friends. I even helped start \"The Griefing Weekly\" which failed after two editions. I took a three month vacation from HF to experience life and grow up, so when I came back I was bored with the section and Minecraft. Now I just go around helping out wherever I can, it is what I love to do.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] You said you were bored, but do you still play Minecraft at all? There was a huge buzz with people playing Hacker Craft.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] I play from time to time. I'm still an admin on a sever I helped start, so I just fool around there. I usually get bored of it after about an hour or so. I've tried playing Hacker Craft, but I couldn't find a faction to join and wasted all of my money teleporting. Then some kind person decided to kill me so I'm in negative cash right now. Thanks whoever that was.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry to hear that, I think that HC needs so serious help. If you could change one thing about Hack Forums what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] There really isn't much that I would want changed. I guess the reputation system can use a bit of an upgrade in terms of little features. There was a suggestion to add an alert image if someone had a scam report reputation so people could find it better. I really liked this idea and can see how it would help a lot of new members who, sadly, get ripped off and scammed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Last question before we wrap it up here, what are your future Hack Forums goals?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] My future goals for Hack Forums are to help wherever I can and remain active. I came and got what I was looking for, but switching sides to helping people has made my time here worth it. I plan on having a long HF career of just hanging out talking about gaming, relationships, life, and goofy stuff we all see in the lounge.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to interview you. Do you have any concluding remarks or statements you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌:[/b][/color][/url] I would just like to thank you for the opportunity to be interviewed. It has been nice being on this site for so long, and I can't wait to see what it has in store for us for the years to come.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524]bitcube[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News.

Any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Hey, thanks Clark. I'm doing great! I'd like to give a shoutout to Evangelist for pushing me to be active. Though we don't talk much anymore, I still respect him a lot. I'd also like to give a shoutout to bugga for being one of the most friendly people I've ever met.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So why don't you tell us a little bit about how you found HF? What persauded you to sign up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] I joined HF a while ago for the sole purpose of monetization. At the time, I was looking for investors on a \"utility pack\" which was a fancy name I used for the network stressers you see in the market today. Being a normal member, I got exactly zero replies to my threads, so I upgraded. From there on, I started to see HF as a community of friends, especially after joining The Empire and Complexity (now changed to Infamous).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] How are you liking those groups so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Well, I actually joined The Empire twice before. The first time, I was highly inactive and I got kicked. I didn't see much of a purpose in the group before. Now that I've reapplied and gotten in, I've met a ton of great new people. Infamous has been very kind to me so far. I really enjoy the talks we have in there and everyone is extremely friendly and easy to approach. The discussions in both groups are equally appealing, and I'm very greatful to be part of both communities.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I really enjoyed being apart of The Empire too, fantastic group. So do you have any other interests relating to HF that aren't aimed at monetizing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Oh definitely. The Webmaster section had me super excited. I can't believe I missed it for the first year I was online. I absolutely love web design and development; it's one of my favorite things to do. The only problem I see with the subforum for Website Creation is that there's really no engaging discussion on web creation, just people asking for help.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What kind of discussion would you like to see? Between web development and web design which is your favorite and why? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] I'd love to see discussions on different types of website styles, frameworks, user interface models, etc. More on the theoretical/abstract stuff that's cutting-edge and new to website creation, you know? As for web development versus web design, I'd have to go for web design. It's extremely important to provide an engaging experience for your audience. The first thing they see is your website, not your backend work. If you can't keep someone interested, you won't be able to get your point across.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  I got ya, and very true. So do you do any free lance web work? How long have you been designing/developing websites?  \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Yeah, I'm a freelancer. I also get contracted by a small web design company every now and then. I've been doing this for about 8 years, and I think I'll be doing it for a long time to come. I'm always available for website creation!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good to know! So is that your full time occupation? I was actually considering doing something very similar when I get out of college. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Well, I'm still a student, but I manage to make a good living off of what I love to do. College is a pain to pay for though, but I'm doing fine at the moment. There was a point, about two months ago, when I had literally $0 to my name, but I've been doing a lot better now and can live comfortably for the time being. I plan on starting my studies for Law (Intellectual Property) next year and finishing up my CE major.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh good for you. I hear ya, there's nothing fun about being a broke college student. So if I'm not mistaken Intellectual property rights are legal rights to creative expression? what sparked your interest in that? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Well it's your exclusive right to \"non-physical\" assets (like music, phrases, copyrights, patents). What sparked my interest was my original passion for [i]inventing[/i]. I had a ton of great ideas back in the day, showed them to people who had money, and I watched the majority of them run off with my idea because I was still a highschooler. What I plan on doing with an Intellectual Property degree is protecting my own ideas, which I'll be able to create from scratch with my skills in web dev/design. It's always good to be able to fight for yourself, and I'd recommend anyone who wants to own a business to pursue a degree in Law as well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Definitely couldn't hurt that's for sure. So you have no interest in becoming a lawyer or studying law after you grad? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] Well, having both a CE degree and a Law degree could bring me to different paths. I might just end up being a lawyer and working my way up to the top of my firm. Life can be wonderful if you look at it that way!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Haha no kidding. Well I'd lake to thank you for taking time out of your day/night to be interviewed. If you have any final thoughts you'd like to leave us with feel free to. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1595524][b]bitcube:[/b][/url] All I want to say is \"carpe diem\"; seize the day. Thanks for the experience, and have a great night![/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825]Razor[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News. Today we're here with the HF member Razor. How's it going Razor? Do you have any shoutout's you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] Hey, and thank you for interviewing me :) Good how is it going for you? Shoutouts to Astro and Xownage - thanks for being in the team for such a long time guys! Oh and sorry for any mistakes, my english isn't that good, feel free to correct me haha.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'm good thanks and haha don't sweat it. So, I noticed you are the owner of a very large crypter on HF, care to speak more on that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] It's one of my favorite topics, so feel free to go on :)\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Hahah, so are you the creator of that crypter? What's it called? Did you code it yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] It is called RazorCrypt (there are actually 2 versions - the normal one and the Basic Edition). I am the creator and have coded everything myself.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Good for you man. How long did it take you to code that crypter, and where did you learn how to program?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] I started to learn coding C from books around 7 years ago, after that i learned several other languages, mostly from books, but i took lessons too. \nIt took me around 5 months until i was ready to release the first FUD version, the topic was new to me and as there where no real AutoIT crypters before RazorCrypt i had very limited resources for researching. A lot went wrong while coding, but it was an incredible experience to create something nobody really did before.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's awesome. What language is it coded in? And which languages are you familiar with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] The Crypter is coded in AutoIT. I am familar with C, C++, fasm, ARM,  C#, VB.net, VB6, PHP, SQL, Perl, AHK and AutoIT. Oh the builder is made in C#, but as this is not as important as the stub, I'd say AutoIT.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's quite the list. So do you manage the sales alone or do you have a team that helps the clients with their concerns?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] I manage the sales, but I have a small support team helping out with questions and issues of my clients. Just another small shoutout to them as they do an awesome job :)\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Oh so that's the team you referring to. Anyway, tell us a little about how did you stumbled across HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] I went to HF to buy a crypter (I was experimenting with DarkComet) and bought Cryptex then, 3 days after I purchased it the project got discontinued. That was the time i decided to invest my entire time and energy in making my own crypter and sell a few copies.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I see. Has HF helped you learn more about programming or general computing in any way?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] Yes, definitely. I never really used the WinAPI before i was on HF and my AutoIT skills increased a lot too. I also learned a lot about DDoS migration and protecting my server - they never really got attacked before i was on HF and somehow i even enjoyed some of that DDoS attacks. HF is a great place to gain some knowledge.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Amen. So you obviously spend a lot of time in the Marketplace, but do you ever venture out into other sections of HF? If so which ones?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] Yes, but my activity is a bit random. I often spam the \"View New Posts\" link and as soon as i see an interesting thread i visit it. I have a lot of interests and couldn't really stick to one section.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] If you could change one thing about HF what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] I think it is fine as it is already. The only thing that annoys me sometimes is the time you need to wait between sending PMs.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Yeah, I guess it's just to prevent spam. It would be cool if upgraded members didn't have to wait but I think that's been suggested and denied due to stress on the server? Anyway, do you have any other interests outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] I am very interested in Stage lighting. I spend a lot of my money for new effects and turned my living room into a disco :D\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Well that's a cool hobby ahaha. I'd like to thank you for taking time out of your day to be interviewed. If you have any final thoughts you'd like to share now is the time.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][b]Razor:[/b][/url] It was a pleasure to get interviewed by you. Thank you very much for that.\nI just want to remember anyone on HF that you should be more peaceful and friendly to each other. I have seen a lot of flaming and hate lately and i think we don't really need that. Just enjoy your stay and keep calm :)[/spoiler]",

The bug which hits OpenSSL, a library designed to protect connections from malicious attacks, has had a huge security flaw noted. The flaw allowed for hackers to monitor any data being sent to and from the server. Once the news hit the public, it became a mass scramble for some very big developers to secure their information. Two of the more notable companies were Mojang, the makers of Minecraft, and Steam. The way the exploit works is by allowing a potential hacker to read what was supposed to be secured data, which could contain a private key used for the encryption of the connection between a browser and server. While many people did scramble to immediately fix the issue, there needs to be some thought to this. It wasn't a known exploit from what most sources say until a lab sponsored by Google detected it. The rush was mainly to patch it before some hackers could turn the proof-of-concept into an actual exploitation. While these large services are urging people to change their passwords, people shouldn't overreact; however, this is what one of the Minecraft heads said: \"If you logged in to any of our games or websites in the last 24 hours using your username+password I'd recommend you to change your password.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Facebook and the Magical Dinosaur?[/b][/color]\nEver accidentally posted something to your Facebook wall that you thought was private? Well, Facebook has implemented a truly unique way of showing you that you're posting publicly; a security conscious blue dinosaur, or Zuckersaurus-Rex. Nobody knows it if it to stay, but I personally think it is a creative way to draw attention to what people are posting publicly and not. Many people accidentally post private photos and conversations to their wall daily, this aims in trying to prevent it with an interesting pop-up, featuring the cute dinosaur.\n\nHere is a picture of the dinosaur:\n[spoiler=][img]http://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/facebook-dinosaur-150.png?w=640[/img][/spoiler]\n\nWhether or not this will remain is unknown, when [b]Sophos[/b] asked them whether or not it would they get this response: \"We frequently test new ways to help ensure people are sharing with who they want to on Facebook.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nAutomatic backups are almost a must if you use a computer everyday or you keep important information on your computer. While most of the population doesn't keep backups, it does land many people in a very bad situation. I always whole-heartedly recommend backing up either important folders or an entire drive. Windows has built in software to do both, and it can perform it regularly. Windows has many other great built in tools for automation which can speed up your security work weekly, I suggest everyone look up Windows Task Scheduler.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/RKmUG6A.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Hullcoin: The World's First Local Government Cryptocurrency[/color][/b]\nThe Hull City Council saw the launch of [i]Hullcoin[/i] at a forum this month. While local currencies are not unheard of, a local cryptocurrency officially supported by the government is unprecedented. The reason for the creation of this currency is admirable as well. The Hull City Council created it to help combat poverty, as well as to add value to the local economy. The idea of using a cryptocurrency, instead of a traditional local currency came about when Dave Shepherdson, the Council's Financial Inclusion Support Officer, was asked by Welfare Rights Manager Lisa Bovill to look into alternative currencies as a way to set up an anti-poverty framework. Hullcoin is new, but the City Council is actively mining it with equipment purchased, not with funds from the taxpayers, but with funds supplied by an anonymous donation. This could potentially be a macroeconomic game changer.\n\n[b][color=white]China's Economy Taking a Hit[/color][/b]\nChina, undoubtedly one of the world's fastest growing economies, has taken a hit in recent months, its local currency, the Yuan, depreciating 2.5% in value between February and March. China has also slowed in its import of gold as the demand for the precious metal wanes. Economists predict that China's drop in demand could hurt global gold prices, as well as its local economy. Banks in China are also sitting on the gold, trying to avoid offloading it at a loss due to the depreciating currency. With prices for importing gold between $2.50 and $3.00 per ounce, banks are having trouble finding avenues to turn a profit on the precious metal.\n\n[b][color=white]Regulation Could Rob Bitcoin of its Low Cost Appeal[/color][/b]\nOne of the shining virtues of Bitcoin is the low cost of use, and the low barrier to entry. However, a report published by credit rating agency Fitch Ratings suggests that regulation could remove this appeal, and encumber the process of acquiring Bitcoins. The report also states that Bitcoin, in its current state, is still too small to have any significant effect on payment existing payment systems. While regulation could hamper adoption, regulators will have a difficult time actually controlling any aspect of Bitcoin that does not directly pass through a regulated USD portal, such as a bank, or a credit card processor. Over-the-counter exchanges, such as cash to Bitcoin may be slightly more inconvenient, but are virtually impossible to regulate, so Bitcoin still has a chance. This report follows a recent [url=https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/amend-irs-notice-2014-2taxing-virtual-currencybitcoin-property-stifles-new-technologycreates/z7WtKZGY]petition[/url], asking the IRS notice to be amended to allow for easier technological growth of services, instead of the overly cumbersome record keeping requirments Bitcoin, and other virtual currencies' classification as property would bring about.\n\n[b][color=white]Bill Gross' Stock Picking Cat Dies[/color][/b]\nBill Gross, a money manager for Pimco, lost his prized stock picking cat. No, this isn't an April Fool's day joke. Gross' cat \"Bob\" reportedly was an expert stock picker for the pet industry. Gross commented, \"I often asked her about her recommendations for pet food stocks, and she frequently responded – one meow for 'no,' two meows for a 'you bet.' She was less certain about interest rates, but then it never hurt to ask.\" These comments by Gross have elicited mixed responses from investors. Some sympathetic to his loss, with others less so. One even went as far as to call him the \"financial Lindsey Lohan\". This news follows news of Pimco's eleventh consecutive month of investors withdrawing massive amounts of money from the fund. Gross closed by stating, \"She was always more certain about pet food stocks, but then maybe kitty heaven has given her some additional insight. I shall have to ask her in my dreams. Sometimes dreams come true you know.\"\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/TF7PsyM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft considering Xbox 360 emulation for Xbox One[/b][/color]\nAt Microsoft’s Build developer conference, partner development lead Frank Savage revealed that Microsoft is looking into the possibility of creating an official emulator for the Xbox One, which would allow Xbox 360 games to be run on the Xbox One. When asked about an official Xbox 360 emulator, he replied: ”There are, but we’re not done thinking them through yet, unfortunately,” he said. “It turns out to be hard to emulate the PowerPC stuff on the X86 stuff. So there’s nothing to announce, but I would love to see it myself.” Unfortunately, Savage did not reveal how the emulator would work, if users could just insert Xbox 360 discs or to download them is unknown at this time. \n\n[color=white][b]League of Legends: Ultra-Fire Mode[/b][/color]\nReleased as an April Fool's joke, Riot Games implemented a new game mode into the popular free-to-play game League of Legends. Riot Games announced in a blog post: \"The future of League of Legends is Ultra Rapid Fire and the future is right now. Set to go live next preseason, this massive update will help every player make impactful plays at every stage of the game. To give you a taste of this bold vision of the future, we’ve enabled a special preview queue that’ll be live for the next week. Check out a few of the hardest hitting changes.\" The mode allows every champion to begin the game with 80% cooldown reduction on abilities, activated items and summoner spells. The mode is expected to last a week, but lets see how long it lasts or if it will return later in the week.\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox One to get external storage soon[/b][/color]\nThe continuing problem of using up just about every last gigabyte on your Xbox One may soon come to an end. The feature, which was announced around the time the console was announced, hasn't been seen or heard of since its announcement. A release date is expected to be revealed during or around summertime at the very latest. With many blockbuster games being announced and being released during the summertime, the need for this feature will be needed more than ever. Microsoft's Major Nelson replied on to a post on Reddit which was talking about external storage: :External game storage is coming soon... I need to check on media support”. \n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of April 6, 2014:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Lego: The Hobbit - April 11, 2014 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, Xbox 360, Xbox One\n[*]Titanfall - April 8, 2014 - Xbox 360\n[*]Kinect Sports Rivals - April 8, 2014 - Xbox One\n\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Upcoming Gaming Events:[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]None Reported\n[*]Interested in having your gaming event posted in here?

He also mentioned that the Content Delivery Servers had also been taken control of by these intruders.  Mojang was urgently trying to fix this dilemma and that you will not be able to change your skins until it was fixed. With kids anticipating on when this issue would be fixed, Jeb had also mentioned something else, that it was an April Fool’s joke. \n\n[color=#ffffff][b]Minecraft 1.7.6 pre-release[/b][/color]\nMojang has recently released a pre-release for 1.7.6.  With this update, if a player is banned and then proceeds to change his username; the user still will not be able to connect to the server. Have you always wanted to change your username to Notch, or Dinnerbone? Well you still can’t, names will still be unique and you cannot have the same name as another player. Once a sufficient amount of players will be using version 1.8 or higher name changing will be enabled. \n\n[color=#ffffff][b]12 Million Minecraft Xbox Copies Sold[/b][/color]\nMojang has sold twelve-million copies of Minecraft for the Xbox. They offer a heartfelt thank you to all the players using the Xbox. Mojang also states that without their creativity, Minecraft would not have been anywhere as progressed as it is today. Don’t worry PC, Mac, Playstation 3, iOS and Android users, you are also equally nice, stated by Mojang also.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nOmniscient announced that he may do a map reset after many of the bases were lost and raided during the Factions downtime because of Mcore. He states that he wants a reset, but the players want more than conjecture. He presented three options for HackerCraft players, resetting the map and leaving the rest unchanged, a fresh restart, or no reset at all. You can vote on the thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4156433]here[/url]. Omniscient also stated that he has fixed the negative money bug. \n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white] Minecraft Central[/color][/b]\nMinecraft Central is a custom coded minigames server. The server consists of games such as Hide and Seek, Survival Games, Spleef Run, and many more. As said one of the greatest features of Minecraft Central is the custom coded credits system which awards you with credits after playing a minigame. It also has a custom coded leveling system, adding that extra element to the servers minigames.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

The skeleton grows from birth to the end of teenage years and reaches its maximum strength and size in early adulthood. A study conducted on 463 girls and 484 boys found that boys had spent a significantly larger amount of time in-front of the computer and television. It was also found that unlike boys, girls who spent 4 or more hours in-front of a screen had higher B.M.D., which could not be explained. Boys who spent 4 or more hours in-front of a screen had low B.M.D. and generally higher B.M.I. Such sedentary activity could greatly increase the risk of osteoporosis and fracture risk later in life.\n\n[b][color=white]Depression Increases Heart Failure Risk By 40 Percent[/color][/b]\nModerate to severe depression increases the risk of heart failure by 40 percent, a study of nearly 63,000 Norwegians has shown. During the study period nearly 1,500 people developed heart failure. Compared to residents with no symptoms of depression, people with mild symptoms had a 5% increased risk of developing heart failure and those with moderate to severe symptoms had a 40% increased risk. While it is still not clear why depression greatly increases the risk of heart failure, this is a great find as it is the first study done on the effects of depression on the human heart. The first author of the study, Ms. Gustad, has also stated that the greater and more severe the symptoms, the greater the risk.\n\n[color=white][b]Insomnia May Significantly Increase Stroke Risk[/b][/color]\nA new study of over 80,000 people has shown that those suffering from insomnia have are 8 times more likely to suffer from strokes than those who do not. The American Heart Association found that those that have insomnia are 54% more likely to suffer from multiple hospitalizations from stroke, the risk of stroke is 8 times higher in those that are between 18 and 34 years old and insomniacs who also suffer from diabetes have an even greater risk of stroke. This is the first study so far that tries to quantify the risk of a large population group and is also the first to assess if the risk of stroke differs by insomnia sub-types. It is highly recommended that those who suffer from insomnia contact their physician to have their stroke risk factors assessed and treated.\n\n[color=white][b]Light-Activated Neurons From Stem Cells Restore Function To Paralyzed Muscles[/b][/color]\nScientists have developed a new light-activated stem cell that can help artificially controls muscles can restore function to paralyzed muscles from conditions such as motor neuron disease and spinal cord injury. The technique involves transplanting specially designed motor neurons created from stem cells into injured nerve branches. These motor neurons are designed to react to pulses of blue light, allowing scientists to fine-tune muscle control by adjusting the intensity, duration and frequency of the light pulses. n the study, published this week in Science, the team demonstrated the method in mice in which the nerves that supply muscles in the hind legs were injured. They showed that the transplanted stem cell motor neurons grew along the injured nerves to connect successfully with the paralyzed muscles, which could then be controlled by pulses of blue light.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7zlNcBz.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Ukrainian Journalist Found Dead[/color][/b]\nOn Friday evening, local journalist and member of the Svoboda party Vasily Sergiyenko was reportedly abducted by 3 men. Having been taken from his house, and leaving a trail of blood, they threw him into a white Lada car, which had been previously spotted in the neighborhood. On the 7th of April, the body was found nearly 15 kilometers outside the capital of Kiev in a forest. The man was tortured before he was killed, according to friends. The savage killing left him with stab marks to the knees, kidneys, back and heart. Friends of Sergiyenko say that he was a peaceful man, trying to look after his elderly mother. Our thoughts go out to Sergiyenko’s family and friends.\n\n[b][color=white]India Allows Voting[/color][/b]\nThe people of India will go to the polls to vote in a new parliament and prime minister. The event will be the world’s largest democratic event in history. 543 seats are up for grabs in the lower house of Parliament, and with 15,000 candidates from 500 different political parties, it won’t be easy to get a seat. These ‘politicians’ are expected to spend 5 billion dollars on campaigning, second to the US. The polls are opened for 5 weeks, in efforts to keep things as civilized as possible.\n\n[b][color=white]Obama’s ‘Selfie’ may Result in Lawsuit[/color][/b]\nBaseball star David Ortiz and Obama snapped a selfie, which went viral over the Internet, greatly aided by the tweet that Samsung gave it. Having previously been warned about the using the president to promote their products, Samsung has defended its actions. The White House is looking to pursue the issue with Samsung, and may launch legal action against the company. The White House advisor Dan Pfeiffer told CBS that Obama had no knowledge about the Samsung connection. Funnily enough, Ortiz just signed a new agreement with Samsung.\n\n[b][color=white]MH370 Pinging Back[/color][/b]\nEven though the MH370 passengers and crew have been announced as dead, the search for the flight continues. Having been alerted of the decision by text message by the Malaysian government, the distraught relatives of the passengers are still demanding answers. On Friday afternoon, the Chinese reported the signal of about 37.5kHz on the news. On Saturday morning, the Chinese air force plane sent out to investigate photographed many white objects floating in a similar region, lifting hopes of closure for the families of those lost in this horrific event.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/qIhVVNQ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Amazon Dash to Make Grocery Shopping Easier[/b][/color]\nAmazon is about to make your life a lot easier, again. They are rolling out a beta for their new device, Amazon Dash, which is a pint-sized LED scanner that can be used to have groceries shipped to you. It works by scanning a barcode on an item you are running low on, or you could use the voice software for items without barcodes, such as produce or baked goods. The news of the Dash came pretty much out of nowhere, being announced one afternoon with no previous announcements for anything like it. The Dash works with Amazon Fresh, which is still rolling out in several locations.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Looking to Simplify In-Home Entertainment with Android TV[/b][/color]\nSo it seems that recently, Google has been trying to step away from the concept of Google TV, but supposedly they are on the brink of something better. The Verge claims it has documents showing that a new Android TV release is on the way. The documents show that this new release will be a more conventional living room interface. Instead of revolving completely around apps, the layout will be similar to that of Netflix and Hulu, with the card style. Google has not come out to say anything on these reports, but if they are correct, there should be an announcement soon.\n\n[color=white][b]Windows Phone may be Coming to Cars[/b][/color]\nAs most people know, Microsoft already has a decent sized place in the automotive world as is, but they have never brought a phone interface into a car. This could all be changing soon, seeing as the company gave a presentation this past week to show off Windows in the Car, which is a concept at this point that could basically bring phone apps and functions into the car. The concept looks a lot like a mix between Windows Phone and desktop interfaces. The software will also rely heavily on voice commands, as well as on screen items. As of right now, there is no word on how soon that this software will hit the streets, but we'll keep our fingers crossed for now.\n\n[color=white][b]Users Now Able to Search Yelp Using Emojis[/b][/color]\nNow, in some cool yet seemingly useless news, Yelp has integrated a system into their to allow users to enter an emoji into the search field, and the app will handle the request according. Yelp would then parse any emoji entered in and bring up relevant establishments as a result. This is a fun new addition to the app, but it is not necessarily faster than typing out a full request, unless you memorized most of the emojis. The addition came about when some developers suggested it recently, and the company loved the idea so they implemented it as an official feature in the app.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/eXQx0Yx.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Puff Daddy/P. Diddy Most Charitable Rapper[/b][/color]\nSean Combs is one of the most charitable and philanthropic men in the game right now. He's donated millions to the Harlem Boys and Girls Club, even saving the Club from shutting down. Also donating millions to the [i]Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship[/i]. He also ran the NYC Marathon in 2003 and raised $2 million for schools in NYC for his \"Diddy Run the City\" campaign.\n\nSecond place is household name 50 Cent with his charity \"G-Unity Foundation\" and \"Street King movement. 50 Cent even vowed to feed 1 billion people and even traveled to Somalia and Kenya to raise awareness. Good on 50 and Diddy.\n\n[b][color=white]You can meet Pharrell at Coachella, if you can afford it.[/b][/color]\nPharrell is performing at Coachella this year, and he is now offering two fans the opportunity to meet him during the festival. He is auctioning off a Coachella package that also includes two VIP tickets to the second weekend (April 18 - 20) through eBay. Bidding started at $1,600, and at the time of publishing, the top bid is at $1,855. The auction will end April 15.\n\nEarlier this year he even auctioned off the hat he was wearing for the Grammy's. Don't know why, it's not like Pharrell really needs the money.\n\n[b][color=white]Spike Lee Is Directing Eminem's Video For \"Headlights\"[/b][/color]\nEminem is getting ready to drop the next music video off his last album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He has tapped Spike Lee to direct the video for \"Headlights,\" a song that featured Nate Reuss and was co-produced by Emile, Jeff Bhasker, and Em himself. Em and Spike posed for a picture in Detroit, where it appears the video has been shot. Em's last video was for his collaboration with Rihanna, \"The Monster.\"\n\n[b][color=white]The YouTube Music Streaming Service[/b][/color]\nDelayed because of perfectionism. Patience is a virtue after all and when it's finally here I'm sure it will be amazing. YouTube is joining the highly competitive field already dominated by Pandora, Spotify, and Beats. Billboard cited an unnamed Google executive who said that those involved in the project \"feel that there's just too much scrutiny of this product, and that they need to get it right out of the gate.\" Indeed, the service, which is designed to capitalize on YouTube's massive existing audience. Beyond design, Google, which has reportedly already secured licenses for the streaming service, is working out how it will be able to convince users to shell out $5 to $10 per month for the service when they have already grown accustomed to streaming music for free.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

I mean, I should have expected it, but certain aspects \nof cinema has gone in a strange direction in recent years. The one \nthat really got me was Panic City, an artist that I've taken a liking to, \nreleased a new track preview, which was about 30 seconds of song, \nand a minute and a half of Rickrolling. I also pulled a wee prank of my \nown involving Omnicoin, that sadly went unnoticed, since I never \nposted a link to the prank in the subforum.
