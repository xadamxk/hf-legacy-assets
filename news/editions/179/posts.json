Members may no longer require entrants to threads in the Member Contests forum to post in a sales thread in order to engage in a contest. The thread created by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] on Saturday states the new rule in a very easy to understand manner: \"[i]You cannot create a contest, freebie, or giveaway that requires a post in a separate thread.\"[/i]. This behavior became an issue after threads were repeatedly ed in the Marketplace and the result was often a barrage of illegitimate vouches from people who never laid eyes on the actual product. It is advised that those members who have a current contest open which requires a post in another thread swiftly remove that requirement before higher management does it for you. The thread concerning the change can be read [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4018769][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Possible Rule Sneak Peak[/b][/color]\nFollowing the previous addition of the new rule in the Member Contests forum, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], in a rare moment, has asked the community to discuss a rule before it being implemented. The possible new rule concerns account sales, and would prevent members from buying, selling, or trading any accounts that require payment. Under this new rule, accounts such as Netflix and Spotify Premium would be included. He states that while it certainly wouldn't be a popular rule, he does feel that HackForums is in need of the addition. A negative side effect to this implementation would be of course the closure of many shops in the Marketplace. It being a fairly broad rule covering a wide variety of accounts, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] felt that it would be beneficial to receive feedback from the community concerning the rule. After close to 225 responses were logged, the thread was closed, and those who participated in the discussion were thanked for their feedback. A plan, with the community in mind, is expected to be formulated in the coming weeks. Those who are in the business of shops that would be affected by this possible change have been notified via PM.

This week we're joined with Squidward. How are you doin' this fine evening?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color]I'm doing fine this fine evening, are you doin' fine this fine evening?\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Doin' good, doin' great. Any shoutouts before we begin our interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Omniscient!\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Alrighty then! To start off, tell us a little bit about yourself. Do you really live under the sea?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm an edgy teenager with a super cool account on Hack Forums, where I spend most of my life. Spongebob was my life before Hack Forums, and Squidward was the character I could most relate with. He's cool. I'm cool.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Do you do anything else besides lurking the forums? Going for walks -- maybe?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] Masturbating or sleeping. I usually don't just lurk. I enjoy watching my post count number go up - it makes me feel really good about myself.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] It's good to feel good, amiright? So, did you sign up on the site originally looking for hacks -- or just the lounge?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] I signed up looking for a booter (I think), and then sat in the Minecraft section for a while. Later on I started to look in other forums, and found the Lounge the easiest place to post whore, report rule breakers, and feed trolls. It's a coo' place to be for a cunt like me!\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Coolio. Do you browse other forums/sites -- or is this your main?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] I mainly post in the Lounge nowadays. I also frequent the Minecraft section from time to time, along with the Marketplace. I also enjoy reading the virgins in the Innuendo section post fake stories about their sexual experiences.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interesting. What are your thoughts about the site, as a whole?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] It's Omni's carefully crafted adolescent exploit machine. In other words, it's amazing.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Agreed. Where do you picture yourself a few years from now? Offline and online?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] I'll probably stay on HF for a few more years, and then leave when the new generation of mentally challenged teens comes in. Offline - I'm not sure... Probably living the typical shitty life of the average American.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Are you in school now? If so, what are you studying?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm in secondary school, and studying about boring shit.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Ah, neat. School is a pain -- amiright? Also: what's one thing that you'd change on here? One thing.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] ONE THING?!?!!?! I'd remove the E-Whoring forum. :)\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Thanks for taking the time to join us in this weeks interview. Anything you'd like to say before we're officially finished?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379]Squidward[/url]:[/b][/color] HI MOM!\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]awhty[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News. Today we're joined by the HF member awhty, what's up brother? Do you have any shotouts you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] Shoutout to Eric, Sudsy, Stay Plural and Yellows. All sexy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Excellent. So tell us a little about how you found HF, and what made you want to register?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] I heard about Hackforums from a friend a long time ago, probably around 2009. I registered and made about 11 posts and stopped using the site for almost 2 years. I came back after I realized what a great marketplace the site had and wanted to use that to make some extra money.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, did you end up making any money off of HF? If so would you mind telling us how?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] Yep, probably a few thousand dollars. Although I have spent a lot too. I mostly made money off of original social mediums, I used to be really into cracking email accounts and selling those, and slowly moved into more sites like Reddit and Instagram. Although I don't do that anymore, I've just been relaxing lately\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Right on, did you ever sell any GT's?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] I actually have never sold or purchased a Gamertag, I don't even own an Xbox. I had one in 2011 but it was console banned and I stopped using it and moved onto PS3, and have been playing that ever since.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] You've been on HF for a few years now, and I'm curious; What's the one thing that keeps you coming back?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] I've been somewhat \"inactive\" the last few months on Hackforums, but even then it's always been the Marketplace. If I were to post it was usually in the Marketplace looking to buy or sell something. If I ever need a quick buck I'll sell an Instagram account or something else that I have, I love the simplicity of it and after dealing for so long I rarely run into issues as I don't deal with people who have joined within the last 4-6 months.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Cool cool. What advice wold you give to someone who's newer and is looking to buy or sell items in the marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] Be legitimate. You'll make more money being legitimate than you will scamming. Don't get offended if someone doesn't want to deal with you if you're new, you have to earn respect and that can take some time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Do you feel as if scamming is a big problem on HF? If so, what do you think should be done about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] It has been for a long time, that's for sure. I personally think how Omni is handling deal disputes at the moment is perfectly fine. If everyone was banned for scamming, it would be chaos. Imagine if a deal dispute was faked and someone was falsely banned/repfucked? I think that people need to look into the person they're dealing with a bit more.. if they've joined within the last six months, you're risking that they're just another multiple accounter. Hell, even a year. If you've got a bad feeling about the deal.. don't go through with it and call the deal off. Trust your gut feeling.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I agree 100%. If you could change one thing about HF, what would it be and why? It's perfectly ok to say there's nothing you wish to change.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] I probably wouldn't change anything. I mean, it's got tons of users joining daily and lots of regular members that use the site often. It's doing well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Of course, of course. I noticed you're in the Writ3rs user group. Do you mind sharing some of your responsibilities?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] Yup, the last group I'll probably ever be in on Hackforums aside from ub3r. I left all of my others groups but decided to stick with Writ3rs. I originally did User News alone, but both Sir and I thought having Yellows also helping was a great idea. We take turns doing it every week now. Though one time I had to cover for him because he went to a party and was too drunk to do anything. What a cutie.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Haha ol' Yellers. So you have no interests in any other groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] Not anymore, nope. I left a lot of the groups I was in a few months ago. I lost interest in Hackforums as a whole but slowly came back again (for the marketplace and writ3rs) and now I spend majority of my time just browsing the forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Got ya. Well I'd like to thank you for this interview very much, do you have any last words for the readers?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]awhty:[/b][/url] I'd like to thank you for the interview as well, and I do.

Today we have Jumanji with us for an interview. Hey, any shoutouts before we get down to business?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for having me. I would like to make a shout to my three main homeboys; Rofl Gun, iDul, and Rohz.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Conveniently the three worst Halo players on the forum. Speaking of which, for those who don't know you, tell us about your Halo career so to speak.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Well I appreciate the comment. We take pride in how bad we are in the Halo series. Well I started playing halo online in 2009. Ever since then, I never loved a game more than I did Halo 3. I met a lot of interesting and fun people over the years throughout the Halo community. As you can see, I have the most posts in the Halo section and I take pride in that. Although at times, I am \"known\" for the wrong reasons, I am glad to be some kind of public figure in our HF Halo community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see, I've also been playing halo since 2009. Mostly a social slayer warrior with three guests. But I've been told that you're not good enough to get a 50, and you've bought many over the years. Is this true?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Well at first yes it was true, I boosted many SWAT 50s and slayer 50s before I managed to get my first 50 in Team Slayer. Now the legitimacy of how we got the ranks is a secret I would prefer to keep to myself. I had multiple 50s, and yes I did lose most of them. Everyone in the HF Halo community knows I am barely above average. I just enjoy the game very much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] True, I'd probably 15-0 you like I did to Rohz. Anyway, what brought you to HackForums? You've been here for almost three years now, after all.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Well before I get into how and why I joined hackforums, I would like to mention that I do recall several 1v1s between you and I, and you were on the bottom end of the scoreboard. ANYWAYS, I came to hackforums first because my old forum got closed down. So I did some research to find out how to get free xbox live. I found a thread by the user Tyler, giving out a method to do free one months on Xbox Live. I then noticed there was more to hackforums than meets the eye. I got into the \"booting\" scene and was one of those bad kids who used to hit anyone and everyone just because I could. Now I stay on HF because of the wonderful and friendly community that HF has to offer. I do reside in the Halo section so I understand that many of you will not know who I am. Has it been 3 years? Well that is a long time, but I have enjoyed every minute of being member on this forum. I also try to give back what I can when I can. These forums have taught me so much, and shaped me into the Xbox Live legend that I am today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You owned a forum? What was it about and why'd it get closed down?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry, let me rephrase that. I get a little cocky sometimes. It wasn't my forums, it was a forum for a GPT website. I said it was mine, because I pretty much was the most important person on that forum. They closed down, and I had to move on. I don't regret moving on at all to be honest. I am glad I found HackForums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Oh, I gotcha. Like how the Halo section is 'yours'. Anyway, judging by your usertitle is it true you're a 420 blaze it stoner?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] I see you what you did there. The Halo section is indeed mine. I would give anything to be able to moderate my section. Like my motto says, Music and weed is all you need. I am indeed a \"420blazeit\" stoner. I have been smoking for 8 years now. Another reason why I enjoy HF as well, I see many other weed lovers post every now and then.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Are you one of those crazy HF drug addicts that do like heroin and stuff and have crazy stories? If not, I still want to here a crazy pot story.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Well actually I used to be a \"coke head\". I have snorted a lot of coke and had a serious alcohol problem at one point. I haven't touched coke and I rarely drink since I had that terrible incident at a house party. I was already drunk before I got the party and when we got there we drank some more. We went outside to go smoke a few bowls, and at that point I black out. I don't remember much else. I remember little flashes here and there of snorting up coke through a rolled up dollar bill. To cut the story short, I woke up in the hospital the next day covered in my own vomit and piss. Apparently I had OD'd on cocaine and alcohol poisoning. If it wasn't for my sister calling the ambulance I am not sure I would be here today. Of course, now I owe the hospital $5k. Lesson learned, drugs are expensive. Craziest pot story I have was when I was smoking with my friends literally 2 minutes from my house in a canal. I was still living with my mother at this time. We had just finished smoking and we are on our way back when a cop car is waiting for us. Being the rebellious person that I am, I tried fighting for our freedom. It made it worse, we ended up getting arrested and spent the whole night in jail. The only mugshot that exists of me, is a picture of me smiling with super bloodshot red eyes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Oh god, I'd love to see that mugshot. Anyway, you're a twitch streamer, eh? Where can HF members watch you get smacked in H3?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] Well I personally don't stream halo 3. I usually play with the member Rofl Gun, and you can find him streaming on [url=http://www.twitch.tv/rofl_gun]/roflgun[/url]. As for me, well Twitch and I aren't on the best of terms. I usually have to go through about 2 accounts and 2 IPs a week. They constantly ban me. I am known for certain things in the Halo 3 streaming community. Go into a halo 3 stream on twitchtv and ask about me. You will get mixed reactions. It's part of being famous right? You have people that love you, and then people that hate you.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well I know you've been away from the xbox live gaming scene for a few months. Heard from a little birdy you just got into it again. What's that like?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] It is amazing. I would like to take a second real quick to thank the member Rofl Gun for everything he has done for me. Recently, life has been somewhat hard having to pay your own bills and things like that. It's funny you don't realize what life is really like until you don't have mommy or daddy around to hold your hand. Anyways, I had to sell my xbox so I could pay for rent. This was about 5-6 months ago. Last week [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=799829]Rofl Gun[/url], out of nowhere decided to send me an xbox 360, controller, and a headset + $57 shipping keep in mind...for free. I am loving halo 3 again, playing about 9 hours a day because it has been a very long time. I just really wanted to let people know that Rofl Gun really is my homeboy and has been there for a lot. Nicest thing anyone has ever done for me to be honest.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That was really nice of him. Glad to see there are some great members still here on HF. But oh, look at the time. Anything else before I go, bud?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=761719][color=white][b]Jumanji:[/b][/color][/url] I would just like to say thank anyone and everyone for taking the time to read my interview. Stop by MY halo section if you enjoy the halo series. We enjoy seeing new faces come around. Thanks for the interview. Also, if you hate me because you read my interview. Play with me on xbl, get to know me. I am more than meets the eye.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] [spoiler][img]http://i.imgur.com/u4qVwaY.gif[/img][/spoiler][/spoiler]",

Major Nelson said this in reply to a question on the popular website Reddit. \"We are way aware of this and many of the concerns of the community - we have some great stuff planned for Xbox One this year (and beyond.) As soon as we can share some of the goodness...we will,\" he said, however, he did not mention when we could expect competitive pricing on the marketplace. Currently, Xbox One downloads are just as expensive on the marketplace as in-store.\n\n[color=white][b]MLG CEO Challenges Twitch[/b][/color]\nIn an interview, MLG CEO has challenged the Twitch.tv streaming service stating that broadcasters can earn more money from streaming on the MLG website. \"It's harder to broadcast on right now, but they'll make more money,\" said DiGiovanni. \"They'll make significantly more money. It's not one-button streaming, but it's not meant to be either. The key to it is: If you produce live content, have a meaningful audience, and want to make money off of advertising, our numbers are far stronger at the moment. Based on what we've seen on our content on both and what we've heard from partners.\" DiGiovanni also stated that there is more work to be done regarding other service features and such does not include monetization. \"In terms of it being better in any other way, I think the global reliability is really solid. I'm not going to say it's better because I can't speak to that. In terms of the image quality, I think it's great, but I'm not going to say it's better. In terms of chat, I think we have some work to do to figure out what we want to do there but right now. Twitter chat does a lot on the social side, but doesn't do a lot in terms of the real-time exchange that people are used to.\" Streaming in 2014 is going to get bigger and better from all major parties with streaming services. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nHow far would you go to save your Xbox?\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cn-cpWuSBw[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j5tt3ZeAOMRST.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft Hits 1 Million Sales on PS3![/color][/b]\nVery shortly after their very anticipated release of Minecraft on the Playstation 3, Mojang has reached an enormous milestone of over one million sales. The game, similar to the Xbox 360 version, is as closely resembled as possible to the PC version for all of the game's console lovers. Though it's not quite identical to the PC version-- as it lacks some features--it's still an awesome game to play with your friends over Playstation Network.\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot 14w04b[/color][/b]\nSnapshot after snapshot, Minecraft gets closer to its next biggest release. Alongside plenty of bug fixes, additions, and features, snapshot 14w04b has even more to offer. The snapshot allows users to rotate framed items by 45 degrees (rather than the traditional 90), interact with tons of changes/additions to the villager AI, place buttons on ceilings and floors, and find out Mojang's \"secret changes,\" or so they say.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nIn recent news, Omniscient's Vegas side came out of him with HackerCraft's addition of slots and blackjack.

Germany, however, has taken their support to a whole new level! The athletes lucky enough to participate in the Winter Olympics will be wearing uniforms with rainbow colors. The designer who created the clothing said: \"it's not really a protest, but that's how the public has interpreted it to be.\" The colors that have been used consist of: blue, white, yellow, and green on the jacket. For the pants, it's a nice bright white for the males and red/orange for the females. The German flag can also be seen on top of the hats being worn.\n\n[color=white][b]Explosion in Cairo[/b][/color]\nClouds of smoke rose up Friday, January 24th at the headquarters of Cairo's police station. The cause of the smoke would be an explosion from waves of bombings, which occurred at different times. The first bombing took place when an unidentified male tried to drive a truck into the Headquarters. Guards all around began firing at the truck, trying to stop it before it hit the building; they tried to prevent it from blowing up inside to prevent the explosion from hurting anyone inside. The first few floors were struck, windows were blown apart, and you were able to see all the appliances and wires hanging about. Reports show that four people were killed, 50 were wounded, and fear has been the emotion of almost everyone who was in a close vicinity. After the first explosion hit, another two came shortly after. This explosion killed one person. Shockingly, a fourth explosion hit. Instead of the police station, it hit a theater in Giza City. One person was killed and around 5+ people were injured. Government officials are coming to a conclusion that all of these were caused by suicide bombers. This all took place the day before the third anniversary of the revolution that happened in 2011, which is when Hosni Mubarak was brought down.\n\n[color=white][b]Unethical Occurrences in India[/b][/color]\nIn a tribal village in West Bengal, a 20-year-old girl reported to the police that she was gang raped, and that the village leader instructed the men involved to do so. Why did this happen? Well, allegedly, the girl (unknown and has not been released to the public) had an affair with another man in a different village. After they abused her and did everything they could to hurt her, they tried their best to make sure she couldn't reach a local hospital. As of now, she's safe-and-sound and is being treated medically. The suspected perpetrators have been rounded up and arrested for questioning. India's officers have been trying to crack down rapists more and more, and it's very crucial for them to lock up the bad guys before they harm anyone. Back in 2012, a girl in her early twenties was beaten up and raped inside of a bus. Shortly after, the girl passed away. Locals are not the only victims; people traveling from across the globe have been unlucky prey for these predators. Recent news stories have shared with the public that a Danish woman was gang raped, too. With various different sexual harassment, groping, and even worse stories, the media has been trying to promote better safety for women, which includes how women are treated. With that being said, could small firearms be the best way for women to protect themselves? A small pistol has already been created with the name \"Nirbheek\", which translates to Fearless from Hindi to English. Gun laws are very strict in India, and licenses aren't given out as easily like some countries. Although this will continue to happen for years, hopefully these unethical occurrences will come to an end.\n\n[color=white][b]Protests in Ukraine[/b][/color]\nWith Ukraine debating to be apart of Russia or the EU, the locals have been spiraling up dangerous riots and spreading the word that the people should have a say. The Ukrainian government is leaning towards Russia to be allies and possible help with the current financial state. If they were to join the EU, the Ukrainian's would get a higher standard lifestyle and better trading & access with other countries out west. What happened? The government ignored the rights of the people, created new laws, such as one that limited the right of protesting in Ukraine. Others included putting up blockades in public places and even being locked up for saying the slightest rude thing to an official; some people see it slowly turning into a dictatorship. Freedom of speech in Ukraine is slowly fading away. In addition to that, you're not allowed to wear masks or helmets at rallies. Any sort of campsite, movement in bulk (vehicles) are banned as well, unless permission has been granted by the police. During protest movements, four individuals were killed in a fight against the police; the police have also injured hundreds of other protestors. Three leaders have spoken to President Viktor Yanukovych to stop what's going on. Vitali Klitschko, leader of the UDAR party, said that he will attack if the President doesn't put an end to this. Images, videos, you name it have been shared across the world, and on local Ukrainian TV. Some images include the fights going on and the massive crowds that gather around to be involved in the movement.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jqIAAPcV7GZi2.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Google Shows You What You're Clicking On[/b][/color]\nGoogle has shown its vast knowledge about the internet multiple times, but this past week, they have expanded that. Google now shows you background information on sites in its search results as it makes an effort to further inform you. It works by using site information from Google's Knowledge Graph to show you a summary about the site you are about to click on. This could help guide users so they do not click on any malicious links. This service is not 100-percent accurate yet, but it is pretty close.\n\n[color=white][b]FBI Tells Retailers To Expect A Lot More Credit Card Data Theft[/b][/color]\nRecently, there was a story regarding credit card data and it being compromised at Target leading many people to worry if they were one of the affected. This was undoubtedly a big scare, but more may be on the way. The FBI has warned retailers that it expects more of these intrusion attempts to happen in the near future. It said these attempts will be made through malware that grabs the account information from cash registers and credit card readers. There is no idea on which store will be next, but it is obvious that credit card theft is a growing problem.\n\n[color=white][b]Scientists Prove Dwarf Planet Contains Water[/b][/color]\nScientists have long believed that the dwarf planet \"Ceres\" contained some form of water, but had no evidence to back up the claim. This past week, though, an ESA-led team has proven that the dwarf planet is spewing water vapor from two points on its surface. This was found by using signal fluctuations to scan the planet. They do not know what exactly is causing this water vapor, but speculate it to be geysers or icy volcanoes. We are expected to know more in 2015 when NASA's Dawn probe goes out and maps the planet's water activity.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Patents Ads That Will Give Free Rides To Advertised Locations[/b][/color]\nGoogle has filed a new patent that offers potential buyers a trip to the advertised store. The internet giant is apparently toying with the idea of arranging transportation for people who want to visit the stores advertised. It will use people's information to determine what sort of transportation to offer. This information includes location, job, purchasing history, and few other factors. This means customers that are more high-profile than others will get better treatment, while normal folks will get discounted taxi fares. There is no word on whether this will even roll out or not.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbsk2wRCmm4QLJ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Grammy Winners[/color][/b]\nSunday was the Grammys and here are the winners.

Eminem has hit a groove after dropping his big comeback album Relapse LP in 2009 and is once again on top of the rap world after releasing his latest The Marshall Mathers LP 2. So what's next for Em? Looks like a possible D12 reunion album. The Dirty Dozen hasn't dropped an LP since 2004's D12 World, but long-time Eminem producer Mark Bass told the Detroit Free Press that he is busy mixing new tracks from the group, three of which feature Em. Can't wait.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbtobAO1a50qPD.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n-=-=-\nCommunication.\nOh fuck is communication important.\nCommunicate clearly and concisely.\nCommuni-fucking-cate.",

Everyone with a little bit of common sense\nshould know that you cannot trust everyone on the internet.\nOn the other hand though, am I a little bit upset about\nthis recent change. I offered that kind of service myself,\non-site and earned quite some money, sadly it is not\nallowed anymore so that is basically a loss of money for me.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1932509][i]-Tastylicous[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think that this was an excellent decision, however \nit will have a negative impact on those who used it for \nlegitimate purposes. Some people make $100's of dollars \nfrom holding money for other members, and it will have \nruined that for them. However, the decision made by \nOmniscient will surely reduce the number of scams \nperformed, albeit by a small amount. In other news, \nit is my birthday today (27th) - so happy birthday to me. \nKeep up the HQ news!\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][i]-Spyro The Dragon[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I've never been around the whole PayPal holding \nscheme, or even much in the marketplace in fact. It \ndoes have its ups and downs, such as a plus side being, \nif you did in fact get banned from PayPal but still needed \ntheir services, someone else could just as easily hold your \nfunds. Although, they could just as easily run with the \nmoney, creating more scam reports, or just get themselves \nbanned from PayPal from what that user is doing. I do see \nhis reasons to put in this rule, possibly less scam reports \n(I don't actually know how many times this has happened). \nI guess if you wanted someone to hold your funds, get a \nfriend to do it or a relative, it'd be better then getting a \nservice that could possibly scam.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1189959][i]-BR3TT[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I feel that Omniscient's new decision on prohibiting \nPaypal Holding was made for the best. Even tho i can see \nmany people doing it \"underground\" but yet his number \none goal was to make sure people don't get fucked over \nnot only that but it will endorse the crypto-currency \nmarket which will make people who are under the age of \n18 still can have a business going on.
