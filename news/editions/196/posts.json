We will be expanding the HF News and optimizing the Writers in the endeavor of obtaining perpetual simplicity. If you've ever been interested in getting into the HFNT / Writers, now's the best chance you will have for a long while. Head on over to the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4262335]W4TCHL2ST[/url] and apply!\n\n[color=white][b]Staff Changes and New Mentors[/b][/color]\nThis week brought major changes to the Hack Forums moderation teams, with two new staff members and two new mentors. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=956054][b][color=white]Emylbus[/color][/b][/url], after being granted the position in January, recently stepped down as a staff member and returned to his position as Mentor. To reciprocate, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] promoted two hardworking members to probational staff: [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=23809][color=#9999FF][b]Viral Dragon[/b][/color][/url], a long time leader of the community and head of the HF Wiki Team; and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][color=#9999FF][b]RDCA[/b][/color][/url], previously only a member of the HFNT. In addition, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][b][color=white]Roger Waters[/color][/b][/url] (also a member of our news team) finally earned his promotion to Mentor, and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][b][color=white]adampelletgun[/color][/b][/url] was reappointed to Mentor. It's not surprising that these members received promotions; anyone who visits the Rules, Announcements, News, and Feedback section knows that these few in particular are always on top of things. Congratulations, and good luck with your new positions!\n\n[color=white][b]Goodwill Monday[/b][/color]\nOn the first Monday of each June, it's a tradition for Hack Forums members to spread their good will through positive reputation. Goodwill Monday, which fell on June 2nd this year, was declared an \"official HF Holiday\" by Omniscient in 2011. Regarding Goodwill Monday, Omniscient writes [i]\"On this day you'll be asked to give 5 positive reputations to members that you feel have been a positive and contributing influence to HF. This is the day when you stop all the negative crap and think positively by giving out some good vibes and positive reps.\"[/i] Did you spread the good will this year?\n\n[color=white][b]Major Omnicoin Exploit[/b][/color]\nOmnicoins, which gained a spike in popularity after the implementation of the OMC-exclusive [i]3P1C[/i] rank, recently took a blow after two users exploited popular online OMC wallets. Collectively stealing 190,000 omnicoins from the community, the users Tenaxium and ~OMC~ allegedly gained $2500 USD through their exploitations of omniwallet.org and omc-wallet.com. Accusations have been made and chat logs have been posted, and both members admitted to their wrongdoings; Tenaxium even apologized to the community (who didn't take too kindly to his story).  The outraged members whose Omnicoin wallets were stolen from received slight consolation after [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1759389][color=black][b]Tenaxium[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked and banned and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1983655][color=#383838][b]~OMC~[/b][/color][/url]'s account was closed. Many users active in the Omnicoin community agree that this incident will hurt Omnicoin, however operations seem to be back to normal and our HF crypto-currency looks to be rebounding.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Uquxypc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1055259][color=#EFEFEF][b]Soccer[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 reputation points.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]News Notables[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] Seen a member of Hack Forums do something amazing for someone?

The group name was changed in the past due to copyright issues between members; however, the semantics of the change were worked out and it looks like a green light for the switch. Instinct, run by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771]Vinnie[/url], is easily the most respected gaming group on the forum to date, so this change is highly anticipated.  The changes will most likely go through in the following weeks.\n\n[color=white][b]Important Group Threads[/b][/color]\n[list]\n\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4240553][b]Aviate's Sidekicks [Endorsed by Nexus][/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1605930]Aviate[/url]\n\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4252807][b]Legacy | Official Gaming Group | Userbar, Banner, Ficon[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]\n\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4250573][b]Nexus - Garry's Mod Sector | Recruitment! |[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2018301]TisWaldo[/url]\n\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4229571][b]Nexus Group Membership | 1500 OMC[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112]Saturday[/url]\n\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4248732][b]Offical Group - Enterprise- Userbar/Banner [$100][/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1042439]~HF~[/url]\n\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4241674][b]The Brotherhood | VFX Student Program | Recruitment[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2148285]Ego ‎‎‎[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Leadership Changes[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=#EFEFEF][b]Phenomenal[/b][/color][/url] is no longer leader of Nexus.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1203712][color=#EFEFEF][b]iKinky[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Nexus.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951][color=#EFEFEF][b]Evangelist[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a leader of The Empire.\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/8TcOu.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]New 3P1C Feature Comes Forth[/color][/b]\nA new feature, for both Ub3rs and 3p1cs, is the ability to initiate vacation bans without the aid of Staff. This new feature was announced around midnight on the 17th of May. This will serve both as an aid to users, Staff, and Admins, easing up on their workload. This is just one of the upcoming features Omniscient has planned for the 3p1c usergroup in the near future. Stay tuned, this magician has many other tricks up his sleeve.\n\n[b][color=white]Omnicoin Surpasses 20,000 Blocks Mined[/color][/b]\nOmnicoin is one fifth of the way to its first halving. After one month, twelve days, Omnicoin hit a major milestone of 20,000 blocks, or 1,337,000 coins mined. It's right on par with the average amount of time it should take to hit the halving. This shows Omnicoin's doing quite well in terms of stability, and should continue to maintain stability throughout its life-cycle.\n\n[color=white][b]New competitions to encourage more users to use Omnicoin[/b][/color]\nFollowing up on Omniscient's 2,000 OMC competition, the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1881806]Jack Sparrow™[/url] has suggested a 25,000 OMC tutorial contest. The 25,000 OMC have been spread across the first place and runner-ups, resulting in 1x10,000 OMC, 2x5,000 OMC and 5x1,000 OMC prizes. The submission thread can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4226430]here[/url] and the contest ends on the 1st of June. Moreover Omniscient has given out a 10,000 OMC bounty to the user with the best website design, aimed at the new official Omnicoin website omnicoin.org. The competition was won by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1290620]Designer[/url] and the new design is already live on the website.\n\n[color=white][b]New Marketplace Section for Exclusive Omnicoin Offers[/b][/color]\nA new subsection has been added to the premium sellers section, with the purpose of further highlighting exclusive Omnicoin offers, that is offers which are only purchaseable with Omnicoins. These exclusive offers might be just what Omnicoin needs in order to get known across the forums.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yVoOuuj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3188086][b]The Empire - Personal Advice & Innuendo Help Desk[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b]Tibit[/b][/url] - One of the best threads I've seen in my time on HF, recently reopened in the past week or so.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4239971][b]Polymath | Are you looking to pursue higher education? | College Help Desk[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2177647][b]Angel￼[/b][/url] - This thread offers a vast range of help to anyone currently in high school or college.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4243558][b][HackForums Pokdex] Come and find out which Pokmon you are![/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2247548][b]Victini[/b][/url] - Discover your inner Pokemon with this unique thread.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4107079][b]QUIZ - What Type of Gamer Are You?[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][b]The Elite[/b][/url] - For one reason or another this thread has gotten quite a bit of attention over the past month or two.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4251644][b]The best Optical Illusions (CHECK THIS)[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=810513][b]Milker[/b][/url] - A few unique optical illusions, some of which I still can't wrap my head around.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4067069][b][Talk] Share your protection setup[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1495835][b]Aura[/b][/url] - With over 30 pages this thread might be a good start to if you're wanting to purchase an anti-virus.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3624263][b]The Auto-Pilot Lifestyle - No Investment (80+ Vouches)[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=673593][b]Lucidity[/b][/url] - This free ebook seems to have racked up quite a bit of attention since it's been posted.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4242859][b][Announcement] My temporary resignation from the White Hat Help section[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1495835][b]Aura[/b][/url] - With the news of his acceptance as a GTG trainee, for a short period of time Aura will not be able to assist anyone in malware removal.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/IDI7isd.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189]+Oblivious[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 196th edition of the HF News, today we're here with +Oblivious. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] Before we begin, I'd like to make a shout-out to fbn, to my brother Black Soul on HF, and to my friends on the OMC skype chat: Matt, Scotty, Flashy :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty good mix of people, when you say brother do you mean actual brother or a really good friend?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] When I say brother, I'm talking about my actual brother, in real life. In the same room at the current moment. But we're good friends, off and on actually. You know how brothers are. We live under the same roof.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I know a few people with family members on site, but I have to ask because it's a question I've always wondered. Was there any suspicion of multi accounting? I know staff takes that very seriously, did you have to prove anything to staff or admins before making an account?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] Of course, there were suspicions of multi-accounting. But common sense and actual proof prevailed. You see, if a relative of yours shares the same IP, you have to PM a site administrator and give them the information they require. I have PMed Paradoxum a long while ago actually, and it all went well. At first, when I registered, I didn't know much about the rules concerning relatives on HF. But I then became aware that staff had to know that we were relatives. So yeah, I PMed Paradoxum, and a 'note' has been put on our accounts saying that we are relatives.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's good to hear, I've seen a countless number of people ask and I have been wondering myself without ever getting a clear answer. So why did you pick the name +Oblivious? Any meaning behind it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I wanted to pick a username which described me best. I am quite oblivious in real life, so I wanted the username Oblivious... But since it was already taken, I had to go with +Oblivious. I don't fancy special characters anyway, I like showing up on the members list when people type my username, something which is not available for users who used special characters for their username. But hey, that's just me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I see a lot of people using + in their usernames, wasn't sure if there was a secret Hack Forum's + gang I didn't know of. So what do you do outside of the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] There might be one, none of which I'm aware of though. Outside of HF, you could simply say that I'm a bored guy looking for good entertainment. I mainly do tags, or forum signatures, hang around the internet and on Skype, trade a bit of crypto currencies here and there, watch anime (not the ones with 'little girls' as some may say, the psychological/supernatural genre is my favorite). In real life, I also love to read a good book.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I do enjoy myself a good book. Read anything good lately that you can pass on to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] Well, considering the fact that I'm french-canadian, I mostly read books in French. One of my favorite writers: Guy De Maupassant. I am sure and certain that there is a translation for Le Horla which is a superb story narrating the writer himself experimenting paranormal activities in his own house: An invisible being messing around with him. The writer had a sort of mental breakdown after finishing with writing the book. Was the creature real? Or simply a hoax? I'm not one to believe in fairy tales, but hey, who knows?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds pretty intense. Not sure who found HF first, you or your brother, but what made you guys join?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] I found HF first. I was a moderator on a discussion board, and some people were talking about HF and its marketplace. I didn't have anything when I came here, so I had to manage. Eventually, I made $10 from a certain method, I bought in Eminence. There was a rapping contest hosted by bugga, and I won it. I didn't buy my l33t, but I bought my 3p1c with the thousands of OMCs I have at disposal.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice, glad to see it worked out for you then. How would you rate your overall HF experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] It had its ups and downs. But overall, I can say that I love HF. I come home from work, and it's the first forum I check. I met a lot of lovely and nice people here. Without HF, I don't think that I'd be who I am. I wouldn't have met my friends, or anything like that. I'm not really good with giving ratings in numbers, but I'd say 9/10. Some things may need improvement, but that's manageable. Great job, Omni.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could change one thing on site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I think that if I could change one thing on HF, I think that I'd change the banner. It's okay, but it could be much better if more time is put into it, but hey, it's what makes HF special after all.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's all the time I've got for this interview, would you like to make any concluding remarks?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1041189][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Oblivious:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to thank you for taking the time to interview me. It was my pleasure. I'd also like to tell the news team that they're doing an amazing job at what they are doing.

What's going on?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm doing surprisingly good, considering that I just had my heart broken by a girl. Big changes are coming, one of which is planning on telling my parents sometime soon about my female-to-male transgender status.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interesting -- best of luck to you! anyone you'd like to give a shoutout to before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] I'd like to give a shoutout to 'Sin, Kiosi and bitcube and everyone in Brotherhood and Empire!\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Hello to them! What brought you to the site? Have you upgraded to Ep1c yet?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes I have upgraded to 3P1C the moment it first came out (can't remember the date). As for what brought me over to Hack Forums, well...I was part of an official game forum and I was looking for MapleStory hacks and one of the Google searches pointed to this site. I signed up, grabbed what I needed and headed back to my game. I signed up around June 2013 but didn't start getting active until last month, when I got fd up with the Pay-To-Win aspect of the game and some forum drama with someone that got moderator status, who started powertripping. Looking for a new home, I landed back on Hack Forums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Welcome back to the site! What's the thing that you like on this forum that kept you hooked and posting? The community?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] The community and various places you get to post in. For such a large size, you always run into the same people, forging bonds with them as you post and you meet someone new everyday that might be inspired by what you have written. While the community may have it's share of bad apples, there are still people out there that actually care about you and give you emotional support even in the face of the unknown. It's like this whole community, in a way, is a family away from reality and let's me know that we're all here learning and getting through life together.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's actually a  great way to put it, Marc. So what do you do outside of the internet? Are you on your summer break?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm already well out of school, graduated from college with a BA in Psychology this January. I generally go and workout most of the time, listen to music, watch some old movies and try to look for a full time job. Finding a job, since I lost my first one, it's been real tough out there when you have no experience. I've also been rejected from graduate school so I'm practically at a low point in life but this opened my eyes to what I really wanted to do: web developing. I remember back in the day that I made some MySpace layouts and made Tumblr themes for myself so I wouldn't mind delving deeper into that field. In my opinion, I think it would go hand-in-hand with graphic design as I already have some good knowledge of Photoshop since I've been playing around with it since I was 13. While my career path is unclear as of now, I think it's time I grab some books and start learning these web programming languages while I work at any job I can get my hands on.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  I'd imagine you could do some freelancing on the side as well. I've always wanted to get into that kind of stuff. In my opinion, reading books to learn programming is always tough for me. More of a visual learner, you know? Anyways -- has HF aided you in your programming journey in any way?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b] Other than for book suggestions, no but I know I will receive help once I start toying around with code and stumble onto a problem that I can't seem to solve. I'm quite the visual learner myself but I really need a physical book that I can have in my hands take notes on because I can't do eBooks. I just can't because it leaves me susceptible to distractions like Skype conversations and League of Legends calling for me, begging me to play it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Speaking of league, what division/rank are you? (if you play ranked?) Do you play on NA? Nexus seems like it would be a great group for you.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm actually still new to the game, currently level 19 and playing normals until I get to level 30. I do play on the NA server, summoner name is the same as my Hack Forums username. I did actually apply for Nexus but I'm going to assume I got denied or they haven't added anyone that didn't buy in yet.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Ah, true. How are you enjoying it? Do you play any other games besides League?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] The game is great! I already have a few favorite champions like Nasus, Warwick and Riven. Aside from League of Legends, I play some Steam games from time to time, mostly old SEGA Classics since I'm a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan ever since I was little and I misplaced my old SEGA Genesis. Aside from that, I do play Pokemon on my Gameboy Color/Nintendo 3DS, depending on version. However, I'm still waiting to get Pokemon X and a Nintendo 3DS XL because I feel left out since just about everyone I know has it. WHo knows, I might luck out since my birthday is just around the corner.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Happy early birthday! You've also been here for roughly a year now. Any changes that you'd like to see get made?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] In my opinion, the reputation system and staff's involvement within the marketplace (ex. deal disputes) do need to be remodeled. With the creation of Omnicoin, those changes might be implemented real soon and I just need to play the waiting game. This is definitely the most unique forum I've ever been on because what other forum has their own currency and a supportive community backing it? Omni must be raking in the money.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Not a doubt. Thanks for your time on this interview. Anything you'd like to say before we're finished?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1860651]Marcellow[/url]:[/b][/color] I just wanted to say that I love you all.^^ *opens arms*\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205]guycheap[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 196th edition of the HF News, today we're here with guycheap. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] Hey, thanks for choosing me as an interviewee big shoutout to Chris, Eternal, Daisy and the rest of 143, without them I could not possibly have been where I am today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm looking at your userbars and you aren't in there... Why the big shoutout?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] I left 143 sometime ago, had some personal issues and made a mistake, I was kicked out of the group because of that mistake but I still remain in touch with everyone from there. They are still family <3.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry to hear that. Has the group had a good impact on your Hack Forums experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] No That's fine, it's not about the pixels its about the relationships you discover within those pixels. I would have to agree 100% that 143 has had a great impact on my HF experience, because of them I have hosted multiple giveaways, I learned to give away and love everyone based off of 143's philosophy, I Love You. 143 has been there for me since the starting of my HF profile, I was upgraded to L33T by Cody & Daisy Actually. Thanks to some pranksters I was invited to 143, so special thanks to those pranksters haha. 143 has been a huge influence towards my positive life on HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! What do you do outside of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] Well outside of HF I like to browse other forums for something interesting, I also like to play CS through steam, if that gets a bit too boring I play GTA 5, I've got to admit though I am very addicted to GTA 5. Now I'm sure your probably thinking I've got no social life but I promise I do, I go outside chill with friends, I go to school talk to people learn, study and also have fun!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What systems do you play? Looking forward to any upcoming titles?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] At this point I'm a massive PS3 & PC Fan. I just love the way the graphics are created and the story line between the games on the PS3 & PC. I understand the Xbox is the same but it all comes down to personal preference. Actually yes, I'm really looking forward to Watch Dogs, I'm a technical sort of guy so something like Watch Dogs where you hack into systems and such is a massive attraction to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah I'm looking forward to that as well. So tell me more about these pranksters, 143 comes off as a prestigious and hard to get into group, how did you meet their requirements?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url]Well it started off with my being the a** kisser I am, not that I meant to be but I understand know how I looked like while spamming the 143 thread, it's also evident in my rep how users thought I was a** kissing up to 143. Anyways, it started off with I believe Baghead and a couple others PM'ing me about being invited to the group, at that point I was partying but within an hour it was pretty clear they were all trying to prank me, they also took to the 143 official thread on congratulating me just to make it look legit. An example would be here I actually had about 80% of this page dedicated to me being invited into the group, Vinnie also posted this regarding my membership, and also here and then I had one of my best bro's Evang support me here it seems most of them knew it was a troll, I then posted this message here stating my disappointment, Cody then posted the magic words, can't forget them no matter what. Cody said \" okes on them now big man. Welcome to the family. \". I think I lost it there. Yellows then shortly posted a message about my a** kissing and such here Cody also posted this so that's basically how I was invited to 143, I can't forget that day because it was like a dream come true. To be honest, 143 has NO requirements it's simply how you present yourself, and I'm not saying go and PM Eternal is the best way possible I'm saying present yourself in a way that leaders approve of such as contests, help members, and don't just do it for the group do it out of the kindness in your heart.\nPS: Sorry about that HUGE essay bro, got too excited, hope you don't mind. Also would you mind adding another member to the shoutout? Sorry for being such a pain, I was reading the thread and I remembered the amazing friendship me and Evang had. Just put Evang as one of the shoutouts if possible he knows who he is :). Thanks so much <3 and sorry again for such a HUGE paragraph.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well at least it worked out in the end. So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] True. Well, I was just chilling on the internet like everyone, at that point I was really interested in Key loggers, I went on youtube to search on how to set it up and in the video HackForums.net was mentioned, I quickly joined to broaden my knowledge & I'm glad I did.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! How would you rate your overall experience on a 1-10 scale?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] I'd have to go with a 9 / 10, this place has taught me so much and I've tried to give back to my full limit, it's a place where I spend 95% of my free time browsing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any future contests or giveaways planned?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] For sure. I've got a new Ebook coming out, with profit hopefully I'll be running a huge giveaway and donating some of the money towards contests for other users etc.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I've never been much of an eBook writer, how's the eBook market?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] So far, not good. I'm not the perfect writer either but I'm not in it to make money, I'm in it to help users make money, due to the majority of the authors finding free ebooks and rewording them the ebook market has a bad reputation, because of this about 1 in 30 authors are real, while the others are simply copy + pasting with some changes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Ah, it seems like an interesting market, but one with a lot of controversy. If you could change one thing about Hack Forums what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] Well, to be honest HF is perfect the way it is, ofcourse everything has flaws but these flaws make the perfect place. And to add to that Omni is someone who knows his cards well, therefore I'm not wanting to question him as he knows exactly what to do :).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well I think that's all the time I've got for this interview. Do you have any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536205][color=white][b]guycheap:[/b][/color][/url] Not really, just want to thank you for interviewing me and I wish you a great day.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003]'Sin[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#22C997][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 196th edition of the HF News, today we're here with 'Sin.

Could you explain to the readers what your previous name was and why you changed it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Sin:[/b][/color][/url] My previous username was Tom. I changed it because I wanted a change and didn't want to use any special characters.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#22C997][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Yesterday it was your [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4249219]birthday[/url]. Did you enjoy yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Sin:[/b][/color][/url] I did for the most part. I went to my grandmother's house and enjoyed the sun. Once I got home I checked that I had over 1,000 private messages. It was crazy!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#22C997][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] That is quite a few private messages. Are you still working through them all at this time?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Sin:[/b][/color][/url] I got through all of them last night. 1n9i9c7om made a script that would send messages every 30 seconds.

To anyone who is scared or feels lost, I am always here for you. I know what you are going through and want to help you with any problems.

I have only been in it for a few days, but I can tell each member in the group is a good person. They genuinely care about each other.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#22C997][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Joining 143 is quite an accomplishment. Do you have any future goals you'd like to accomplish on the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Sin:[/b][/color][/url] I can't really think of any. I want to continue to help wherever I can and put a smile on everyone's face. There is nothing better than that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#22C997][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed.

The database was made up of encrypted text, which included name, address, password, e-mail, of the users. No cases of the stolen data have reportedly been used yet, but it is still extremely important for people to change their passwords there. The company also says that it has no indication that any financial data was leaked yet, \"The company also said it has no evidence of unauthorized access or compromises to personal or financial information for PayPal users. PayPal data is stored separately on a secure network, and all PayPal financial information is encrypted.\" A good sign for people who use PayPal with this service. \n\n[color=white][b]Mining Information from School Students[/b][/color]\nAccording to Knewton, a leading security firm, education is by far the largest data industry. Every day children's keystrokes, searches, and works are being collected and sent off by installed software by the schools. The data collection isn't all bad though, as through analysis people are able to study the way students learn. It can show trends in a student's ability and work, which correlates directly to hard data. For example, it can show that someone may work less in the afternoon, or that they are better in a certain subject. This is a truly great thing, and helps to further society; however, what crosses the line with respect to a child's right to privacy, especially in a classroom? The truth is, even though big companies like Google have gotten caught, there isn't that much focus on stopping people from collecting data on children. A serious problem for many security conscientious parents and students alike. The school districts don't do much to help either, according to the report: \"Districts frequently surrender control of student information when using cloud services: fewer than 25% of the agreements specify the purpose for student information disclosures, fewer than 7% of the contracts restrict the sale or marketing of student information by vendors, and many agreements allow vendors to change the terms without notice.\" The whole idea is pretty new to most, but it is nonetheless frightening at the same time. \n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nSummer time is coming. What does that mean? It means a vast amount of free time for many, and a new season for malware. I advise everyone to take the beginning of this season to hunker down for a day and secure all their accounts and computer. If you don't already change your passwords on a regular interval, now could be the time to start, or at least give it a change now. Remember good password choices and not to use the same password for everything. Make sure all your software is up to date, and your computer is as automatic as possible for security. Then run out that door and enjoy summer!\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Willy: The Billion Dollar Bot[/color][/b]\nIn the months leading up to the demise of Mt.

After a deeper analysis of trades and user data, a user created [url=http://willyreport.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/the-willy-report-proof-of-massive-fraudulent-trading-activity-at-mt-gox-and-how-it-has-affected-the-price-of-bitcoin/]The Willy Report[/url], which analyzed the behavior of the bot, and determined that the bot may have been in part responsible for Bitcoin's rise to $1000, and the subsequent crash due to the creation of unsupported value. \n\n[b][color=white]India's Rupee Declines as Importers Purchase Dollars[/color][/b]\nAs the month comes to a close, and India's importers start purchasing USD, pressure mounts on the rupee, especially due to the Memorial Day holiday causing scarcity on dollar inflows, thereby increasing the value against the Indian Rupee. This dip brought the Rupee down 0.4%, from its strongest point in nearly a year, with further declines predicted. \n\n[b][color=white]The Future of Bitcoin Philanthropy[/color][/b]\nBitcoin and its associated altcoins are more and more tools to contribute to charity. It has become possible to move money across the world in seconds, for nominal fees, and help people in ways never before imagined. Whether it be Bitcoin100's push to help charities accept Bitcoin for donations, or Dogecoin's $50,000 Doge4Water push, these coins are working to improve charity with innovation. Not to mention enabling anyone to be a philanthropist as easy as ordering a pizza, or sending money to a friend. \n\n[b][color=white]Gay Marriage May Bolster Economies[/color][/b]\nFollowing Philadelphia's legalization of gay marriage, The William's Institute at UCLA wrote an analysis of the potential effect gay marriage could have on the economy. E. G. Fitzgerald's and M. V. Lee Badget's analysis of US Census data suggests that in the first three years, the spending boost could create up to $92 million in spending in the economy, and nearly $6 million in tax revenue. This could lay an economic argument for future states' path to legalizing gay marriage, notwithstanding the existing religious and philosophical arguments.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Mind Alteration Device Makes Flies Sing and Dance[/color][/b]\nScientists from the Vienna University of Technology have developed a thermogenic device that can control flies. This device, called FlyMAD, focuses light and energy at a small point on the fly's body and analyzes the animals' brain cell activity. Using this new technology has granted scientists deeper understanding of the role of two neuronal cell types and has allowed them to use this new information to control the flies. In the past, it was not possible to control the fly's neurons, but with this new device, the team has overcome that barrier. This new technology has opened many doors for not only further understanding into how the brains of flies work, but it has also revealed many opportunities in developing similar devices to control other animals. \n\n[b][color=white]Personal Judgments Swayed By Group Opinion, but Only For Three Days[/color][/b]\nAccording to new research from the Association for Psychological Science, personal judgement does seem to be affected and is changed to fit a group's norm, but the effect will only last about three days. The effects of peer pressure have long been established in psychology, but how long the effect lasts and to what extent does the effect go to has always been questioned. In addition, psychologists have always wondered if a majority of people would rather have private acceptance but social rejection or vice versa. In the study, subjects would change their opinions and choices after seeing a large group pick differently from them; however, it was also found that these peer pressure effects lasted roughly three days. While it is currently unknown why exactly it's three days, the team plans to investigate it as a neurological effect from the pressure.\n\n[b][color=white]Women With Diabetes 44% More Likely To Develop Coronary Heart Disease Than Men[/color][/b]\nA study from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes with more than 850,000 women has revealed that women with diabetes are 44% more likely to get coronary heart disease than men with diabetes. The data used in this study goes back more than 50 years and studies over 25,000 coronary heart disease incidents. While the exact reason for this is unknown, many different options are being reviewed. One possible answer is the difference between men and women's BMI, which was found to be almost 2 units higher in women at the time of diagnosis. \n\n[b][color=white]One molecule found to block pain and itch[/color][/b]\nResearchers at the Duke University have discovered an antibody that blocks the sensation of pain and itching in mice. The antibody works by targeting voltage sensitive sodium channels in the cell membrane of neurons. Voltage sensitive sodium channels control the flow of sodium ions through the neuron's membrane. These channels open and close by responding to the electric current or action potential of the cells. The antibody would close this channel, making it much less sensitive to pain. The team is seeking a patent for the antibody in hopes of grasping the interest of pharmaceutical companies. They plan on beginning studies in order to see if this antibody could work safely for humans.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Smog Eating Cement's First Use[/b][/color]\nThe Milan Expo is set to open next year, and the main building will be that of engineering genius. The Palazzo Italia, the building in question, which will be designed by Nemesi & Partners, will be a self-sustainable building. The building itself will generate its own electricity, cutting down a bit on costs. Not only that, but the building itself will be made to clean the air around it. It will do this by using photocatalytic cement, which is concrete mixed with titanium oxide. The material will come into contact with ultraviolet light, which will then in turn make the titanium oxide react with nitrogen oxide, converting the pollution to a salt that is washed away easily. The Expo will not be happening until next May.\n\n[color=white][b]Isoscope Shows You Where You Can Go In Less Than 10 Minutes[/b][/color]\nIsoscope is a handy little map which shows you short commute times around your area. The map uses intervals of 2, 4, 8, and 10 minutes to show you where you could go in your city. It takes traffic info, and day of the week into account when it shows you the area you could explore. This could be useful if you need to go to places within a close vicinity to where you are. There is also a pedestrian option for when you aren't driving and want to walk somewhere.

Quite a few engineers came up with a solution to this, by trying to replace politicians with a software essentially. The software in question is a polling platform called PlaceAVote, and it is quite a unique way to solve this politician problem. Of course you have to be there to put your vote in, but this could mean big things for future elections if this is actually put into place. If the candidates in PlaceAVote win, they would have to get a private key code out to their constituents, and also use an identifier for each person to log in to the system. This would make security a top priority. While this idea is cool, it is hard to say whether it will be a success or not.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

The comic is the official Halo Comic and takes place after the events of Halo 4. The cover hints that the Didact has survived and that it is responsible for Master Chief's visor cracking. In the issue 7, which was released last month, it describes the event found on the cover, “The Fall of New Phoenix”—eight months ago, an attack on Earth left seven million dead, including the family of Spartan Gabriel Thorne. Today the city has been opened from quarantine, and Thorne is going home to see what’s left . . . and what it has to do with the Master Chief.” This describes the events and deaths that occur at New Phoenix, all caused by the Didact's composer which is essentially the end of Halo 4. The city is opened up, and we find out what it has to do with Chief. In Issue 8 we are shown Master Chief shooting a Sniper Rifle, and it appears that he has the broken visor. We learn that these events occur right after the story line of Halo 4. The future holds with the next edition, Issue 9. It is theorized how Chief may have broken his visor and suggests and pretty much confirms that the Didact has survived and has also broken Chief's visor. While the story after Halo 4 is told in these comics, it doesn't mean we will have the same story in future games. This makes us wonder how much we will see at E3 and how much can be speculated about the plot. It appears that the Didact isn't dead and still kicking.\n\n[color=white][b]Destiny Updates for the week of May 25, 2014[/b][/color]\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Competitive Multiplayer Detailed[/b][/color][/size]\nBungie.net user USplendid compiled a list of lots of things that have been announced about the competitive multiplayer so far. With E3 just weeks away, we should be getting our first looks at Player-V.S.-Player combat. It is a surprise on how much information is actually available already. Here is a list of the things already announced.\n\n[list]\n[*]Destiny’s competitive multiplayer will not be capped at 3v3.\n[*]Competitive Multiplayer must be unlocked by playing \"at most a couple hours\" of campaign and PvE.\n[*]You carry your weapons and gear into all modes, including PvP.\n[*]Competitive Multiplayer is played on separate maps made specifically for PvP.\n[*]PvP is not emergent. (You cannot ambush or force players into combat.)\n[*]Halo's \"run and gun\" style of rushing to find players and put shots on them without consequence is counterproductive. As dying effectively gives Supers to the other team.\n[*]Success doesn't come from twitch skills alone.\n[*]Destiny will never reach a final level of balance.\n[*]Everything in multiplayer is designed with a counter in mind.\n[*]Certain weapons can only be earned in competitive multiplayer and vice versa.\n[*]You can change your loadout mid-fight, but the mechanisms that Destiny has in place will discourage you from doing so.\n[*]Unlike in Halo, weapons are not found on the map.\n[*]In place of that system we have ammo drops. \n[*]Ammo management is VERY important.\n[*]Ammo is divided into three generic, color-coded categories that correspond to the three weapon slots. Primary, Special and Heavy.\n[*]The \"speed\" of gameplay varies from activity to activity, mode to mode\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Release Dates for the Week of May 25 2014:[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]Watch Dogs - PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One - May 27, 2014\n[*]The Sly Collection -  PlayStation Vita - May 27, 2014\n[*]Mario Kart 8 - Wii U - May 30, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Notable Gaming Threads and Events[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]\n\nInterested in having your gaming event or thread posted in here?

The console releases, namely Xbox One and Playstation 4, feature bigger worlds and greater rendering distances, as well as all features from previous releases. Though, Mojang plans to release the game at $19.99 USD, those who purchased Minecraft for the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 can upgrade their copy to play on a next-gen console for only $4.99, a reasonable price for those looking to play using the newest hardware. Also, those who purchase the PS3 or PS4 version of the game can play it on the Playstation Vita for free. On the Xbox and Playstation, saves can be transferred from an older console to an upgraded version; however, cross-platform play unfortunately isn't possible. While Mojang hasn't specified a release date, those eager to play on their new consoles can expect a release within the next few months.\n\n[color=white][b]Snapshot 14w21b[/b][/color]\nThis week's snapshot consists of bug fixes, optimizations, and more bug fixes. The changelog, taken from Mojang's website, reads as follows:\n[list][*]Bugfixing.\n[*]Optimizations.\n[*]Notability intensified.

A video posted by Rodger's on YouTube announced \"...tomorrow is the day of retribution...the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity.\" The day after, Rodger committed mass murder near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus in the Isla Vista neighborhood. In total he killed 6 people. Other clips were uploaded to Rodger's YouTube channel indicating his motivation in this was his loneliness and the lack of compassion girls had for him. Some other videos were titled: \"Why do girls hate me so much?,\" “Life is so unfair because girls don't want me,” and “My reaction to seeing a young couple at the beach, Envy.\" It is reported that Rodger first stabbed his three male housemates before jumping into his car and killing three others. After being injured, Rodgers crashed his car and when police went to detain him, he already had a gun-wound to the head; the act was likely self-inflicted.\n\n[color=white][b]Chinese Tycoon Sentenced To Death[/b][/color]\nChinese tycoon, Liu Han has been sentenced to death for \"leading mafia-style crimes and murder.\" Liu was among 37 others who were charged for a similar crime, and the sentencing is believed to be a part of a crackdown on Zhou's Yongkang network. Zhou is currently under investigation for corruption and abusing his position as security chief. The courts decision was influenced by corruption, financial gains via illegal activities, and committing murder in an organized fashion. The sentence and case raises questions over China's government, and the sentence could lead to a criminal proceeding for Zhou himself which could be the biggest case in China's communist history. Liu was ranked 148th on Forbes' list of the richest Chinese business people in 2012 and used to be the former head of Sichuan Hanlong Group.\n\n[color=white][b]Far-Right Gains Momentum in Euro Elections[/b][/color]\nFar-right parties have been gaining more support in what one prime minister calls a political \"earthquake.\" The far-right National Front won the elections in France with 26% support, or 4.1 million votes. It is also suspected that the UK Independence Party (UKIP) are being seen as clear favorites in the ongoing European elections in the United Kingdom. The most significant win in the elections so far was Frances', where party leader Marine Le Pen announced that the results were: \"the first step in a long march to liberty.\" UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, also said \"I don't just want Britain to leave the European Union, I want Europe to leave the European Union\" which neatly ties together what many of the Eurosceptic groups are trying to achieve. More news on the total results of the votes next week.\n\n[color=white][b]Somalia Parliament Attacked[/b][/color]\nIslamist militants from al-Shabab attacked the Somali pariament in Mogadishu, leaving at least 10 people dead. Al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaeda, once controlled large areas of Somalia. A car bomb exploded outside the parliament gates shortly before 9:00 GMT, which was followed by bursts of gunfire and more blasts. The attackers then stormed the front of the parliament building as security forces fired back. Police were joined by the African Union Troops as they engaged the attackers. Several militants and at least four police officers were killed. The Somalia parliament is a frequent target for Al-Shabab.\n\n[color=white][b]Oldest American Celebrates[/b][/color]\nThe oldest living American is one of the few living people that was born in the 19th century. Jerlean Talley is the world's second-oldest person according to a list maintained by the Gerontology Research Group. Jerlean Talley was born on May 24, 1899. The oldest is Misao Okawa in Japan, who is 116. She was born in Montrose, Georgia. When she asked has she lived so long, She told the Detroit Free Press: \"It's all in the good Lord's hands. There's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\n[color=white][b]UK Is Facing Fresh War Crime [/b][/color]\nThere is a lot commotion going on in the UK this week. Over 833 Iraqi civilians have accused UK soldiers of abuse. This is not the first occurrence of a detainee abuse report from Iraq. There has been multiple reports as far back as 2003 regarding abuse and torture of the detained civilians. This is a just another alarm in the UK to change their interrogation policies. Iraqi detainees described their experience as traumatic extreme torture and beating. The minds of the Iraqi detainees were overall scarred with violence.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ndzWS1q.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Wiz Khalifa Arrested[/b][/color]\nRapper and known marijuana user, Wiz Khalifa, was arrested for marijuana possession in Texas. He was on a plane from El Paso to Dallas and the TSA found the drug in his luggage. He's been making light of the situation by posting 'selfies' and updating his twitter from behind bars. Wiz made this statement \"I wanna drop 28 Grams but they got me locced up. Soon as I get out, the tapes comin out.\" We can expect a mixtape release upon his release from jail and an album in the near future.\n\n[color=white][b]ZZ Top's 45th Anniversary [/b][/color]\nThe legendary rock group, ZZ Top, is releasing a career compilation: \"The Very Baddest of ZZ Top\" in light of their 45th anniversary. An exciting album comes with an exciting track list. The 2-disc set includes all albums with the exception of La Futura. Alternatively, the single disc includes tracks from Rio Grande Mud, Tejas, XXX, missing, and La Futura. What better way to celebrate than to put their history in one compilation album?\n\n[color=white][b]Will Ferrell, I mean Chad Smith?[/b][/color]\nChad Smith, drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and actor Will Ferrell faced off in a drum-off on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. These known people are also known to lookalike; they even embraced it by wearing matching clothes! There is no question about who won this drum off—the pretentious Will Ferrell!
