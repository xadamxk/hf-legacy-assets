Effective immediately, all weekly reports between the former and current week's marked closures will be merged into the imminent edition's thread, for a more 'looking-back' approach to the HF News with the comments detailing the week's current happenings. The system has not changed, it has simply been moved. However, we will no longer be accepting unrelated posts which includes informing others their report already exists, or participating in an unrelated conversation. In other related news, we have released a new sticky entitled [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4735087]HFNT - Suggestions[/url] for you to suggest new ideas and changes for the HF News.\n\n[b][color=white]Wiki Finally Released[/color][/b]\nAfter three years of constantly interrupted development, the Wiki finally made its debut on March 10th, 2015. Members were pleasantly surprised to see \"Wiki\" now part of the main menu strip. The recently retired Member of The Month's sub forum was moved to Suggestions and Ideas, and a dedicated Wiki Talk section was added to accommodate. Wiki leaders have saw fit to update manually with contributors submitting corrections and new articles through a private message, although promising contributors may be invited to the Wiki team. Their reasoning and methodology has been fully explained in the official release thread which can be viewed [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4724861]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]HFNT Releases its Own Unofficial Wiki[/color][/b]\nDissatisfied with the Official Wiki's direction, a small group in the HFNT joined forces to create what they felt was the correct implementation of a Wiki: one that is maintained by the community. After two weeks of rapid site development and content creation, the alternative Wiki became ready for release. Any Verified member is able to make corrections and updates as they please, with a team policing the updates for authenticity and quality. More updates are to follow shortly and may be found in the launch thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4734026]here[/url].\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ycJz7ej.png[/img]\n\n[yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-_E-DK4zM[/yt][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/sc5xchY.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#EFEFEF][b]Justin Timberlake[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation points.

What's up man?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] Hey! Nothing much really, just got home from a day outside skiing, watching some White Collar right now. How about you?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm just enjoying the great weather and my few days of spring break. Any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds good. Yeah I'd like to give a shoutout to all the nerds in Nightfall! They know who they are.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Nightfall seems like an interesting group. What would you say makes it stand out from other groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest the fact that it is so laidback is the biggest pro. I can be myself and say almost whatever I want and have a decent discussion about a lot (such as, but not limited to games, tv shows, movies etc.).\nThe group also has a lot more activity than most other groups. Not that I've been in a lot, but judging from the ones I am / have been in, Nightfall's activity beats them by far. I've also been in there for almost 8 months now, so I know most of the guys in there pretty well, and they're really chill.\n\nNightfall is a place to relax without feeling you have to do this or that just to avoid being kicked from the group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I definitely agree. In your opinion, what is the most important thing a group should have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] Activity.\nI used to be in the group Studio, it had a lot of chill members and a lot of potential, but because of the absence of activity, the group turned to shit very quickly. Left the group just before it changed into AnimeFAN. Chill members is also a necessity imho.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, seems like certain groups are struggling to maintain active subforums. So what got you started on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] I joined HF back in 2012 because I had just found out that Keyloggers and RATs existed. I later stopped using them, and started selling a couple PS3 modding services in the marketplace just to make a quick buck. I went inactive between ~December 2012 and January 2014. I don't remember why I came back but after coming back, I realized that HF was filled with a lot of cool people and I suddenly gained some friends, and that is the reason I'm still here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] What's the most valuable thing you've learned in your time here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest I don't feel I've learned quite a lot from the forum, learned a couple things in the SRPP section or in Void relating to science, but I haven't really tried coding, computing, graphics or anything like that. I wish I did though, because there are a lot of knowledgeable members on HF that I'm sure could help me out. Been really busy with school lately, but I might be getting into C# (or anything really) soon, thinking about applying for Debug for that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I've wanted to get into coding as well, maybe I'll see you there! So what do you do outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] That'd be cool. \nWell like I said I've been really busy with school work lately, but other than that I mostly play games, drink or just hang out with friends, watch movies/tv-shows and I work out when ever I have the time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Console or PC? And what sort of games do you usually play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] I play GTA V, Destiny or any of the AC games on the PS3/4, but as of right now I play OSRS most of the time with the Nightfall squad. I also play Minecraft occasionally, but that almost stopped after HC died.\nI used to play a lot more than I do now, but I guess I've grown a bit tired of gaming.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah you tend to burn out after a while. If you could be Omni for a day, what's the first thing you'd do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] I'd absolutely try to implement two-step authentication as soon as I got the chance, I feel it's something almost the entire HF community wants\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That would be a great addition, it's been requested by tons of people. Anyway that's all the time I have. Anything else you'd like to say before we wrap up this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1284627][color=white][b]Dean Winchester:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for taking the time to interview me!

Welcome to the 231st Edition of the HF News. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Shout out to Understalker, Echo and Specialists... and you of course!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Aw thanks. So, what got you started here on HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, like many others I came here because I wanted to get revenge on somebody, a game server to be precise. Although shortly after joining I realized it wasn't as simple as that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] It seems like you learned a great deal in order to come to that conclusion. What part of HackForums / Who helped you come to that realization?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Well actually after realizing it wasn't so simple, me and a friend hired somebody to do the job for us, they taught me a decent amount about the scene, they've since been closed for blackhat activity though, so I wont mention any names.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. During your initial month or so on HackForums, what sections in particular did you enjoy visiting? How did these sections affect your overall experience on HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Ah, it was quite a long time ago now, but I've gotta say I probably lurked around the beginner hacking section for awhile back then, to be honest it didn't help me a great deal, but it definitely made me realize there's more to ''hacking'' than you ever think.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Was there anyone in particular that helped you begin to learn how to hack here on HackForums? Any important or helpful threads?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Although it was me that introduced HIM to HF, Understalker has been my daddy for a few years now, pretty much everything I know is because of him, which doesn't make me look that great.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Let's digress from HackForums now. Are there any hobbies or interests you partake in apart from being on a hacking forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'm a lazy bitch in real life, I used to take a lot of drugs and listen to music, but now I just stick with the music if you know what I mean.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Would you care to expand on what music genres you particularly enjoy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty much everything, but my favourites would be good hiphop/classic UK dubstep/deep house (shoutout to Hannah wants).\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Moving on, what is your opinion on groups within HackForums? How have they influenced you, and have they influenced you in any way?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, right now the groups are just for the leaders to have  some money invested somewhere, nobody REALLY gives a shit about them anymore and it's quite sad. Not that I have a solution for this, but i'm trying to think of something fun / worthwhile the official groups of HF can get involved in, aka some sort of contest group vs group style, but we'll see. When I didn't know much about HF groups where pretty intimidating, but now I see that they honestly don't mean that much once you're in one or two.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] What type of group would you personally like to see emerge on HackForums, seeing as you're clearly discontent with the ones that are currently on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] I really enjoy the notion of the black hand (unofficial group), a group that actively does something for the community. While I preach that groups aren't really useful anymore, I'm also a hypocrite because Echo isn't doing anything great right now either, but it's definitely the number one lounge group right now, overly (and I mean overly) active Skype chat, quite a few business opportunities as well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of business, how have your businesses been going along on HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Very well actually, my ebook was a great success, twitter cracker is going quite well too, I've just released a new homework service which has had a few requests already, (shoutout to Arkzabor and carc, some of the very talented individuals that are working with me on that). I'm still looking out for more opportunities though, pretty much anything.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] How has the HackForums marketplace impacted you, and how much have you earned from selling on it so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Its impacted me in a positive way, and I've learned a lot from it, how to properly get your products out there etc. From me directly selling on the HF marketplace, I've probably earned around $4k, minus sticky costs. But I've also had my fingers in other peoples pies.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] What have you done with the money you've earned?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Well, mostly I just save it, I have what I would call an investment fund that I keep to invest into more projects. Just kidding, who do you think I am? I gamble most of it and the rest I spend on Domino's.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#FFA500][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Unfortunately, we've run out of time here haydrazs. Any last comments before we end this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=892404][color=white][b]Haydrazs:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, thanks for interviewing me, and also keep up the good work. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

He first ran into issues when he realized that USB is actually fairly well-protected. If you short the power and ground to one another, the USB port will simply shut off. If you pass a high amount of voltage through the USB, the transient voltage suppression (TVS) diodes can mitigate the energy. DarkPurple used an inverting DC-DC capacitor which allows for high voltage and high amperage. The capacitor will charge to 110V (Direct Current) and instead of shorting the power and ground wires, it sends this high power through the data pins of the USB which is enough power to defeat the TVS diodes. This will allow them to fry sensitive internal components and often the CPU itself since USB is usually integrated with the CPU in most modern laptops. This attack is highly effective and can render a PC unusable, often permanently.\n\n[color=white][b]DRAM Exploit ~ Gain Root Access by Calling Memory[/b][/color]\nA recent vulnerability in physical DRAM memory has come to light. It affects both DDR3 and DDR4 and can easily lead to an escalation in privileges. DDR memory is laid out in rows and columns. When a row is accessed multiple times, the surrounding rows around it lose a bit of voltage. If this is done enough, the bits can be 'flipped' (1 becomes a 0, and a 0 becomes a 1) when the memory is refreshed and re-charged. In its most simple form, row hammerings occur when someone allocates a large chunk of memory and picks two memory locations within the same bank to repeatedly access, which will cause the individual cells within the memory to interact electrically with the cells around them, causing them to 'flip.' This has been used to create a privilege escalation exploit by flipping bits in Page Table Entries (PTE's). A Page Table is a data structure used to map virtual memory, which which processes can interact, to physical memory, which is physically on the RAM. Changing the PTE to point to a physical page that contains a Page Table of the attacker's process, allowing the process to read/write that memory. This exploit has also been used to escape sandbox environments.\n\n[color=white][b]Three Arrested for Largest Data Breach in US History[/b][/color]\nThree defendants have been charged over what may very well be the largest data breaches in the history of the United States. Two of the defendants were Vietnam citizens based in the Netherlands and one is a Canadian citizen. They have been charged with stealing well over 1.5 billion email addresses. Quoc Nguyen, 28, and Giang Hoang Vu, 25,are being charged with hacking into several email service providers and stealing billions of peoples' account information and subsequently providing it to the third defendant, David-Manuel Santos Da Silva, 33, who used the data for large-scale spamming and other nefarious reasons. Although Nguyen is on the lam, the other two hackers will be sentenced shortly for computer fraud and hacking.

This version of Android has many new features but what has caught the eye of security-savvy people all over the world is the addition of “Device Protection.” Device Protection will allow a user to remotely lock, delete data, and even freeze the device in the case it was lost or stolen. A factory reset is all you would need to get the phone back into working order. Device Protection is an automatically-enabled feature when you set a screen lock and link the device to your Google account. Once you do that, your Device Protection will be set up and now will allow you to take care of any theft issues you may face in the future.\n\n[b][color=white]Newly-Formed EU Anti-Terrorism Unit[/color][/b]\nOver in Europe, there has been a proposal  put in place by government ministers at an EU Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting which would create an Internet Referral Unit which would control Europol. This unit is modeled after CTIRU, the Counter-Terrorism Internet Referral Unit, and has the task of dealing with extremist and jihadist content on the internet. Social media and smartphones are creating issues and allowing these extremists to spread their information however they like. With the creation of this new unit, there is hope that these people will not be on the web spreading their misinformation much longer.\n\n[b][color=white]Apple’s ResearchKit: Possible Hacker Gold Mine[/color][/b]\nEarlier in the week, Apple announced ResearchKit, an open source framework that allows medical researchers to go through and gather data from iPhone apps. Much have already been added to Researchkit like studies on certain cancer survivors, asthma patients, etc. The main worrying issue is that the medical industry is not ready for the new cyber security age. Personal health information is constantly being searched for by hackers yet they spend very little time increasing security towards it. The data they will be gathering can also be accessed by hackers if they have the knowledge to do so. This has yet to be seen but only time will tell.\n [/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/5rkrHO0.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=981500]Premortal[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1864779]Red Sоx[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Playstation 4 Update 2.50 Adds Suspend/Resume and Other Features\n[/color][/b]Members of the Playstation MVP Program have access to a beta version of the Playstation 4 firmware update 2.50.

It'll be multiplatform.\"[/url] While the original [i]Titanfall[/i] was released solely on the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC, its sequel is slated to appear on Sony’s Playstation 4 as well. \n\n[b][color=white]Release Date for the Week of March 13, 2015:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]FleetCOMM: Operation Vigrior - PC - March 9, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]DmC: Devil May Cry - Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox One, PS4, PC - March 17, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Battlefield Hardline  - PS3, PS4, XB1, Xbox 360, PC - March 17, 2015 \n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Final Fantasy Type-0 - Xbox One -  March 17, 2015 \n[/list]\n\n[align=center]Gaming Video of the Week \n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odzKEGe_iuk[/video][/align][/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/0JDiCTX.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \n\n[b][color=white]CISA Cybersecurity bill; The reincarnation of CISPA[/color][/b]\nCISA, also known as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, has been passed with a vote of 14 to 1. It is meant to allow businesses share more private information with governments than ever before, but also puts them in charge of monitoring more than ever. The bill also gives the government more access to its citizens without a warrant, and would give them permission to investigate cyber crime by means of detailed surveillance. \n\n[b][color=white]Microsoft Cortana Becoming Multiplatform[/color][/b]\nMicrosoft announced that they will be releasing Cortana on Android and iOS in addition to their own phones and Windows 10. This is part of a new strategy from Microsoft to be everywhere instead of only on their own OS. Cortana is one of the first AI programs for mobile devices and it is expected to be great competition for everything else available, including Siri. \n\n[b][color=white]Shadow-less Skyscrapers Are the Future of Buildings[/color][/b]\nArchitects are redesigning the future of Skyscrapers at NBBJ, an architect company based in Los Angeles. The company wishes to build skyscrapers that do not interfere with human lives due to psychological effects the big cities often have on people due to constant shadows. The buildings will have a strange shape and will use mirrors to bounce the light from one building to another to make it seem as though there was no building in the way of the sun at all. The mirrors will be diffuse mirrors according to NBBJ, which means they will not burn people or hurt people's eyes. This is definitely interesting and will be something to look forward to in the future. \n\n[img=500x500]http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Courtyard-View-FEATURED-1024x724.jpg[/img]\n[size=xx-small]Photo Credit: NBBJ[/size]\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
