Site owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] contacted Google as soon as the issue was brought to notice, and everything is now resolved. It seems that Hack Forums was labeled as a harmful site due to a rouge ad network possibly attempting to infect members. It is believed that this HF pandemic had a minor affect on the site's traffic, mainly in relation to newcomers, but the regular visitors seemed relatively unscathed. To view [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s thread on this matter, click the following link: http://goo.gl/WFHrg\n\n[color=white][b]Hack Forums blocked Microsoft emails[/b][/color]\nAfter the ordeal with Google and it's malicious website notification, it has lead to Microsoft noticing the issue, and resulted in MS flagging HF's domain MX record IP. This, in result, will disallow members from receiving emails from the site. This also means that members can't receive register confirmation emails or password recoveries. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has stated that he is working to fix this issue, however it may take multiple days, since Microsoft is known to be less punctual in comparison to other companies when it comes to customer service.

As a customary, any shoutouts for your fellow HF members? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Yupp, shout outs to Yellows, SoulZeh, Positive, Soulmate, Pocky, yourself, and all other friends I've made here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for the shoutout, and I'm sure all of the others will be happy to see their names up there as well. Why don't you enlighten us on what brought you to HF, and kept you here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: I first joined HF last May because all of my friends kept talking about it on Xbox Live. Naturally, I wanted to see what it was all about so I made an account. Back then selling/trading Xbox Live GamerTags was pretty big, so I started doing that for a while. I've made good money off that and have been here ever since.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Good to see that HF's promotion market extends even off of the web. How does one go about obtaining XBL GTs, are there any tricks to sales, and how did it feel when you first tried to enter the HF Marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Oh gosh, back then it was hectic. This was before the rule where only l33ts/ub3rs could make threads there was made. But a lot of jacking/stealing accounts occurred. It was much easier, now Microsoft's security has improved greatly. As for tricks, having the most post active thread in that section sure helps. (Almost 400 posts)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Haha, I'm sure it does. Some, Rhythm members in particular, would be aware that you recently were promoted into a leadership position for Rhythm. How has this position taken affect on you so far, where do you think it will take you, and why do you think you were offered the position in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Let me first say it's EXTREMELY stressful. I've noticed and others have too, that I'm more stressed out recently. I've been keeping up with the group and trying to improve it to the best of my ability, but I'm getting a lot of heat from other members about it. Where do I think it will take me? I'm not sure yet, only the future knows. And I believe I was offered the position because of my activity within the sub forum and the friendship I've made with many of the members there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Well, hopefully you continue to do great work in such a challenging position. As some of your closer mates would know, you browse HF mainly from an iPod. Why, and how, do you use an iPod regularly and still have a decent wad of quality posts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, actually. I've made over six thousand of my posts solely off my iPod. The main reason, I don't have a PC. Well I didn't, I actually got one a few days ago. (8/27) But dedication. I love being part of HF's community, and to do that, I have to post one way or another. I'm so glad I finally got a PC though, no more iPod. It's funny actually, I've yet to download Skype so I'm doing this interview off my iPod as we speak.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Definitely describes dedication. Tell us about yourself, just in general.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Okay, I'm mostly a gamer. Halo, CoD, etc. But more recently I've veered off from that road and mostly browse HF and do stuff outside of the Internet. As for my gender, I'm a male. I know a lot of you thought I was a female for whatever reasons you may have heard, but no. I can assure you, I'm a male.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I see. You're too lame to be a female, Saturday, so I don't know why anybody would think that. What things would you change about HF if you had the chance?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Lol, funny. What would I change? Hmm, good question. I can't think of any major changes that NEED to be made. Possibly a moderator of the GamerTag section/Appraisals and Pricing. Staff, hit me up. lol. But other than that, and all these new groups that recently came out, nothing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: While we are on the topic of changes, what about the HF News? What are your views/opinions on it, and how do you think it could be improved?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: I love the news. I make sure to check it out every week. I like being filled in on the bans and notable accomplishments and whatnot. I don't think it needs to be improved. I enjoy it just the way it is.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Great to hear... What do you think is an appropriate age for voting, drinking and smoking, if you think there is any age when it is appropriate?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: I think the age for voting is adequate. You really don't start thinking about who you really want running your country until you're out oh high school and you're more mature. As for drinking, I believe it should be raised a bit to at least 25. How many stories do you hear about college kids getting drunk and doing crazy things? Smoking, never. I recently lost a loved one due to lung cancer last May from smoking and it devastated me. I don't like the idea of it at all.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: There will always be discussion on the topic, and making a globally accepted age would be close to impossible. I'd like to thank you for joining us today Saturday. Any final thoughts/comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks so much for interviewing me, man. Can't wait to see this week's edition. Bye.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337]Tibit[/url][/font][/size][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Welcome to the 107th full edition of the HF News, Tibit! As a customary, we usually let members give any shoutouts to their close friends or partners. Have any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: Sure, I'd like to give a shoutout to Existence, SoulZeh, Phegget (Yellows), Airon, Angrybrit, Glassy, +Awesome, and Baked.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I'm sure that all of those members will be happy to see their names up there. How were you originally introduced to HF, and what were your intentions?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: At first I joined HF when searching for sites to do research on when I was preparing for a Cyber Security Competition known as USCyberPatriot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I see. That kind of thing must require a detailed knowledge of network security, and coding. What languages do you know, and how did you originally learn things (excluding HF) about coding? Why did you decide to learn to code?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: The competition is pretty easy to be honest. I created a vbscript with a co-worker that does majority of the work for us, the only thing that is hard, is finding other people with interest and knowledge of basic security principles to assist. Hopefully my book that gets published in December will make it easier for others to learn the basic security principles. As for coding, I mainly study web-development (PHP, Html, etc), but now I am focusing on C++ for my class work while Majoring in Computer Science.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Sounds interesting. As most would know, you are the owner of Empire. How is the group going, and what are your future plans for it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: The group is going well, we were more active than even Rhythm for quite awhile there even though they had 150+ more members than us, we are limiting the group size to 40, we currently have 36. However, school starting up for most and I, myself, moving away to University has slowed activity. We are increasing it once again and have well over 13,000 posts in the group (the post counter is broken for it so it should be around 15,000 - 16,000). In the near future we will be making several changes. I have just chosen to switch up our leadership team with the addition of SoulZeh and Existence along with the removal of Hades. We will also be allowing members to apply via a recruitment thread this week. \nThe recruitment thread is up and can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=2829663][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I see. Hopefully the group is impressed with whatever you have planned. While we are on the topic of groups, what do you think makes a good/successful group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: A successful group is one that meets it's goals as set by the group's leadership, and a good group in my opinion is one that is active and has a strong bond between the leadership and the members, those two traits alone is all a group needs to be able to meet it's goals.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Most definitely. How were you able to scrounge together the funds for Empire?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: The co-leaders had raised some of it, but the majority is out of my pocket, mainly through sales of my software and other products. The group will be paid off shortly. I also have quite a bit stored up from competitions and consultiing jobs I've done over the last month or so.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Great to hear. What are your plans IRL, if you don't mind sharing, for the future? Are you planning on taking up a profession in the computing/programming field?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: I currently am co-authoring a book on Corporate Security and work for a private firm doing Cyber Security Consulting for clients. I plan on continuing work related to that field and getting my Doctorate in Computer Science.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Sounds interesting. Does being the owner of a group affect you at all? Has it slowed you down, or heaped stress onto you, hence having an affect on your work or life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: Not really, it has been more fun than stressful. It does take a bit of work, but the members are great and I have a dedicated team assisting in the day to day management of the group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: A dedicated team must help with the workload. The name [i]Tibit[/i] is quite a unique one. Is there any kind of story or personal meaning behind it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: It has been my IRL nickname for the last 7 years. The story of how I got it is a bit long so I won't go into that, but it stuck and I like it. Almost everyone that knows me calls me by it, even my co-workers and some of our clients.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Haha, that's an interesting one. If you had the ability to reform or change some things on HF, what would they be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: Only things that come to mind is better group management tools, adding the group Power that was announced last year, and implementing the vouch system. The site doesn't really need much changing, just improvements and updates from time to time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I agree. Well, thanks for joining us for this edition of the HF News Tibit. Any final/thoughts comments before we wrap it up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: Nope, thanks for having me. Enjoy your evening.\n[/spoiler]",

The man, while intoxicated at a NFL game, was cheering Tennessee's second touchdown, when he fell over the 33-inch rail, and landed on another level of the dome. The clumsiness of the man, and arguably the dangerous circumstances of the facilities, resulted in his own death, as well as the hospitalization of another, of whom he landed on. The injured man was treated and released for seemingly minor injuries.\n\n[color=white][b]Hurricane Isaac Batters South-East US[/b][/color]\nAfter wreaking its havoc against south-eastern US, and various islands around the US, Hurricane Isaac comes to a halt. The hurricane battered homes and locals, as it swept through, causing an estimated $3 billion worth of damage, and various fatalities. The natural disaster has resulted in 41 direct, and 3 indirect, fatalities. The disaster has taken affect particularly on New Orleans, which 7 years after the devastating Hurricane Katrina, is left with yet another battering. Waters mounted to over 3 meters, and high-grounded places which have never flooded in a hurricane, have been hit with a storm of reality. \"I suppose we can never take enough steps to be safe,\" stated a shamed local of Louisiana who refused to evacuate.\n\n[color=white][b]Neil Armstrong Passes Away[/b][/color]\nNeil Armstrong, globally renowned astronaut, most prominently recognized as the first man to step foot on the moon, passed away late last week. Armstrong underwent heart-bypass surgery early last month, just two days after his 82nd birthday, and over 40 years after making the history books. As commander of Apollo 11, Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. He was the first human to complete such a task, and aided by his mission crew including Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, he had marked a huge technological milestone in mankind. His trademark words \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\", describe honorably the lasting contribution that this mission has made.\n\n[color=white][b]Blue Moon Stuns The World[/b][/color]\nEarlier today, a blue moon wowed the world by showing off its beauty. This rare event won't happen again until 2015, when there is two full moons in the same calender month. This event occurred on the same day as the private service for Armstrong, and is a true tribute to his life and death. Armstrong's family has suggested paying tribute to Neil by \"looking at the Moon and giving the astronaut a wink.\" The legacy of Neil Armstrong shall live on by the Cosmic calender.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Amazon[/b][/color]\nAlong with Amazon's announcement of two new Kindle Fire tablets later this month, one would expect that Amazon would've implemented a larger model, perhaps 8-10\". Those who have seen the product, although, say quite the contrary. It is rumored that the new versions will only be a slightly improved version of the current Kindle fire, and will only be 7-inches! With the iPad Mini's launch approaching rapidly, it's crucial for Amazon to continue their success in the tablet business. Amazon has definitely taken a few interesting steps in accordance with the expectations, one of which is the Amazon App Store for Android. Amazon has made the decision to launch this project so that users can directly download apps from Amazon, rather than both Amazon and its users relying on Google Play. Some say it's a smart move, but it's definitely a risky one.\n\n[color=white][b]Pirate Bay[/b][/color]\nGottfrid Svartholm, infamous co-founder of The Pirate Bay, was arrested by Cambodian authorities on Thursday. The reason behind his arrest currently lies in the hands of speculation. Meanwhile, Gottfrid Svartholm's lawyer stated \"As far as I understand, it is because he is on an international wanted list.\" Earlier, when Svartholm was arrested in Sweden, he was asked to attend an important hearing. Svartholm produced a medical certificate in rebuttal, which stated that he was unfit to attend trial on the given date. He had not attended the consecutive hearings arranged by the Supreme Court, and now faces a finalized 1 year jail sentence, along with a fine of $1.1 million. \n\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nFollowing a successful lawsuit against the multinational conglomerate company Samsung, Apple has decided to continue their rein. Apple Inc. has filed another lawsuit, located in the same Northern California court as the previous, against the same company! This lawsuit, filed by an Apple insider, revolves around a case presented earlier this year in February. The case involved a number (17) of Samsung devices violating Apple owned utility patterns. Apple has already achieved success in banning the sale of various Samsung devices in the US, including the Samsung Tab 2.0, but the financial communication giant just won't stop there. With this accusation taking a new route, Apple stated that \"Infringing Samsung products include at least 21 new smartphones, media players, and tablets that Samsung has released, starting August 2011, and continuing through August 2012.\" The list includes the Samsung Galaxy S3 among the many.\n\n[color=white][b]Facebook[/b][/color]\nSocial media mammoth, Facebook, has released plans of deleting pages with fake likes. They said that they want page likes to be genuine for Facebook users, and to truly represent the popularity. In order to ensure this, Facebook has taken a couple of lunges, and has implemented an improved automated system that is designed to find pages with suspicious likes, and to neutralize them. Facebook was successful in their research in relation to this issue, and has found out where a majority of these fake likes originate. Facebook believes that these suspicious likes are generated mostly from countries such as Egypt and the Philippines, and are mainly associated with a company known as \"Virtual Bagel Ltd.\" Facebook believes that around 5-6% of its accounts could be fake, which ultimately results in around 54 million fake Facebook profiles!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbjo5C8ZAaCfSc.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Lupe Fiasco: Chief Keef Scares Me[/b][/color]\n\"Chief Keef scares me. Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents,\" Lupe Fiasco told Baltimore's 92Q. \"Specifically in Chicago. And I don’t speak this about any other city because I’m not from there. But, like, my family lives in Chicago. So my nephews, my cousins, my friends and my peoples, they all in those hoods that he represents. When you drive through Chicago…The hoodlums, the gangsters, and the ones you see killing each other. And the murder rate in Chicago is skyrocketing and you see who’s doing it and perpetrating it, they all look like Chief Keef.\" \n\"I understand where he came from, and I understand his struggle and I'm not [mad] at him, I'm [mad] at the place that he came from and that places like that still exist and incubate that mentality,\" he said.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of The Week:[/b][/color]\n[spoiler]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvNhsWMU0c[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][b]Member Submitted Videos:[/b][/color]\n[spoiler]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOAwbazzKQ[/video]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkeUFRK4i7w[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nSometimes you will just get screwed in life, and there's nothing you can do about it. You can try to gain alliances and save yourself or fix the problem, but sometimes, it just happens without any warning and without any possibilities of salvation. The only real thing you can do is keep your dignity and enact any revenge possible. This may not be what you were told, but you just need to save face and kick ass. Truth.",

But being 26 you \nneed to be responsible as well so i will definatly make sure there is plenty of protection\n(condoms). It is quite hard being this handsome because every girl you have 1 nighters \nwith want to settle down, but because im getting on now i need to pick one soon and \nmake a few r0flez jr's. Im looking forward to every world cup (football/soccer) that comes \nalong as well, so hopefully in the future England will become better and eventually win 👍 \nThe only thing im not looking forward to is all prices going higher and higher, if thats the \ncase then im living with my parents and being a party animal for the rest of my life \nwoo hoo!\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=548259][i]-r0flez[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"What do I look forward to?

We will \nnot get any farther in some fields because of our government. They keep secrets, control us, \netc. The thing that pisses me off the most about our government however, is that they could \ncare less about our citizens anymore. For example, look at that asshole Mitt Romney. He put \nthat one company out of business and over 100 jobs were lost, but he didn't care because he \nmade a couple million dollars. If we want to make a difference in the world, I fear this might be \nthe only way.
