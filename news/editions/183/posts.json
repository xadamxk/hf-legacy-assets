Members farmed away at hundreds upon hundreds of inventories full of carrots, potatoes, cake, reeds, and more in order to aquire enough EM (Eco Money) to afford the shiny little graphic on their profiles. Those who felt that the effort was too much would buy it from dedicated players for a sum that usually outpriced normal donation awards. With the hype of the award and the server growing a little cold, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] decided to revamp the possibilities by removing the chance to get the old green award and instead allowing players to strive for the new HackerCraft Purple award. Priced at 100,000 EM, only those with the greatest plantations will be able to obtain it in a reasonable time period, yet all the while risking their precious base being found by the heartless raiders always present on a faction-enabled server such as this. Avoid the raiders, set up an efficient farm, meet new people and simply have a wonderful time; join play.hackercraft.net.\n\n[color=white][b]Hearthstone Section[/b][/color]\nA newer release by the popular video game development company Blizzard, the free-to-play game Hearthstone has captured the attention of many gamers around the world. Following a strategy card based gameplay model, the object of the game is to play different cards to summon beasts, conjure spells, and command the various heroes of the Warcraft realm in epic duels of strategy. The game has gained the interest of many members on Hack Forums as well, causing website owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] to add an additional section under the already existing Battle.net forum in the Gaming tab of the main site navigation. Members who wish to visit the new section to discuss the game itself, tactics, tutorials, or other aspects of the game may do so by visiting it here: [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=311][b]Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Omnicoin Developments[/b][/color]\nThe official cryptocurrency of Hack Forums has received a major overhaul in the past few weeks. Development of the coin has been taken over by the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1088934][color=#EFEFEF][b]Crypto™[/b][/color][/url] and his team. In the subforum dedicated to the coin, [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=310][b]Omnicoin[/b][/url], new information and project updates are posted in a rapid yet efficient manner. With this new leadership, however, some may be disappointed to find that all current Omnicoins will soon be considered worthless as a relaunch is planned for the coin, meaning that the current blockchain will no longer be the official one. The exact time and date of the release of the new version is not yet known, but updates can be followed in the relevant section. The stickies in the section include important information, such as how to safely get ready for the new blockchain by removing the old wallet and datafiles. As [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has stated multiple times, Omnicoin is planned to be integrated into the forum somehow in the future, so keeping an eye on the subject would be advised.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft XBOX Sales Disallowed[/b][/color]\nEver changing, the rules of Hack Forums have received a new addition to [url=http://hackforums.net/misc.php?action=help&hid=21][b]Disallowed BlackHat Activity[/b][/url] this week with the addition of the new Microsoft XBOX sales ban. According to the updated Help Documents, the sales of XBOX products such as the XBOX one console, games, XBOX Live points and even MS Points are now considered an offense punishable by a closed account. According to the threads posted about the change, it is thanks to the heavy amount of fraudulent deals concerning the XBOX products in the Marketplace. This is a major change, as there was previously en entire section dedicated to the subject. Unlike most rule updates, the announcement threads were immediately closed, not allowing members to reflect their opinions of the change because the it is simply not up for discussion. The announcement threads can be viewed as follows: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4075296][b][Rule] Xbox One sales BANNED[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4075303][b]Xbox Sales Banned[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4075307][b]Xbox Products BANNED[/b][/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j0VfbyrNSaTvM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=805825][color=#EFEFEF][b]- Sam -[/b][/color][/url] has reached 2,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#EFEFEF][b]630[/b][/color][/url] has reached 24,000 posts.

Today we're interviewing Saturday. Any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, shoutout to Yellers, eiqht, Sir, Animer, Clerk, Lights, and Jesus (God's son). \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Nice list, I know those guys well. So tell us about why you're getting interviewed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well, originally it was going to be these lesser known members, but none of them responded to me in a timely manner. I took it upon myself to get this edition done one way or another. I admit though, I feel right at home though talking to myself.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's unfortunate. So tell us about how you found out about HF.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well it was like late 2010 or early 2011 and my buds, Cloudy, A$AP, and Soulmate told me I could sell gamertags here on HF. One thing lead to another. Here I am. I'd also like to add I still frequently talk to each of those members today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Most members sign up for you know, hacking stuff. This is HF after all. Ever get into hacking things?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Other than trees in minecraft, no. I used to watch one of my friends mess with his slaves late at night, and wanted to get into that, but was worried about legal issues and whatnot. Plus I have no idea how to set up a RAT and don't have enough time to spread ect.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see. Well moving on, you're a member of the Writ3rs. How's that going?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty good for the most part. Sometimes people think it's funny to troll us in the news editions without offering any insightful criticism and that's annoying. The workload is pretty easy as well. I find it relatively easy to get my interviews done on Saturday or Sunday (really the only time I have to do them) which gives me a lot of free time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So what are your thoughts on the new Non-Free Accounts section?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I could care less, honestly. I really only see MC accounts in there that are obviously from dumps, but to each is own. I think it's cool Omni is giving the community what they want. I just hope they don't abuse it. Like what else is supposed to go in there? Spotify? Netflix? People have been giving those away for ages.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Good point, Sat. So I might as well ask, what's the deal with the Lights obsession?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I don't really see why people call it in obsession? I mean, people have their usernames as celebrities and I don't go that far. I enjoy her music and she's genuinely an awesome human being. I guarantee if you researched about her more than meets the eye, you'd be hooked. That along with good music? That's like the perfect combo. Boom.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm quite fond of Lights as well. I run a Lights blog ( http://lightsarmy.org ) too. Have you checked it out?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I run that blog too. It's pretty rad because the Lights Army (Lights' fandom) is a unique group of people who for the post part spread her positivity around the net. Plus she just had her baby about a week ago and she's releasing a new album this year, so there's a ton going on in the Lights part of the internet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Moving on, if you could change one thing about HF, what would it be.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Bad question. Pass.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Okay, well explain the real Saturday. Behind the computer screen.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Corgi connoisseur, HF enthusiast, overall boring person. My social life is less than exciting, so I spend a lot of time on HF, that's not to say I don't have friends and whatnot. I'm actually quite popular in my group of friends. The fact I have to reassure you that I have friends sounds desperate, huh?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Little bit. Also the fact you're talking to yourself.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=white][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url]  The end.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Hey, Chief dude man.

It's doing pretty good from what I've gathered. Just grinding, ya' know. Any shout outs before we begin though?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes, 360. That's nice to hear. And quick shoutout goes to you Clique for interviewing me. Anyways, I'd also like to give a shoutout to following members, Corso, Diabolic, Paradoxum, Havoc', Aura, Emylbus, Bugga <3, and much more. (These were just on top of my head)\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True. Hi Corso! Anyways, tell us about you. What's up? What do you do.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url]:[/b][/color] I do a lot actually, I won't go in depth but I am taking classes under the IT field, like many other members here. And I play sports as well, Basketball and sometimes football. ;)\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Interestin' stuff mane. Tell us about what you do on here. WHH section? I know you're active there.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url]:[/b][/color] I don't do that much actually, I just help in the white hat section and you know cleanse the mess that is always erupting in that one section. But you know, this is just me.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Stayin' busy at least. What's one of your favorites things on the forum, though? Just curious \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, it has to be the amount of members we have. Everything is active, if you are seeking assistance in a particular topic then there will always be this one member helping out. Whether or not it may not be the best assistance provided, but just knowing that someone is knowledgeable in the field is great.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] No lie. What's your honest opinion of the news? Anything that we should add or something like that?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url]:[/b][/color] The news is definitely one of the best additions added to HF, alongside MRT. Everything is fine, just one thing I cringe is those delays. I wonder if Sir sometimes has an understudy? Someone who is willing to post those topics whenever Sir himself is inactive or busy.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sir is the only guy who can publish the official version of the news, sadly. That'd be great to have sometime whenever. So -- what do you want to be once you're out of school?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1536004]Chief[/url]:[/b][/color] Alright, that's understandable. Anyways, I've had dreams of becoming an astronaut, that is my dream job. But that is something I can't just grasp. I needed a more realistic goal for me, and somewhere between the lines of Software engineer seems to suite me the best.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Nah, dude. Shoot for the stars man!

Any shotouts you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Folds, Kangaroo and Omni because they are cool.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Tell us a little about how you stumbled onto HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Ok, so basically one day I was looking for Minecraft hacks, somehow found HF and the Minecraft section and made an account, from that day on I was on HF doing whatever it is I do exactly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What exactly is it you do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Well, I am currently training to become a chef and I try to help out members on HF, have a little bit of fun and read threads basically.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's cool. What's your favourite dish to cook?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] I like to cook a variety of different things but I would have to say my favourite would be nachos because who doesn't love nachos?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] A chef who makes nachos, of course. So do you have any interests in computers? Or are you here for the kicks?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Oh, well as a young child I picked up a machine running Windows 98 and spent many hours of my life trying to draw with MS Paint which all turned out to be lines and circles, since then I have attempted to build my own rig, helped people with their computer issues, fixed multiple machines for some quick cash and am trying to get someone to teach me to code in java. I got into trouble a few years back for hacking my school and shutting their network down to which I have been offered 2 jobs for recently by a man who owns his own IT company and by an ISP/Mobile provider here in Australia called Vodaphone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Are you currently employed? If so where do you work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] I am currently employed by a Cafe, it is called Cafe Horizons and I do minor chef work, help out trainees and stuff like that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, so what would your favourite thing about HF be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Well, I spend a majority of my time posting in the Lounge or in one of the various gaming sub-forums so I'd probably say that, and as for why? I just like to post, if someone has an issue and I can help I'll gladly do so and if an opportunity to \"troll\" presents itself I'll take it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What would you like to see HF improve on in the future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Well, the reputation system is one thing I think we can all agree needs to be improved on, but mainly everything is pretty good right now. Omni just needs to push out some of the stuff he's been talking about for some time now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Thanks for joining us for this interview, do you have any closing statements?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=867295][b]Dragnite:[/b][/url] Hackforums is a nice place with a good community and excellent staff, keep up the good work.

You can now play your favorite GBA game on your iPhone. The app was completely redesigned with a ton of new features, including skins, Dropbox sync, cheats and other features in customization. \"GBA4iOS 2.0 was designed from the ground up for iOS 7, with the goal of making everything not only look better, but simpler to use. Taking this a step further, GBA4iOS now has a built-in web browser for downloading games, making it much easier to start playing your favorite Game Boy Advance games. Finally, 2.0 has been fully optimized for iPads, giving Apple's tablet a first class emulation experience.\" You can download the app on your iOS device from the official website, but make sure to read the FAQs before installing. You can view the website [url=http://gba4iosapp.com/]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox Beta Program[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft is rolling out an Xbox beta program where users can test future updates before they go live to the general public. Microsoft has started inviting users to preview the upcoming March update. If you have been selected, you'll be notified through an Xbox LIVE message. If you are selected, you are asked to provide feedback in a private forum on Xbox.com. \"We're counting on our fans to share their input as we're putting the final touches on the new features that we plan to deliver in early March,\" Microsoft said in a statement. The next dashboard update for Xbox One launches in March ahead of Titanfall's release on March 11.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nWTF is Banished? TotalBuscuit talks about a game that I am very interested, which was recently launched on Steam!\n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAi5wWPDZjw[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbb0ATvLAZvxfB.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]1.8-- Just Around the Corner[/color][/b]\nGiven the constant snapshots that have been released within the last few months, it's very safe to assume that Minecraft 1.8 is just around the corner. In this update, mapmakers are being made very happy, with countless additions to the game to compliment their leisure in what they do (make maps). The update, though, isn't only for the mapmakers' benefits, but also for the common player's. New blocks, features, gamemodes, and functions have all been added into the game.\n\n[b][color=white]Large Updates to Come to Consoles[/color][/b]\nWhile showcasing their multiplayer (local) UI [url=https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/436515136447471616]in a Tweet[/url], 4JStudios has made it clear that there are villages and temples coming to consoles as well. Intentional or not, both of the aforementioned are very credential features to the game. At this point, it's safe to conclude that the console version of the game will only furthermore continue to resemble that of the PC version. That being said, this newest patch will likely be released very soon for the PS3 and the Xbox 360.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nIn the past week, both Yoshi and Robust have resigned from their moderator positions, due to a large workload on and off of HackerCraft. Currently, iNviZ is the only moderator left on the server; although new moderators are expected to be appearing in the near future. You'll be missed, guys.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]TreePunch[/color][/b]\nAfter updating from just being a prison server, Treepunch now also offers survival, creative, and parkour. Though the game types are still new to the server, they're definitely fun to play on with familiar faces and members of the awesome community. That being said, check the server out today by connecting at treepun.ch!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jRoP8j6lSgFc9.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Gay Rights in Russia[/b][/color]\nWith the banning of gay rights in Russia, President Vladimir Putin has yet another supporter of his decisions. With hate from various different people who do support gay marriage, Putin is backed up by Bernie Ecclestone. Agreeing with Putin's decisions, he states: \"He hasn't said he doesn't agree (with homosexuality) just that he doesn't want these things publicized to an audience under the age of 18. I completely agree with those sentiments and if you took a world census you'd find 90% of the world agree with it as well.\" Recently Russia is trying their best to make sure infants are not exposed to LGBT rights so it cannot spread, as stated above. With the Olympics in Sochi, anyone participating in the Winter Olympics must be straight; or they won't be eligible to participate, which definitely doesn't appear right to some. Things are going well in Putin's eyes.\n\n[color=white][b]Mt. Gox Bitcoin Price Falls[/b][/color]\nA few days ago, Mt. Gox listed their Bitcoin value as being only $100. Since then, their price has risen to $232.60 with a low of $96.63. This is currently the cheapest exchange rate for Bitcoin online. Before the drop, one Bitcoin would have cost $850, and security issues have been a huge problem. Investors were led to believe that the coin would eventually be on the edge of bankruptcy, and would soon become worthless. Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer with Bitcoin wallet states that you cannot withdraw the coins from the site. Instead, people are finding other ways to to receive the funds. Mr. Antonopoulos says “To ‘withdraw’ USD at that time, you were required to buy BTC (bitcoin), then withdraw BTC, thereby artificially pushing the price above other exchanges. This is ‘escape buying.’ This is the reason why Mt. Gox’s BTC/USD price was consistently higher than all other exchanges, until a week or so ago.\" Protesters have been storming outside of Mt. Gox's building, stating that they would like to know whether or not their money is safe.\n\n[color=white][b]Scarred for Life[/b][/color]\nWith no rude pun intended within the title, an unlucky teenager who attends David Douglas High School has recently been \"scarred for life.\" Four suspects have been accused of committing the crimes: kidnapping, robbery, assault and menacing with a bail of $3 million for each individual. On February 12, Jenna Montgomery, one of the criminals in this act, lured Dustyn Murrain (the victim) into a shed, where the assault began. The teens stated they were after his skateboard and money, which is absolutely ridiculous; considering what they did to Dustyn. What did they do exactly? They beat him in the head with a crowbar, shot him with a BB gun, and then used a box cutter to carve a swastika into his forehead. It's not clear whether the wound on Dustyn's forehead will scar. Dustyn and his mother have no clue if the cut will actually scar, and for now he has been wearing a silicon patch which will assist the healing. Quotes from his mother state, \"He's been severely traumatized not just physically, but emotionally. It's something he's gonna live with forever, especially if the scar of (a) swastika doesn't go away. Every time he looks in the mirror he's gonna have that memory.\" Very sad, very disgusting indeed.\n\n[color=white][b]Ukraine's Truce Dead[/b][/color]\nUkraine's President Viktor Yanukovych's attempted an international deal to stop all the violence between protesters and government officials. It did not end too well, and eventually ended up in the deaths in another crisis. With intense violence and protesting going on for over 3 months now, it's incredible how far the protesters are willing to go to restore order and get what they want. To state the obvious, there's no peace in Ukraine, and everything is revolving around the President and him alone. Again, reports show that people are camping out in in the Independence Square waiting for Yanukovych's resignation. On February 20th, shots were reported to be fired nearby. Who law enforcement officers were shooting at is unknown, but they for sure were trying to show a message. The breaking of the truce is supposedly the cause of the shots, but as said above, it's still unclear who the targets were. Protesters continued to pester officers throughout the day, and government snipers were given permission to shoot at anyone causing physical violence. This being said, 70 protesters were killed, and over 500 wounded. Three policemen were killed and 28 injured.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jTIISqnQV7AMM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Google And LG Supposedly Collaborating On Smartwatch[/b][/color]\nWith rumors of a Google-powered smartwatch floating around, they may have gotten more credibility.  CNET and the Wall Street Journal both claim that Google is teaming up with LG to make an android-based smartwatch. WSJ claims that other companies could eventually join in to make their own version. As of now, little is known and the companies have not made an official statement.\n\n[color=white][b]Ford Reportedly Getting Rid Of Windows For Sync Software[/b][/color]\nPreviously, Ford was using a Windows OS to power their in-car Sync software, but that could all be changing if these reports are true. Bloomberg reports that Ford could be ditching Windows for Blackberry's QNX for its next-gen systems. Bloomberg claims that using QNX would be more cost-effective and could possibly lead to improvements in the system.\n\n[color=white][b]Newegg Coming To The UK In March[/b][/color]\nNewegg, one of Amazon's biggest competitors, is supposed to be sending over to the UK in late March. This news comes as a welcome thing for most, being that they didn't really have access to the electronic store before now. The company says the launch will be soft, until they get better shipping and supply lines. Newegg is known for selling PC parts, claims to have over 25 million users registered, and they hope that the number will grow once the UK comes into play.\n\n[color=white][b]Mozilla Shoots For $25 Smartphone[/b][/color]\nMozilla has recently partnered with a new chip partner, Spreadtrum. This company may not be well known over in the US, but Mozilla decided to partner with them anyways. The reasoning behind this decision is simple: cheaper handsets. This company provides Mozilla with a low end chip for the phone, and this means Mozilla can sell the handset for a lower price. At this point, we are looking the possibility of a $25 phone coming from Mozilla. This phone is going to be targeted at developing markets, such as India.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j2bNJXw7KAGGS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Schoolboy Q's \"Oxymoron\" Leaked[/color][/b]\nShortly after appearing on a stream as he day-viewed his upcoming album, Oxymoron, Schoolboy Q has acknowledged that the album has been leaked. After [url=https://twitter.com/dangerookipawaa/status/436331251469795328]being so sure[/url] that the album was \"under lock and key,\" the artist had [url=https://twitter.com/dangerookipawaa/status/436558171801276416]come to revelation[/url] and sent out 200,000 copies of the album to vendors and retailers. He continued to post a few tweets after the incident claiming how he loves his fans and is happy that his album is \"IN DEMAND MOE THAN ANY OTHA ARTIST!!!\"\n\n[b][color=white]Controversy Regarding Justin's Pee[/color][/b]\nAfter his most recent arrest, Justin Bieber was required to take a urine test to reveal any illicit drugs in his system in order to make further judgement. As soon as the incident became public, then, both fans and non-fans rushed to try and publicize the video evidence of him giving such a test. As many claimed that such was immoral, just as many backed their doings with the \"freedom of the press\" clause of the first amendment. A ruling by a Miami judge, however, was made to seize all processing of video images of Justin.\n\n[b][color=white]She Kissed A Girl and She Liked It (Again)[/color][/b]\nWhile attending Miley Cyrus's Bangerz tour, Katy Perry got a taste of, well-- Miley Cyrus. Though it wasn't previously choreographed or planned out, Miley quickly decided upon a spontaneous act and did what she thought she needed to do. After doing so, Miley only had one thing to say: \"I just kissed a girl and I really liked it a lot.\" Not too surprising for her, but I suppose it wasn't really expected. Additionally, the pop star posted a picture of the happening on both Twitter and Instagram.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jT4JzXVrxHH7U.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n-=-=-\nDavid v. Goliath. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Even the smallest of individual can make a difference in the world. Nothing is immortal nor invincible.

Though \nthe intentions of having discussions about reports are good, the \ndiscussions going on do not contribute to the report whatsoever. \nI am always seeing people reply to reports and most of the time \nthey are not even relevant. A sentence responding to the report \nis not a discussion and I see it as post whoring. There are a few \npeople who are doing this and it is quite obvious who they are. \nWith the \"discussion\" going on it is hard to see if something has \nbeen reported or not. I think the Weekly Reports thread should \ngo back to the way it has always been, with no discussion, just \nreports and things that are added on to them. The posts replying \nto posts should be deleted or junked if they have no relevance to \nthe reports being reported.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][i]-Roger Waters[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think that although there is always more to a story than \nwhat happened, the Weekly Reports thread should be what the \ntitle says it is - reports. It should be objective and simply relay \nthe facts for potential use in the news. There shouldn't be any \ndiscussion as to whether something is newsworthy, as that \nshould already be handled by those who pick through the thread \nto report on the individual pieces. Even posts saying \"XXX has \nalready been reported\" are useless, as you obviously can't use \nthe same report more than once. It's completely useless, and \nshouldn't be allowed.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=317312][i]-White Light[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I think discussion on previous or current news editions is great \nno matter where it is as this gives the news team lots of feedback \non how they can improve for the future etc. I also have no issue \nwith users discussing the news editions in the weekly reports thread \nbut I can see how this could cause issues when finding reports etc, \nIf this is an issue for the team then I would suggest either sticking a \ndedicated discussions thread or removing posts in the weekly reports \nthat aren't reports.
