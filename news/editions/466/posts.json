Engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California were able to develop a successful new ventilator in 37 days. The new ventilator named VITAL (Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally) can be built faster and with less parts than the conventional ventilator. “We have the potential to save human lives, people that we might know, our neighbors, our families, and the intensity … is amazing, it’s amazing.” Said, Michelle Easter, a mechatronics engineer. Doctors tested a positive prototype at the Icahn School of Medicine in Mount Sinai, New York. NASA is waiting for the FDA to approve the ventilator in this emergency response.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-develops-ventilator-prototype-for-coronavirus-patients-in-just-37-days/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Amazon Under Fire[/color][/b]\r\nAmazon is no longer able to supply non-essential goods in France until the pandemic is under control, the French court ruled. They would have to close six warehouses and place all their staff on paid furlough. Amazon said that the terms they were given were not \"clear\" enough on what they should offer, so they chose to shut down operations instead of facing a chance of being fined. However, in the appeal, it says, “Amazon can only deliver items directly related to medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items in the country during the coronavirus pandemic.” This appeal came after the unions took Amazon to court for not shielding its employees from being exposed to the virus. Each item that is shipped and does not meet its requirements will face a fine of $108,000.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/25/21235964/amazon-restricted-france-coronavirus] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Facebook Is Releasing Messenger Rooms[/color][/b]\r\nDuring these days, Zoom was a hot topic for people working remotely and students working remotely for education. Facebook is now taking on Zoom calls and is launching a conference version of the popular messenger app to compete with Zoom, Messenger Rooms. Facebook has been known to take on similar features of other networks and to adapt them to their ecosystems. 50 people can be in a call at once without a time limit, although the free edition of Zoom only allows a maximum of 100 people for 40 minutes. Other features will include AI-enabled virtual backgrounds and will be able to stretch 360 degrees. Zuckerberg said that this would offer \"the next level\" experience. Rooms can be accessed on messenger on the main Facebook platform, and will be extended to their other apps like Instagram and WhatsApp.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/24/tech/facebook-video-calling-upgrades/index.html] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4570721][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/animenews-megane.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Boruto Anime to Delay New Episodes from May Onwards[/color][/b]\r\nIf you are currently watching Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, the latest spin-off in the well-known Naruto series, you will be able to recap and rewatch past episodes after May 3.

The popular streaming service will be airing the East Blue and Alabasta arcs. However, despite this good news, there is also some bad. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, episode 930 will be delayed until further notice. Without giving too many spoilers, the anime is currently in the \"Wano\" arc. This arc started last July. This is mentioned because on April 26, the date that episode 930 should have been released, One Piece will be broadcasting episode 892, the start of the Wano arc, as a rerun instead. It has not been officially stated yet, but it looks like for now, One Piece will broadcast reruns until they can dish the new episode out to you.

She was 63-years-old when she passed and she was best known for being the voice actress of Haru's mother in the anime movie created by Studio Ghibli, The Cat Returns. Additionally, she voiced the character, Jenny, from the Pokémon movie, \"Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\" and even From January to February, Okae had undergone various radiation therapy sessions after being diagnosed with breast cancer. It was said that Okae started to feel the symptoms of the virus back in April, where she had a high fever. Because of the fever, Okae was rushed to the hospital, where she then spent a few days. After spending a few days in the hospital, her sickness got worse and the doctors then diagnosed her with COVID-19. In 1975, Okae made her debut on Japanese Television, where she was one of the main stars in various live-action series. It is very sad to hear people passing away from this terrible virus, especially at such a young age too. Yes, 63 is young!

The game sold over 1,880,626 copies in Japan alone. In Japan, this sale made history, making Animal Crossing the first Switch game to have the highest number of copies sold within its first week of release. A Korean digital artist by the name of Southbig came up with the idea, \"What if Animal Crossing was an '80s anime?\" Just as Southbig thought about it, the Korean artist decided to create their very own Animal Crossing short animation. Not only will you see Animal Crossing characters like Blathers the owl, but you will see other Nintendo game characters too, like Sonic! Of course, a majority of us here cannot read Korean, so some of the little inside jokes we won't get, but it is an awesome video to watch!

A 30-second trailer was released, which can be found [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2k5g6yO-rw]here[/url]. Additionally, you can see the artwork visual [url=https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/max650x650/cms/news.3/158906/sailor-moon-eternal.jpg]here[/url]. The main cast has been revealed, and every original sailor soldier, including their voice actors, will be making a return! Furthermore, we have the introduction of a new character. This character's name is Pegasus/Helios and he will be voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, best known for his appearances as Kirito in Sword Art Online, Souma in Food Wars, and even Inosuke in Demon Slayer. Surprisingly enough, it has been 25-years since the last Sailor Moon movie was aired in theatres. While there is not much known about the film, what we do know is that it will be based on the fourth season of Sailor Moon Crystal. The story will revolve around the \"Dead Moon\" arc of the original manga.

However, the application used pirated scans, despite stating on their app, \"All manga, character, and logos belong to their respective copyright owners.\" A publishing company known as Yen Press, who are located in New York, and are an officially licensed manga and graphic novel publisher, has tried to remove the Manga Rock application off of the App Store due to all of the illegal manga it is distributing to the public. Additionally, more companies like Viz Media have requested that this app be removed, too, based on the violations. Because of this, Manga Rock did eventually remove any titles that were required from those with legitimate sources, proving that their work is theirs. We fast forward to 2020, and Manga Rock will be shutting down completely. This time they will be opening a new service called INKR. INKR will be a legitimate manga and comic distribution app this time, and the creators will be partnering with publishers such as Tokyopop, FanFan, Comic Loft, and even Tan Comics. At the moment, the application is in beta, and the good news is that not only will Apple devices get to use this application, but Android too!

Fans of the English dub will be able to watch the latest Pokémon anime in the series on Netflix, dubbed \"Pokémon Journeys.\" The anime will air on June 12 and will be a Netflix-exclusive. Your two favorite characters Ash and Pikachu, will be the main characters of the anime. You can check out the one-minute trailer [url=https://youtu.be/Ud-PtULy4gs]here![/url] The show initially aired in Japan on Nov. 17. At the moment, this only concerns Japan, but because of the virus epidemic going on around the world now, Japan is in lockdown and voice actors, and other employees are not allowed in the studios. Therefore, if you are in Japan and watching the series, you will be getting reruns, and no new episodes until further notice. As for the story, we'll be meeting a new character, \"Gou,\" which has not been translated yet into an English character's name. Gou, accompanied by his Hibunny (Scorbunny in English), will be teaming up with Ash and Pikachu. With that being said, this anime might be based on the newest video game in the series, Pokémon Sword & Shield, which is based on the location of England.
