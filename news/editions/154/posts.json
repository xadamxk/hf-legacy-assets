Whereas in the past, a replacement was found last-minute and with luck. A major benefit to this type of recruitment process is that the current Writ3rs will be inherently aware of how replaceable each member/position is and thus pushed to perform up to par. Although, it should be noted that I (Sir) am partially to blame for the decline in quality and punctuality, so I hope that these changes will remedy a long-time disease of laziness within the usergroup. If you'd like to read more on the W4TCHL1ST and/or apply to the HF News team, go check out [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3658966]this[/url] thread.\n\n[color=white][b]The Guardians Converts to Skill[/b][/color]\nThere have been several group changes this week; first off we have former group The Guardians converted into Skill. Skill is still led by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/url]. The group Skill holds the description of \"A group of gamers that enjoy both casual and competitive play. We cover multiple aspects of gaming while contributing beneficial content to various gaming sections across the forum.\" and is focused around skillful, and competitive gamers who strive to become the best.\n\n[color=white][b]Graphic Masters Changes into Fly By Night[/b][/color]\nOne of the oldest groups known as Graphic Masters has decided to change things around: the group is now known as Fly By Night. A step away from the Graphic Masters, the new group has changed their aim, they are a group that focuses in all forms of art, including media art like music production and video creation, as long as you are dedicated and passionate about your craft.\n\n[color=white][b]Prune and Post Recount[/b][/color]\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/url][/b][/color] has announced a prune and post recount has been performed. Hack Forums cleared out 300,000 posts so if you have noticed your post count has dropped, this is most likely why. This was announced via the Hack Forums Official Twitter at @HackForumsNet.\n\n[color=white][b]OMGPOP Subforum Deleted[/b][/color]\nThe OMGPOP subforum has been deleted and all posts have been shifted to The Gamers Lounge. [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/url][/b][/color] moved threads from this forum into The Gamers Lounge and gave them a new prefix, titled [Invite].

Any shoutouts to members of HF before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Well I'd like to give some shoutouts to my friends Corso and Chief. Without these guys I believe the White Hat Section would be hopeless. Also a shoutout to Infamous and all the people in there! You guys are like brothers to me :). Finally to the little WHH group that was created to chat among each other, you guys know who you are, thanks for being such great people :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Glad to see Infamous in there. :3 So first of all, what brought you here to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]It's a funny thing actually. Two things brought me to HF. The first was I was hosting modded lobbies on the Xbox 360. Basically I was making money off of this and thought I'd learn from others and my \"partner\" linked me here. Turned out, he'd be the guy to first scam me on HF. But the second reason I joined was due to me having malware on my desktop and freaking out. Thank god for the HJT team otherwise I may not have stayed :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Well that's rather lame. Getting scammed sucks, especially when it's by people you thought you could trust. 😑 Was him scamming you what made you get out of the modded lobbies business?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Indeed it was. He was my partner. When he scammed me, I took all actions to retrieve my money back and keep in mind I was 14. I escalated with PayPal and took serious actions. Once my money was returned, I shut down my PayPal account and moved on with my life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]What subjects did you take to after that? I'm sure it didn't take too long to get into your love for the White Hat Helpers section.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Well after my little incident I started leaning towards the White Hat Helpers section. God was it hard at first. I tried to help people and I just struggled. I couldn't seem to grasp a firm understanding of certain tools and whatnot and just felt like useless. Of course, I was so stubborn I argued with one of the HJT members who's one of my good friends nowadays, Shinkirou about the name of Malwarebytes (I thought it was Malwarebytes Anti-Malware). But after many months of reading threads and researching tools, I became so intrigued and interested in the subject. I loved getting on and just seeing all those questions. What was really great about it all was some of the HJT members were so proud of me and loved that I helped so much that they'd give me guidance via PM and over Skype. They taught me numerous things and also some tricks and to this day, I use them :). The old HJT team had so many nice people and they taught me everything I know :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Oh Shinky, I haven't spoken to him in a year or so. He and all of the old HJT Team members were always so helpful to me as well. I had quite a similar experience to yours when I spent my time there. What are your opinions of the MRT? Any plans to try and become apart of that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Ah the MRT team. It's quite an interesting group actually. With all the new members in the group, it feels weird not knowing them. I think the MRT is a great group for all who are interested in this field. If I recall properly, there is a fee to enter which I frown upon as there are many other sites that offer what they do free of charge. But the experience is great and poses many opportunities for people. As for me joining the MRT, I might. Currently I am training at another school which offers a similar program to MRT and it's free. I enjoy it and the environment is great. After I graduate from the school I currently attend, I may be apart of MRT with the permission of Para and TH of course. But if I can join, I most certainly will. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Yea, the fee is a bit of a turn off for many as it would seem. Though based on Para's latest thread, it would seem they're considering doing it without a fee. Do you have any other goals than potentially joining MRT?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Well like probably any other member, I'd love to be apart of Staff. I mean it's probably the most prestigious thing out there and it'd be great. Also, once I can I will be reapplying to the Alliance and their cat squad :) One other thing I want to do on here is hopefully become more helpful and ensure that everyone here is protected from malware. That's my ultimate goal.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]All very admirable goals. I'm sure you'd do wonderful with all of those, though I'm not one to speak for that first goal. Other than your obvious skills in in white hat help and malware removal, have there been any other sections or subjects you've taken interest in here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Well I've been active lately in the Computing section as a whole. I also have been looking into the marketplace and trying to understand how the people their work. In the near future I am hoping to release something that may benefit the community. Hopefully I follow through with it however :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Oh that'd be really cool! Any ideas on what type of a release it'd be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Well that's something you'll have to stay tune for my friend :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]😑 I'm an impatient being. Either way I can't wait to see what else you have to offer for this community! Are there any members here that have specifically influenced you, more so than others have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Actually, yes there are a few. Umbrein you being of them. You were my little inspiration in the beginning and still are 😉 \nAlso Tha Sneak if you remember. He taught me the majority of what I know to this day along with Infallible, Shinkirou, Verilog and a few others that have disappeared. Without them I would not be where I currently am. They guided me through all the steps and told me which tools were more complex than others. I appreciate everything they have done for me and they will never truly know how grateful I am for them guiding me. \nIt's hard to believe that I am where I am now. Took 3 years to be here. Hopefully next year is even better. Thank you to the names above for everything, it means so much to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Well don't I just feel special now. :3 Sadly it looks like our time is up, are there any last comments you'd like to say?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=393774][color=white][b]Shark™: [/b][/color][/url]Yeah! I'd like to thank everyone on HF who has helped me throughout my time here. I also would like to thank everyone in the White Hat Helper section that take time out of their day to assist others. It really shows that you care. Thank you for such a great site and I am happy to be apart of it. If you are interested in the security field of computers drop me a PM and I'll gladly assist you in finding a way to learn :) Thank you again Umbrein you have a good one <3[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178]8B1T[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Today, for the 154th edition of the HF News, we will be interviewing the member, 8B1T. For all the people who do not know, 8B1T is one of the overseers of the official group Infamous, and he's fourth in charge. Before we start, do you have any shout outs you'd like to give?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] I'm honored to be interviewed my man. I'd like to give a shout out to all my Infamous brothers, without you I don't know where I'd be. Pali and Umbrein for being my brothers the whole way through my HF days, and Kosmos for also being there to help me out. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure they would appreciate the shout out. Before being added into Infamous, what made you interested in joining the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly I had no clue of being kept within Infamous when the transition of Propitious to Infamous came around I didn't think I'd make the cut. The group was different from Propitious, and our aims were certainly not the same. Nearly 3/4th's of our group were cut around that time, and I am glad I was able to manage my member position.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'm sure it put a smile on your face when you saw the userbar. When you first signed up, have you tried to achieve any goals? If so, have you completed any?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] Of course it did. Honestly I have tried harder to maintain my activity on Hackforums. So I suppose that is currently being completed as I check up on my brothers nearly every day. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] I see. I personally think hard work and dedication pay off in the end. I know you said you're trying to maintain your activity, so what is your favorite section on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] Aside from the Infamous subforum, it would have to be the League of Legends section they always make my day, and some of them are actually really generous when it comes to y'all. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Everyone has at least one reason to why they joined HF. What was yours?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] I had no intention of joining HF at first, but my friend Umbrein had asked me to join at the time. I don't regret the decision, but it certainly has kept me online a bit more each day. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Umbrein is a nice guy. What do you dislike about Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] A lot of the people can act so witty. I'm sure everyone is different in their own way, but there's a difference between it being your actual personality, and you just being rude. I'd quite enjoy it if some of the members on the forum weren't so uptight all the time\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] I know you can't tell the whole community everything, but when you or the leaders of Infamous look for someone to invite, what would the group want in a new member?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] I can only one say one thing regarding that question. You have to be Infamous material. It's honestly what we look for in a person, and we know how to choose whether you are deemed worthy. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure a lot of people have tried to gain entry. Do you have any hobbies in real life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] Oh I think I do! I play a lot of league of legends in my spare time, and I'm also really fond of collecting anime figurines. These are honestly the things in life that can make me really happy. Just the detail on them make me so excited that makes it genuinely look like the real thing. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, I would have never known you were into anime. I am a huge fan, too. If you don't mind me asking, do you have a job?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do. I actually just got promoted that has allowed me to travel around the country in the past couple of months. I've only been to Anaheim, California, and Seattle, Washington, but it certainly is an experience. I'd rather keep it to a minimum on how much personal life information I give out though. :3 \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds like fun. I'll go back to HF related questions. Where do you see yourself in the next couple of years? Do you plan on quitting anytime soon?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] In the next couple of years.. that's honestly hard to answer. I do wish to still be friends with all the amazing people I have met here. I hope to be expecting a son in the process also. There's so many things I would want to do, but those two things would probably be the things I expect, and hope the most for. As for quitting, I don't think I will be leaving anytime soon. Infamous is forever, and I cannot leave my brothers because you know what we say, \"Long Live Infamous\". \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] I've seen numerous members with \"Forever Infamous\" in their usertitle. Do you plan on joining any other groups on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] I don't really have my mind set on any other groups, but if I had to give into joining another it would most likely be The Alliance. They're all cool cats, and I enjoy talking to most of the members. I've been in quite a bit of groups, and none of them really sparked my interest as much as Infamous has.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] I keep talking about groups, so I'll try switching it up for the last few questions. What is the meaning behind your username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] Things being 8-bit really have a genuine look to them. I just can't help but love these things so much. It was originally going to be 8BIT but that was sadly taken, so I replaced the I with an 1. :B \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#7BFF00][b]Nine Lives:[/b][/color][/url] Well, that's it for now. I would like to thank you for hanging in there with me; this was my first interview for the news. Before we end this interview, do you have any tips or anything you'd like to share with everyone?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108178][color=white][b]8B1T:[/b][/color][/url] I am honored to be the first person you're interviewing and I was glad to be apart of the news.\n\nAs for a tip I do have one. Be yourself guys, don't try to act someone you're not just for the sake of your reputation. I'd rather know you for who you are rather than what you think people would like.

Xbox Enforcement United and the Xbox Community Level are both new features Microsoft announced via Xbox Wire. The Xbox Enforcement United allows Xbox Live Members to provide their opinions on whether content violates the Xbox Live Code of Conduct. XEU is currently in beta and is only accepting Ambassadors to help with the process. However, only Gamertags can be voted on at the moment. The next new feature is the Xbox Community Level. The XCL allows Xbox Live Members to earn rewards for contributing to the community via the Ambassador or XEU systems. \"Members participate in Xbox Community Ambassadors or the Enforcement United beta, and on the backend, we track your participation, calculate your XP, and award loot to your Gamertag as you level up,\" outlines Xbox Community Program Owner Bobby Lamirande in a separate post. \"There’s no need to opt in to earn rewards, submit your activity, or create a new profile.  We’ll take care of the heavy lifting.\" The Ambassador system has also moved to the XCL website. You can signup for the Enforcement United Beta right [url=http://enforcement.xbox.com/United]here[/url], only if you are an Ambassador. \n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft Increases Xbox One GPU Speed[/b][/color]\nMarc Whitten, Microsoft VP, has announced via the Major Nelson Podcast that Microsoft have made changes to the Xbox One system since E3. The updated Xbox One system will feature a new graphics driver and an increased GPU clock speed. The changes are currently being tested internally. \"This is the time, and this is the thing I think people are going to see as we get into Gamescom and people get their first look at new things since E3. This is the time where developers have the final dev kits in their hands, they're really working closely with us on how things have come together. There's some things that have really started to come together quite well.\" \"Since E3, an example is that we've dropped in what we internally call our mono driver. It's our graphics driver that really is 100 percent optimised for the Xbox One hardware. You start with the base [DirectX] driver, and then you take out all parts that don't look like Xbox One and you add in everything that really optimises that experience. Almost all of our content partners have really picked it up now, and I think it's made a really nice improvement.\" \"This is the time where we've gone from the theory of how the hardware works--what do we think the yield is going to look like, what is the thermal envelope, how do things come together--to really having them in our hands. That's the time where you start tweaking the knobs. Either your theory was right dead on, or you were a little too conservative, or you were a little too aggressive. It's actually been really good news for us, and an example of that is we've tweaked up the clock speed on our GPU from 800MHz to 853MHz.\" You can listen to the Major Nelson Podcast [url=http://majornelson.com/cast/2013/08/02/mnr-486-marc-whitten-updates-us-on-the-progress-of-xbox-one/]here[/url].

The game was refused rating twice, even though a R18+ rating was introduced earlier this year. The game was rated MA15+ in Australia, however, the developers had to modify the game... and remove a side mission. \"insufficient delineation between the 'alien narcotic' available in the game and real-world proscribed drugs. The board notes that the label 'narcotics' is commonly assigned to describe a class of real-world drugs that include such proscribed substances as cocaine and heroin…this game therefore contains drug use related to incentives and rewards, and should be refused classification.\" A similar game, GTA 5, was recently allowed classification in Australia. It was rated R18+ (sorry kids) and will launch on September 17th.\n\n[align=center][color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nVideo Game High School is back!

Though these will probably sell out just as fast, people are still encouraged to get there as fast as they can!\n\n[b][color=white]Alpha and Beta Versions Now Playable Via Launcher[/color][/b]\nJust recently, Mojang decided to include (in addition to snapshots and other recent versions) Beta and Alpha versions of Minecraft in the \"New Profile\" field of the launcher.

The US intercepted electronic communications between senior al-Qaeda figures, which resulted in the alert. Additionally, 21 embassies and consulates would be shut on Sunday, with the closure being extended as seen fit. The US State Department said the alert expires on August 31st 2013 and it recommends that US citizens travelling abroad to be vigilant. The alert warned of “The potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure.” In the report, the New York Times says high-level intercepts were collected and analyzed this week and the CIA, state department and White House immediately recognized their significance. Many nations are taking precautions during this period, including the UK; the British embassy in Yemen is to be closed on Sunday and Monday as “a precautionary measure”. US president Barack Obama has ordered that “all appropriate steps” be taken to protect Americans in response to the threat and we await more announcements.\n\n[color=white][b]US denounces Edward Snowden’s Russian asylum[/b][/color]\nThe US says that Russia’s decision to grant Edward Snowden asylum is “extremely disappointing”. This decision has made relations between the US and Russia bitter, with the White House reconsidering a meeting scheduled next month between President Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The US wants Snowden to be extradited and tried for leaking government secrets. White House spokesman Jay Carney said “We’re extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and in private to have Mr. Snowden expelled to the United States to face the charges against him. We’re evaluating the utility of a summit in light of this and other issues.” Russia has granted Snowden asylum in there for one year. Mr. Snowden’s final destination is Latin America, but experts were unsure whether he would be able to travel abroad with the Russian travel documents.\n\n[color=white][b]US employment up by 162,000 in July[/b][/color]\nThe US economy added 162,000 new jobs in July, according to the US labor Department. However, this number was below economists’ expectations of more than 180,000. The government also cut its previous estimates for hiring in May and June. Despite this, the new jobs helped the unemployment rate fall to 7.4%, which was down from 7.6% and is the lowest jobless rate in four years. The news adds to the picture a slowly but surely growing US economy and poses a bright future for the United States.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Netflix Profiles[/color][/b]\nThis week, starting on Thursday, Netflix began rolling out profiles, a free feature that allows any subscriber to create up to 5 different profiles per account. The profiles will act as their own account, allowing recommendations to appeal to a single person's interest, as to all of the users previously. This is aimed to stop the confusion from only watching horror movies, and seeing your sibling's G-Rated cartoons appear on the recommended feed.\n\n\"The truth of it is that over the years we've really personalized for households rather than individuals within those households,\" Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, told The Huffington Post. \"Profiles is the next logical step in making personalization even better.\"\n\n[spoiler=First Look at Netflix Profiles:]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=U35oovbGEdU[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]Facebook Forces Secure Browsing[/color][/b]\nFacebook has allowed secure browsing as an option since 2011, and by 3rd qtr 2012, only 35% of users had started using it. Facebook claims to have implemented this to reduce lag from redirects via http over to https, but some are speculating this to be their quiet answer to the cookie theft happening over the last couple of years. \n\nThey are planning a move from \"1024-bit RSA encryption keys to more secure 2048-bit keys by autumn of this year.\"\n\n\"We now use https by default for all Facebook users,\" said Facebook on WednesdayThis encrypts traffic between the user's browser and Facebook's servers, adding a layer of security already adopted by Google and Twitter.\n\n[b][color=white]FBI Revealed To Have Powers To Remotely Activate Android Microphones[/color][/b]\nFollowing the start of DefCon, news has spread that shed light on the FBI using new tactics to illegally spy on users using hacking tools purchased from private vendors. As of current (Android 4.3) the FBI has \"surveillance access\" allowing them to tap into any microphone on an Android powered phone at any time. Google was questioned about this, but declined to comment. According to former officials, the group in charge of these operations is being called the Remote Operations Unit (ROU.) They are said to be using false and infected links that are allowing unaware users to install this software not just to their phones, but to their computers as well. They ensure only \"relevant data\" is stored on their servers.\n\n[b][color=white]Firefox Zero-Day Used in Child Porn Hunt[/color][/b]\nOn Saturday, an Irish news outlet reported that U.S. authorities were seeking the extradition of Eric Marques, a 28-year-old with Irish and American citizenship reportedly dubbed by the FBI as “the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet.” He was arrested on a Maryland warrant that included charges of distributing and promoting child pornography online. The exploit was found in Firefox 17, and while most users are shrugging due to Firefox already being upgraded to Firefox 22, the Tor Browser is built around Firefox 17.\n\n“Ironically, all [the malicious code] does is perform a GET request to a new domain, which is hosted outside of the Tor network, while transferring the same UUID,” Ofir David, head of intelligence for Israeli cybersecurity firm Cyberhat, said. “That way, whoever is running this exploit can match any Tor user to his true Internet address, and therefore track down the Tor user.”\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Busta Rhymes Speaks On DJ Khaled's Proposal[/b][/color]\nRecently this week, DJ Khaled proposed to rapper, Nicki Minaj. So many fans were curious because they wanted to know if it was serious or a joke. Khaled gave Nicki a 10 karat diamond ring on the MTV News studio this past week. Busta had to watch a video of it at least 30 times to understand what went on, and if Khaled truly meant it. Busta was honestly baffled when he heard about this for the first time, too. \"Absolutely not,\" Busta replied. \"I knew nothing about the Khaled proposal at the time. I definitely was surprised when he did it and I definitely rewinded the MTV piece that he did it through about 30 times because I just wanted to see if he was joking, or if he was serious.\" When Busta re-watched the videos, he wanted to believe it was actually real during each replay. He knows Khaled like no one else, and considers him a brother. He would know if it was bullsh*t, or if it was actually his true feelings towards Nicki. Monday night on a radio station, Nicki Minaj explained everything. She said she was shocked herself and that she laughed because she knows that Khaled was being serious. \"Nobody in my real life took it seriously. Everybody just hit me like, 'LOL. Yo, Khaled is crazy.' Khaled is my brother and Khaled was not serious with that damn proposal, ya'll,\" she stated. \"Please let it go. He was kidding. He's not attracted to me, he doesn't like me. We're brother and sister.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Ed Sheeran denies Taylor Swift marriage[/b][/color]\nEd Sheeran has stated that he does not want to marry Taylor Swift. Ed thought a few rumors would rise considering how the two have been collaborating a lot. Taylor has a reputation of 'singing about her relationships' so fans could expect another heartbreak song if something does happen! The two spent a large amount of time together because of Taylor's Red Tour. Ed did say he might be getting engaged with someone else, but he has not said who yet.\n\"We got the pact from Friends. We watched Friends and we were like 'oh that sounds like a good idea' but I don't really want to reproduce with you right now,\" he said.\n\n[color=white][b]From Nick Jonas To Rihanna: Shirtless Selfies[/b][/color]\nI don't think anyone has heard from the Jonas Brothers in a long time, but Rihanna is no shocker when it comes to music news. She has been skipping her concerts, arriving a few minutes late, and even partying when she shouldn't. Nick Jonas is one of three Jonas brothers. He recently has made a comeback with his brothers and he even released some pictures of on Instagram. He's been showing off his new body and how he's changed over the years. For all the girls who thought Nick was soft and sweet, he's changed quite a bit. As for Rihanna, she posted a picture of her topless, too, but of course she didn't show off the full 'goodies.' Rihanna stated that girls can do the same thing as guys, and used her Instagram account to entertain her fans and surprise them. She honestly doesn't care that she has these photos on the internet.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YcIgow6TDk[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nSome rather important events have occurred since the last edition. The HF News team has implemented the W4TCHL1ST, I won MotM, and the world seems right as rain.\nWhile those may not seem particularly relevant to you, they are some major turning points in the future of my presence on Hack Forums. The W4TCHL1ST will help keep the Writ3rs on track and on time. While there are losses included in running the Writ3rs in this new direction, I feel that it was a pivotal step towards perfection. As for the MotM success... \"fuck yeah.\" MotM was always an award that I saw go to some of the most notable and achieved members on Hack Forums. How it felt to finally acquire it for myself cannot be explained. Yet, unlike many of the others who have been voted in, I do not intend to slowly fade away and disappear into the history of Hack Forums. Stepping up for the betterment of the Writ3rs and receiving a truly wonderful gift from the community has revitalized my interest in Hack Forums. For quite a while, I've been hiding in the shadows, posting only when required or within sections that I moderated. My intention for the next few months are to reach a new peak in quality of the HF News and to post more often in more locations. Await me.",
