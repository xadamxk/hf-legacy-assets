They also differ from that of our lesser evolved brethren. This newly discovered fossilized footprint makes us reconsider much of what we previously thought about the early stages of human evolution. The fossil, found in Crete, is younger than the oldest known fossil hominin. Until the dawn of this year, all of our previous discoveries of this specific species have originated in Africa. This predates prior findings by approximately 5.3 million years. This heavily challenges the notion of Africa being the birthplace of modern humans. According to Per Ahlberg \"This discovery challenges the established narrative of early human evolution head-on and is likely to generate a lot of debate. Whether the human origins research community will accept fossil footprints as conclusive evidence of the presence of hominins in the Miocene of Crete remains to be seen.\" There are also pictures of these fossilized footprints at the bottom of the source article should you want to have a peek at them.\n[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.uu.se/en/media/press-releases/press-release/?id=3982&area=3,8&typ=pm&lang=en]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]First Sugar tax in Mexico Cuts Into Soda Sales[/color][/b] \nI may be hugely in the minority here, but I am someone that doesn't drink soda at all. Thus when I come across an article such as this one which is mainly about people substituting highly sugared beverages for water, I have no choice but to talk about it. In January 2014 Mexico put a tax on all sugar sweetened beverages sold within the country, as a way to combat the country's problems with rampant obesity. According to a study in the Journal of Nutrition, sales of soft drinks fell around 6% while the sales of water increased. The World Health Organization is calling for taxes like this to be implemented across the globe to fight the scourge of diabetes and obesity.

This game right here is not that, but it might take the world by storm. Wild West Online is an upcoming open-world MMO where you get to play as a cowboy and roam the wild west. That may sound boring to you, but in the game, you will have the ability to do possibly more than you were able to in Red Dead Redemption. You have the ability to own your farm and gather crops to earn gold, treasure hunt, and even pan for gold. It sounds like the main motive in this game is to make the most money that you can and beat other players with the items you purchase. A little bit of a GTA online system, right? In September a group of people will be selected to play the alpha version of the game. When it is in alpha, the game will have a limited amount of people on it. You may be wondering then, \"what's the point?!\" Well, the open alpha will be open to the world in October. Then, you will have the chance to play with others worldwide. Both betas will be open for a good amount of time for you to enjoy the game. Lastly, soon after the open alpha, a closed beta will be hosted. How to get access to the closed beta has not been disclosed yet.

Recently on August 29 was the release of a DLC pack for the game. Included were new outfits for characters as well as a new fighter, Menat. What makes her very special is the way that she walks.
