The issues have been resolved--for the most part--and the group has been changed to be invite only. Most of the discussion threads on the subject have been junked, but for the official Marketers thread, go [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=2209690]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]The Corporation sold to Anonymous[/b][/color]\nThe Corporation, a group owned by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063]Aeon <3[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337]Tibit[/url], was sold to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529]Λɴᴏɴʏᴍᴏᴜs[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771]Αnonymous[/url].

Not much is currently known about the group other than that the name will be 'Legion,' as stated [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3213720]here[/url]. The Corporation was formerly known as Rhythm. The price of the group is undisclosed, but the recent purchases in groups of on Hack Forums are getting higher and higher in cost. They are increasing in value, according to Omniscient, he was offered $10,000 USD for a new group, his post about it can be found [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/294586957558865921]here[/url]. \n\n[color=white][b]From Logic to The Angels[/b][/color]\nLogic was purchased by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1233686]Sandshrew[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923753]Juicy Booty[/url], who purchased it from [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752]Hexicidal[/url]. The group is being changed from 'Logic' to 'The Angels.' They've said there will not be an option to buy-in. The group will be invite only, and is expected to announce it's release, along with member invites within the next few days. The description for the group that was given to Omniscient is: \"[i]The Angels is a group of carefully selected, and highly talented members.

Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make before we continue?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: I would like to give a shout-out to a few people who have made my journey on HF a better one. I would like to shout out to Bay, Genuine, 630, BELLAGIO, Rage™, Cody, Daisy, Nathan Drake (my good friend IRL). Those are the people who come to mind first, sorry if I missed anyone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You've got some good friends. Did Nathan bring you to HF, or how did you happen to register?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: I actually brought him to HF, we are good friends in real life. I came to HF awhile ago, I came to learn how to hack and take down websites and stuff, you know, the usual ambitious expectations one has when they get into hacking. But then I stayed for the great community HF has to offer.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Did you ever learn how to take websites offline, or did you adapt to stressers and booters in the marketplace?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: I mainly just used stressers and booters from the marketplace. That was always fun.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Sounds good. What has your experience been with your groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: I like it alot so far, I have been in a few groups before but am currently in Terror, 143, and Illuminati. They are all great groups that I am glad to be apart. I like them because I can learn from them and it teaches me new ways in which I can give back to the community. I love this quote by JFK and it expresses exactly how I feel, \"My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\"\".\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: What have you learned from the groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: That to better the community, you first have to better yourself. You can not help the community if you do not learn to help yourself a bit more. I have learned that when being apart of a group your fellow members tend to look out for you and help you out, I do the same for them, that is what being apart of a group is about.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How have your fellow group members helped you out and looked out for you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: They have done this countless times, for instance when I was having problems and I was slightly depressed, they made me feel better. When I needed help learning something they were there to teach me. When I wanted to get something off of my chest, they were there to listen. They are there for you, as you are there for them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You have a great set of friends there. What kind of group projects are you involved in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: Some are confidential I believe, but I can say that you can expect alot more science related tutorials from me in the near future, and of course you can always expect free samples from me in the shopping deals section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Science, eh? That's gonna be good. How do you get free samples or products?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: Oh yes, I love science, I aspire to be a Nuclear physicist. I do plenty of high voltage exeriments and sometimes radioactive experiments at home. I get find the free samples through lots and lots of searching, it is hard work.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Explosions and free stuff. A good mix. Why do you give these things away for free instead of selling them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: It is quite a good mix :). I would rather see the community gain from the free samples than me just a single person gain from them. It is all about helping the community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: A great motto to live by. What sorts of things do you give to the community?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: Well I give my free samples as you all know, and more recently I have been doing my science tutorials on high voltage and radioactivity.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How popular are those tutorials?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: They got more popular than I ever expected them to.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad they surpassed your expectations. That's all the time we have for now; any closing comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528][color=white][b]Odin the Wanderer[/b][/color][/url]: I would like to say thank you for interviewing me, and I would also like to let the community of Hackforums that they can expect alot from me in the near future.

Any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for interviewing me Phytrix.

Firstly, why don't you tell us when and why you joined HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: I joined in October 2010 and I joined because I was initially looking for a friend of mine that I had lost contact with. I PMed him on HF and I would check every so often if he had replied and those days I would also look around the community a bit and get more into HF. I knew a bit of Batch before I joined and I found out HF had a section for that so I started posting there and getting further into the community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: That's definitely a unique introduction. Did you ever find your friend? How did you originally get in contact and how did you lose contact? Where did you go together since (if applicable)?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: I'm actually not sure if that was my friend because his online alias is r00t and I'm pretty sure that would be a common name. I got in contact with him by meeting him on a game. He told me he would teach me how to hack and program. We lost contact by him just never coming online. We didn't really do much but we would play the game sometimes. Now that I look back on it, the stuff he was going to teach me seems pretty simple.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: What programming languages do you know and why did you choose them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: I currently know Java, PHP and Batch. I learnt Batch because it seemed like a good language to start out with and it seemed simple. Batch has helped me understand the basis of programming. I learnt Java because I wanted to run my own RSPS. It's a bad start to Java but I did end up learning it from playing around with RSPS sources. PHP seemed similar to Java for me so it was simple to learn. I learnt it because I had my own domain and hosting and I thought I might aswell learn some web developement and not let the hosting and domain go to waste.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Do you have any tips for learning programming languages, or perhaps certain ones in general?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: Batch is a great language to start out with as it teaches you about the basics and it's really easy to use. There's some pretty good tutorials in the batch section if you're new to it. Alot of programming languages are the same/similar which makes it a ton easier to learn. There is no 'best language', every language is better than others at something. Stackoverflow.com is a really good place to get help and most of your question have probably been answered there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: That's some pretty decent advice. So apart from coding, what else do you enjoy doing around HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: I enjoy lurking around and reading alot of posts. Another thing I like to do is help people, usually in the PHP and Java section, although there's others that have already helped them before I can even post. But my favorite thing I enjoy doing meeting new people around HF. Almost everyone I've met from HF has taught me something or has helped me in a way.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Do you have any future goals IRL (possibly education wise)?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: My current goal is to educate my self in computer science and go to Waterloo University for Computer Science and Business Administration or any Computer Science course. I would also like to make my own game one day, it's been a dream for a while but recently I've been getting into Java game development so hopefully one day it will be a goal I can possibly reach.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Good luck with your goals. What kind of music are you into and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks. I'm into Rap and some Electro music. I like Rap because that's what I grew up listening to and everyone around me in my enviroment listened to it too. I also like the lyrics to most rap songs.I like Electro music because I just like the vibe of it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: What is it that kept you on HF in comparison to all of the other options (other forums, etc.)?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: Mostly the user base and the support. Alot of other forums aren't as developed as HF. Alot of people on HF have been supporting me and it just keeps me in the community. I also get alot of requests to do some work for people around HF so that also keeps me in the community. The best thing that kept me on HF would have to be how mostly everyone is always willing to help you so if you encounter any problems with anything there's always someone there for you.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Do you currently sell work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: I do not sell work currently. I don't think I'm good enough to be selling my work yet but if someone asks me for help I usually help them if I'm free. Sometimes people pay me when I help them but that's not too often.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=deepskyblue][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: What projects are you working on currently and for what purpose(s)?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492377][color=white][b]Dezinated[/b][/color][/url]: Currently I haev 3 projects going on. The first one would be Elyxa Stresser. I'm a stresser that's being ran by me, Skiezo and Snow. There's not much to say about it, we're hoping to be one of the best stressers out there. We offer great support and the stresser is great. The second project I'm working on is a RAT. I don't want to give out to much information out about it yet but it's going to be a PHP Rat meaning the control panel is going to be on a website. This is useful for people that cannot port forward as all the communication will be held over the web. There's currently only 3 features which are: open a website, download and execute and remove. I'm hoping to release this around mid to late February. The third project I'm working on is a social stock trading website.

Having hit three factions recently, The Company ([url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390]Rage[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=646916]Genuine[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=588904]Conception[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1262623]Sacred[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1247752]RedDotCocopuffs[/url]) lucked out with lots of loot and a couple fun raids. So far The Company has hit Corporate, Diamond and Beacon. However, following the raid on Diamond, the Company's sister faction BaySquad paid the price when they were raided by a revenge-hungry Platinum; members of Platinum were teleported into BaySquad's base and all hell broke loose as members of The Company popped in and chased away the unwanted visitors, but not before they could do damage. After breaking into the base, members of Platinum broke chests as well as armor with a bit of PvPing. Loot consisted of various enchanted items, both books and weapons, in large quantities. Threads regarding the raids on Diamond and Beacon can be found, respectively, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3192965]here[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3208837]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]The Fall of Beacon[/b][/color]\nThe Company, in the midst of their raiding streak, seem to have brought about the downfall of Beacon; shortly after being raided by The Company, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113]Dan.[/url] officially quit HackerCraft. Being the owner of the faction, he publicly stated that Beacon is now \"gone\" and that he would not be visiting HackerCraft again. This followed his decreasing activity and, according to him, was bound to happen. There has been a bit of speculation regarding how exactly members of The Company gained access into Beacon's base. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url] and his members were accused of cheating and defended against the claim that members of BaySquad/The Company flew into Beacon's base during NoCheat's downtime. These members, however, countered with their own claim, saying [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467]Morchid[/url] teleported Bay into Beacon's base while they were still allies. Dan's statement, as well as both sides of the story, can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3208644]here[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]The Rise of Planet Beacon[/b][/color]\nFollowing Dan's removal of Beacon from the HackerCraft server, he started up a server of his own. The new server, aptly named \"Planet Beacon,\" can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3166565]here[/url]. On that thread, you will be able to find their website and twitter feed.

Top it all off with the ultimate weapon in the Nanosuit and you have a multiplayer experience that is unlike anything else out there.” If you choose to download the beta, you will see two gamemodes to play out of eight in the main game.

As North Korea labels the U.S. as a \"sworn enemy\" of North Korea, the North Korean Defense Commission says, \"Settling accounts with the U.S. needs to be done with force, not with words as it regards jungle law as the rule of its survival.\" These threats seem to be at least somewhat reactive to the tightened sanctions put on North Korea after their rocket launch in December. The rocket launch was claimed to be a peaceful test, but it was later stated that, \"We are not disguising the fact that the various satellites and long-range rockets that we will fire and the high-level nuclear test we will carry out are targeted at the United States.\" Despite being an ally of North Korea, China has publicly denounced the recent statements made by the Korean government.\n\n[b][color=white]26 Die in Egyptian Protest[/color][/b]\nIt was reported that 26 people died while protesting against the 21 people who were sentenced to death for the stadium catastrophe. The disaster involved 74 people dying during a soccer match. The sentencing of these men sparked a riot that resulted in over 200 injuries and even two police stations in Port were assaulted. The protests resulted in a clash with officers, and the army was also deployed. One protester named Mahmoud Suleiman remarked, \"We want to change the president and the government. We are tired of this regime. Nothing has changed.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Afghan Police Officers Killed in Suicide Bombing[/b][/color]\nIn northern Afghanistan on Saturday, 10 police officers were killed in a suicide bombing. A little after 5 PM, a terrorist on a motorbike had ignited a sizable bomb in the north city of Kunduz. \"As a result of a suicide attack 10 policemen were killed, including the head of the traffic department and the head of the counter-terrorism office,\" stated Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, the provincial police chief spokesman. There aren't any suspects who have been identified, but the area is known to be home to many Taliban and other terrorist militants. This deadly assault came no more than a day after the Taliban launched an attack that killed five civilians.\n\n[b][color=white]U.S. Ambassador Says Syrian Regime is Suffering[/color][/b]\nU.S. Ambassador Robert Ford says that the Syrian regime is gradually starting to crumble and that \"You can hear the artillery outside the president's office.\" President Bashar Al-Assad's mother has even ran out of the country, and is now residing in the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. ambassador said, \"You can see, little by little, the inner core is weakening,\" \"But again, it's a gradual process,\" Ford remarked. He claimed that the people in the regime are slowly \"flaking off...The fighting is getting that close now to the inner circle itself. And so you can imagine what that does to their own spirits, their own morale.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1TNM2[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nApple is now letting you know when to buy new pairs of shoes. Apple announced that, embedding sensors in footwear that would track the wearer's activity and send a notification during the appropriate time to buy a new set of shoes. Apple also said that this app will not only help with when to buy new shoes, but also will help in keeping track of child activity. Meanwhile, reports says that Apple will be releasing their fourth generation iPads soon, and that it's going to be 128 GB devices with iOS 6.1 beta 5. Neal tweeted that, \"We should be seeing 128GB iDevices soon. iOS 6.1 beta 5 has 128G system partition key in BuildManifest.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Intel[/b][/color]\nIntel is to stop the production of Intel motherboards. The company has announced that for the next years, they will not be producing any Intel motherboards. However, they will continue the production of Intel chipsets for third party motherboard such as ASUS, ASRock, etc. Instead of producing motherboards, the company is about to focus its efforts on creating form factor reference designs: mock-ups that are used internally for testing, but which often also end up as the base for third-party products. So, it is expected for Intel to release plenty of new ultrabooks, tablets and desktop prototypes in the future. For this, plenty of engineers are to be pulled into other divisions instead of job cuts.\n\n[color=white][b]Anonymous[/b][/color]\nTeam Anonymous hacked a U.S. government site recently. The death of tech activist Aaron Swartz has resulted in the hacking of a U.S. government website related to the justice system. Anon posted a screen on the website saying that if the justice system is not reformed, then the cache of the government's documents will be leaked. Team Anon named this operation \"Operation Last Resort,\" and on Friday, they posted that \"Two weeks ago today, a line was crossed\". \"Two weeks ago today, Aaron Swartz was killed. Killed because he faced an impossible choice. Killed because he was forced into playing a game he could not win -- a twisted and distorted perversion of justice -- a game where the only winning move was not to play.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1TNKQ[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Chris Brown being investigated after an alleged assault[/b][/color]\nThe American rapper Chris Brown is currently being investigated after a fight broke out between him and the singer and songwriter Frank Ocean. Soon after the event, Ocean tweeted: \"got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there. cut my finger now I can't play w two hands at the grammys. (sic)\" The dispute initiated after an argument between the two over a parking space at the Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Police were alerted and arrived at the scene after the fight; however, it was reported that none of the two parties wanted to press any charges following the event. Chris has had various brushes with the law in the past - with the most notorious being his assault on his ex-girlfriend, Rhianna, which took place on the night before the Grammay Awards in 2009. As a result of that incident, he was sentenced to five years of probation, along with six months of community service.\n\n[color=white][b]UK tour announced by The Who[/b][/color]\nThe Who has said they have decided to carry out a UK arena tour in which they will perform their famous double album Quadrophenia, along with some of their classics. When first released, the album climbed to a number two spot on the UK album charts and went on the have a significant impact on the future of fashion and style in the UK. The tour will include the two founding members, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, along with Zak Starkey, who will be playing the drums, Pino Palladino, performing the bass, Simon Townshend, playing the guitar and taking part in the backing vocals, and John Corey on the keyboard with Loren Gold. The musical performance will be directed by Frank Slimes, who will also take part in the backing vocals.\n\n[color=white][b]EELS launch new video for song 'New Alphabet'[/b][/color]\nThe American indie rock group has shown their brand new video for their song 'New Alphabet,' which features in their upcoming album 'Wonderful, Glorious,' which will be released on February the 4th later this year. The video plays as a sequel to their previous video, 'Peach Blossom,' and has an important message behind it. Lately, those who occupy the younger part of society have been involved in incidents of bullying, even towards fully grown men, and have been causing concern. The video aims to speak out against such actions in an effort by Mark Oliver Everett to solve such problems. When asked to comment on the video, he said: \"Adult male abuse is a widespread but little acknowledged problem in today's society. Many grown men are victims of children's senseless bullying. I have made the brave choice to speak up as a slave of these pint-sized terrorists. I am so tired of children picking on me. It is my hope that this video will serve as the first step in opening a dialogue between victims and community leaders that will one day lead to the end of this awful abuse.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Music video of the week[/b][/color]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=SC-MO-5PWAk[/video]\n\n[color=white][b]User suggested video[/b][/color]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFGd2drY4OQ[/video]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1TNRd[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nIn light of recent events, we will be changing the HackerCraft News section into the Minecraft News section.\nThanks.",
