At this time, however, there is also the possibility of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] either selling HackerCraft to a reliable individual or renting a small server of 50-100 slots at less cost of finances and time. For those of you that wish to say your goodbyes, the server will live on for the next month without the protection of the NoCheat Plugin and with both PVP and flying enabled. To read the announcement, go [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3688111]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Possible Intentions to Sell \"Distractions\"[/b][/color]\nAccompanying [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s announcement of the impending doom of the HackerCraft server was another announcement, one of intentions to remove other distractions from his busy work-life. These distractions include the aforementioned HackerCraft, but also SupportForums and MyBBCentral. According to his post, these forums/projects may be sold off and removed from his busy schedule of administration. For members of Hack Forums, this can only be good, as more time will be relocated and intensified to our humble abode.

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] announced that being a Staff member or a Mentor is to enforce site policy, and not to handle threads that they do not personally like.

How are you doing today? Also, do you have any shout outs to begin with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Good, just working on some coding projects... Shout Out to: Dan. iNviZ ipconfig. Judge Dredd Positive\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: How did you find Hack Forums and how much time after finding it did you actually join as a member?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: I was browsing the innerwebs looking for places to learn how to hack, and make games. I came accross a couple of forums. Hack Forums, was just very active and seemed like a lot of fun. So I decided I'd join. I dreamed of being high ranked like Tibit, and a lot of other members. I was very inactive for a while, then I started learning, getting yelled at for being a skid, then I learned more, and more, until I was pretty advanced calling the members that called me a skid, a skid :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Where did you learn to master all your coding skills?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: I taught myself over years. I started with C#, then moved to PHP, and kind of jumped back and fourth. Then started doing them as I needed them, and now I kind of know everything off of the top of my head.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Did you have any goals aside from learning how to code around the time you joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Well hacking, which is actually where I started then I moved to coding, because hacking was a bit too easy for me... I had rooted about 200 servers, then got into Botnets, and did a lot of black hat. Got swatted 3 times, then I became Grey Hat, its been a lot of better road for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: As of today, what groups do you like the most on HF? Which groups do you want to join in the future and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Well I love Infamous, Complexity, and Brotherhood, Complexity is a bit inactive but it'll get better. Brotherhood is where all of my noobs are. Infamous is a difficult topic, I love the group, just don't like 1 member. I'd love to join or even make a coding group! I love Illuminati, and Legion is okay... I am hoping to become a more known HF member, though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: I’m sure you’ll get know soon enough. Your skills never cease to amaze me. Do you plan on releasing any products on HF soon?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Well, I'd love to but I can't seem to find any good ideas really. If someone wants to contact me and wants to partner up. I would gladly give it a go... I plan on doing some free stuff, I've done a good bit of Freelancing so I know I can do it, just need to get better at marketing and ideas.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any tips that could encourage people to learn to code?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Well it depends on the type of learner you're. If you're a visual learner, teach yourself. If you do better with books, then I'd say go read some ebooks. I am a visual learner, and taught myself over a long period of time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Is it worth it in your opinion? Even for someone who isn’t looking for a future in coding?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Well give it a try, and if you enjoy it then keep learning. If you hate it then its not for you. It takes long periods of time, its not something that can be mastered in a single day. You can make a lot of money with it though, I mean you can learn and it'll help with a lot of other computing things.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: ‘Nuff about computer stuff. Do you have any real-life hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: Yea, I love hanging out with my girlfriend, partying, eating :3, skating. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months, and we've been through a lot together. I love to party, Miley Cyrus baby :P, my favorite food is Pizza of course :3, and I need a new skateboard since I broke mine.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Thanks for taking part in this interview, Linux! Any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871177][b]‍‍‍‍‍‍Linux[/b][/url]: I am a open, and honest guy. Drop me a PM if you ever need help with coding just ask I will gladly do my best. I was accepted into MIT :3\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#9DFF00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Good job on that, it's quite an accomplishment!

Any shoutouts to members of HF before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]Thanks for the interview Umbrein! I would like to give a shoutout to Christy, Odin the Wanderer, Bullet., Nyx, Yellows, xrox, Clique, Chief., TheCause, Reset, and everyone from the TinyChat lounge. Sorry if I missed anyone, kind of doing this on the fly here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Quite an interesting cluster of people there. Did you meet them all in the TinyChat lounge, or have they just been people you've met and gotten to know on your ventures through HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]Just some notable people I have met through my HF journey. They are an interesting mix, but I would not have it any other way.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]They are all wonderful people from the brief (or not-so brief) encounters I've had with them all. So first things first, what sparked your interest and brought you here to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]Well, I had known of HF because I used to play Halo 3 with Apock back in the day. The whole hacking concept scared me, but after the gametags reset I came here in the summer of 2011 to sell.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Boy you must have had quite a busy gamertag shop, especially with that timing. From what I've seen, you're one of the, if not the most active member in the Gamertag section here. Now, I'm curious.. what's the significance of your name and how did you decide to use that one?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]I'd prefer to not give the exact meaning of my name out, but I'll give you the story. I used to by the name \"Collateral\" on Xbox Live and a few different Halo forums. Only downside was that \"Collateral\" was taken, so I had to do some tweaking. I had used some capitals in my gamertag so it was really spelled \"Coilaterai\", but looked like \"Collateral\". Having the name Coilaterai was annoying and after that I swore I would have something short and easy to remember. That's why I have the username 630, it is short and easy to remember.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Interesting. I'm really curious about the origins of 630 now, but I won't bug ya about it. I also see you were quite heavily involved with The Empire. Tell me about that, how did you get involved with them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]The concept was started by Detroit, Hades, and I. We had the initial $1,000 for the down payment, but the last $3,000 that we needed to pay was a problem. Detroit decided to bring in Tibit who would pay the last $3,000 and be the owner. The group was fun, but I ran into a rough patch in my life and could not carry on my leadership position.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Sorry to hear about that, hopefully everything is better or getting better for ya. Now, here's something I'm sure everyone would like to know. No matter how one looks at it and how much you or anyone else tries to deny it, you're one of the most well known members on HF right now. Any idea on how you got to reach such a level of fame?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]Thanks, life is a lot better now. I wish that I could say there is some magical formula to become known, but there is not. I have ran a few different successful shops on HF and have the pleasure of doing business with thousands of people. Being honest and polite will get you a long way not only on HF, but through life. I am a social person and am active in several sections on HF so a lot of people know me from the marketplace, upgraded member lounges, and the groups that I have been in during my time on HF. I just want to emphasize that being polite is what contributes to success most. There are too many people who act hard for being in a certain group or who have achieved status on HF. At the end of the day we are all people sitting on the computer, reputation or group status should not change that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Truer words have never been spoken. It's amazing how far a simple, \"please\" and, \"thank you\" can really get you. With everything you've done here on HF, you've obviously accomplished a ton. You've helped found and lead one of the most looked up-to groups on the forum, you've become a market place deity, and you inspire dozens of members. Are there any other goals you have on HF that you wish to accomplish?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]I do have some group related goals. I can never really seem to find one that suits me. I want to learn some skills get more involved with the groups side of HF. Whether or not that happens I will still be on here having a good time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]I'm sure you'll be able to find a group to call home. There's many different groups, all with their own little community and family of their own. Are there any groups that have caught your eye recently?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]Yes there are a few. I will always have a soft spot for 143. I think they are an awesome group and they have do so much for the community. I don't wanna kiss ass or anything, but their members do a good job. Another group that I have always liked would be the Red Lions. I wish I could of applied the last time they recruited, but I was covered in warning levels and did not stand a chance. The last two would be The Alliance and Infamous. I have no clue what either of them do, but they have both some exclusivity that I like.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Well, I can't speak for 143 or Red Lions, but Infamous and The Alliance are both like families who watch over each other. So, a bit of an out-of-the-blue question here, but I'm sure many of us are curious. What are some of your hobbies and past-times outside of HF and the internet?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]I love the outdoors. I play hockey with a group of friends a few times a week. I am a strong supporter of the 2nd amendment and enjoy shooting. I am not a hunter, but I enjoy shooting targets. My family owns property in upper Michigan, so I also enjoy fishing, going out on the ATVs, and snowmobiling. Other than that, I enjoy kicking back with friends, firing up the hookah, and sipping some brews.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]Oh wow, so social and outdoorsy. Not what most would expect from such a prosperous member of a hacking forum. Sadly, it would seem our time is up here. Thank you so much for taking your time to answer my questions, 630! Are there any closing remarks you'd like to say?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630: [/b][/color][/url]I would just like to thank you for your time Umbrein, I am grateful for the interviewed. Also a big thanks to the news team, you guys bust your ass every week and do a great job. Keep it classy and have a good one.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Umbrein: [/b][/color][/url]And there you have it folks. That was a wonderful interview with the illustrious member, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=white][b]630[/b][/color][/url].

The console features a 500GB HDD, Blu-Ray Drive, IR Blaster Port, HDMI input and output, three USB 3.0 slots, and a Kensington Security Slot. Microsoft changed their stance, and has now included a headset in the box. Other accessories include a HDMI cable rated for 1080p, 3D, and 4K, a power brick and other miscellaneous cables. If you are expecting any redeemable codes, they will be with the console manuals. The Xbox One is set to launch in November,  however, an exact release date has not been announced. You can watch the unboxing video below.\n\n[color=white][b]$1 Million Saints Row 4 Package[/b][/color]\nSo, does anyone have $1 million to spend? If you do, Deep Silver has announced a $1 million Saints Row 4 bundle called The Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition. You'll be purchasing the Command In Chief version, along with a day of spy training, a trip to space with Virgin Galactic, a one year membership to Super Car Club, a Lamborghini Gallardo, plastic surgery,  a shopping spree, seven nights for two at The Jefferson Hotel in Washington, a hostage rescue experience, a Toyota Prius and a seven-night stay at the Top Royal Suite at the Burj-al-arab with flights for two. Crazy! Saints Row IV launches on August 20th.\n\n[color=white][b]Battlefield 4 Multiplayer Details[/b][/color]\nDICE has shared new information about the upcoming game, Battlefield 4. Four kits will return to the game; Engineer, Recon, Support, and Assault. However, these kits will specialize their role even further than previously. \"Looking at Battlefield 3, I think only a fraction of our players have tried all available gadgets or vehicles in multiplayer,\" lead multiplayer designer Thomas Andersson said. \"Of course you don't have to use everything in the game, but I think we can do a better job in BF4 of letting players make more educated choices in their kit loadouts and combat roles.\" \"In Battlefield 4, we're clearly displaying what gadgets can do for you, how different weapons compare, and how they affect your options on the battlefield,\" he said. Andersson also revealed a field upgrades concept, which are similar to specializations in BF3. \"The idea behind Field Upgrades is to give individual rewards for squad based team play performance. You earn them through squad scoring such as squad healing, completing objectives with your squad members, squad resupplies, squad repairs, and other squad actions,\" Andersson said. Battlefield 4 launches for 360, PS3 and PC on October 29, with next generation releases soon after.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nCheck out the official Xbox One unboxing from Xbox.\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbrmAsxJPv4[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Minecon 2013: All Sold Out![/color][/b]\nIf you haven't already bought your 2013 Minecon tickets from Mojang themselves, it's time to start searching eBay or CraigsList as the tickets are all sold out. As promised, they had three waves of 2,500 tickets for people to try and grab them, but unfortunately (and as expected), the tickets sold out almost immediately after the wave started. Tickets are now being sold on eBay and CraigsList anywhere from $200-$500. If this says anything, it's that you better act quick next time!\n\n[b][color=white]MineCon 2013 Being Streamed as Always[/color][/b]\nAs always, during the expected event, Mojang will be setting up a stream for those not lucky enough to purchase tickets. The stream will cover any main event and will fill people in on what they missed out. Mojang stated that once the stream is over, panels will be available on Youtube for viewers to watch at a later date. They're definitely looking out for people on this one.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]After getting tired of having their stuff stolen in a rather big faction, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][color=white]Cody‍[/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][color=white]Lovol[/color][/url] made a new faction called \"143\" that is expecting no one else but just them in it.\n[*]The popular faction, Wolves, was raided.

More than 60 people have been reported dead. Eleven bombs targeted both Shia and Sunni areas of the capital, Bagdad, attacking cafes, markets and restaurants in at least nine different districts. This Ramadan in Iraq has been one of the most deadly in years with more than 670 people killed and 170 injured. This holiday season in Iraq doesn’t seem so peaceful.\n\n[color=white][b]Riot at Greek Migrant Detention Camp\n[/b][/color]Greek riot police have been deployed to end a riot inside of a migrant detention facility north of Athens. Many detainees threw stones at the police guards, at least 10 were injured. The riot began when the detainees were informed that the maximum time they could be held at the facility had been extended from a year to 18 months. Approximately 1,500 migrants are kept under guard at the Amygdaleza. It is said that 95% of undocumented migrants entering the European Union arrive via Greece, and because border patrols make it hard to continue into the rest of Europe, many immigrants end up stuck there.\n\n[color=white][b]Obama Promises Reform of Surveillance\n[/b][/color]President Barack Obama has promised “appropriate reforms” to guarantee greater oversight of the controversial US surveillance programmes. At the White House news conference, he proposed “safeguards against abuse”, including amending legislation on the collection of telephone data. Obama also urged appointing a lawyer to challenge the government at the nation’s secretive surveillance court. Obama also talked about the US-Russia relationship at the moment by saying there is “the occasional collision” and “challenging moments.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also acknowledged problems, but said Moscow preferred to handle their differences like “grown-ups”. However, the two countries have agreed on the need to convene a Syrian peace conference in Geneva, Switzerland as soon as possible.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Wearable Tech Makes You Smarter by Zapping Your Brain[/color][/b]\nAs of today, wearable technology can track your sleep patterns, give directions, and measure your heart rate. But now, this technology can make you momentarily smarter! The Focus headset, made for gamers 18 years or older, uses a technique called tDCS, for transcranial direct current stimulation, which is a brain stimulation method that involves sending very low amounts of electrical current through various parts of the brain to achieve different effects. Recent studies have determined that minor stimulation can have positive effects on healthy brains. For example, shocking the pre-frontal cortex, as the Focus device does, is thought to improve learning and working memory, while shocking the motor cortex may raise one's threshold for pain and improve the use of one's non-dominant hand.\n\nIt may sound too good to be true, but a study published in Neuroscience Letters last year shows how 33 subjects attempted to solve a logic puzzle with and without tDCS. 40% succeeded using the stimulation, while none of them were able to without it.\n\n[b][color=white]$1 Million Saints Row IV Edition Includes Plastic Surgery [/color][/b]\n[spoiler=]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/aYredXF.jpg[/IMG]\n[/spoiler]\n\nThe plots of the Saints Row series of action-adventure video games have escalated from a grungy gangland beginning all the way -- with the upcoming Saints Row IV -- to landing characters in the White House for a battle with invading aliens. To match the absurdity of the story line, publisher Deep Silver is offering a unique special edition package of the game as a publicity stunt. The Saints Row IV Super Dangerous Wad Wad special edition comes with a $1 million price tag.  Along with the Commander-in-Chief edition of the actual game, you also get a ticket for a Virgin Galactic space flight, a full-size replica dub-step gun, a hostage rescue experience, a spy training day, a personal shopper, and vacations in Dubai and Washington, D.C. Also included, is a Lamborghini Gallardo, as well as a Toyota Prius if you're worried about gas guzzling. Only one Wad Wad edition is available, and it's up for sale on the UK [url=http://www.game.co.uk/en/saints-row-iv-super-dangerous-wad-wad-edition-180208?pageSize=20&searchTerm=Wad%20Wad%20Edition][b]Game Site[/b][/url].  It seems to be expected by the vague details that no one will actually be expected to buy it.\n\n[b][color=white]Court Officially Declares Bitcoin a Real Currency[/color][/b]\nA federal judge has for the first time ruled that Bitcoin is a legitimate currency, opening up the possibility for the digital crypto-cash to soon be regulated by governmental overseers.\n\nTrendon Shavers of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST) was  accused last year of scamming customers out of roughly $4.5 million worth of the cryptocurrency through his online hedge-fund. He promised investors a weekly return of 7%, but shut down his site after collecting upwards of 700,000 bitcoins. When the SEC charged Shavers last month with operating a Ponzi scheme, he fought back by saying Bitcoin is not actual currency and can’t be regulated.\n\n[spoiler=Quote:]\n[quote]“The SEC asserts that Shavers made a number of misrepresentations to investors regarding the nature of the investments and that he defrauded investors. However, the question currently before the Court is whether the BTCST investments in this case are securities as defined by Federal Securities Laws,” Judge Mazzant wrote this week. “Shavers argues that the BTCST investments are not securities because Bitcoin is not money, and is not part of anything regulated by the United States. Shavers also contends that his transactions were all Bitcoin transactions and that no money ever exchanged hands. The SEC argues that the BTCST investments are both investment contracts and notes, and, thus, are securities.”\n[/quote]\n[/spoiler]\n\nDespite Shavers' argument, Judge Mazzant weighed in this week with an opinion that's not only quite the opposite, but could have widespread repercussions in the world of Bitcoin. What does this mean for Hack Forums?\n\n[b][color=white]NSA Loophole Allows Warrantless Search for US Citizens' Emails and Phone Calls[/color][/b]\nThe National Security Agency has a secret backdoor into its vast databases under a legal authority enabling it to search for US citizens' email and phone calls without a warrant, according to a top-secret document from Edward Snowden. The previously undisclosed rule change allows NSA operatives to hunt for individual Americans' communications using their name or other identifying information. Senator Ron Wyden reported that the law provides the NSA with a loophole potentially allowing \"warrantless searches for the phone calls or emails of law-abiding Americans\".\n\nThe authority, approved in 2011, appears to contrast with repeated assurances from Barack Obama and senior intelligence officials to both Congress and the American public that the privacy of US citizens is protected from the NSA's dragnet surveillance programs.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Katy Perry Drops New Song[/b][/color]\nKaty Perry's new album, Prism, is going to be released to the public soon enough on August 12th. Sadly for her, one of her songs was leaked across the internet. Well, there is good news for that, too. Radios across the world are broadcasting her new song hourly, and everyone can get a new taste of her song. The song from her album is currently titled 'Roar'. This is currently her fourth album. Katy announced that the song itself will be dropped as a single on iTunes later at midnight tonight. As for the album, it will be released around October 22nd of this year. As always, it has Katy's sassy, sexy, and all of her styles you can imagine. The song has an easy beat to follow and dance along with, as well as lyrics that are going to amaze you. This single is supposedly going to help her out when it's time to release her actual album. She wants fans to love it, share it with friends, and just get the party started. Everyone knows Katy's weird and strange style, and she has been traveling across the country showing off her new song in a 18 wheeler truck! Amazing, right?!\n\n[color=white][b]Gucci Mane Sued For Leaving Show Early to Go Perform in Another State[/b][/color]\nGucci Mane only performed for 15 minutes at one of his shows! He wanted to wrap up that concert so he could go perform at another. The concert promoters which was Empire Entertainment is going to be filing a lawsuit against Gucci. They are doing their best to claim that the he did not perform everything as promised. Empire paid Gucci Mane a total of $22,500 to perform in Little Rock, Arkansas. Before the show, a  nightclub in Tennessee had already started to advertise that Gucci would show up on the same night of his current concert in Arkansas! Even Gucci shared with everyone on Twitter about the show in Tennessee. So to wrap everything up, basically Gucci was offered to perform two times in the same night. He performed in Arkansas for at least 15 minutes or less, left early, went to Tennessee to perform in a nightclub, and after that he went back to Arkansas and stayed in the hotel that Empire provided! Empire is suing for breach of contract and fraud. They want him to pay for the hotel, the shows, and everything he took.\n\n[color=white][b]Miley Cyrus Recruits Big Sean, Ludacris, and Other Artists[/b][/color]\nFor the past few weeks, everyone has noticed how sweet ole' Miley turned into twerk-loving pop diva. She's continuing with what she's doing and creating a fourth album. She is naming this album 'BANGERZ' and is going to be collaborating with a bunch of different rappers in this album. Not only is she picking up Big Sean and Ludacris along the way, but Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa will be showcased too. Fans aren't supposed to expect it to be a hip-hop album. It's going to be all about her influences and everything she has been doing. She has definitely shocked fans when it comes to her new look. Some questionable lyrics could be 'Is it \"Molly\" or \"Miley\"?'\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmSbXsFE3l8[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nBe wary of your own ambition.",

I'd say Complexity, \nbut in all honesty, I never see them contributing to HF, or at least in web \ndesign, graphics, and programming. Then there's the Alliance; sure it's a HQ \ngroup and contributes a lot, I wouldn't want to be in a group in which \nspecializes in quality. I'd rather be in a group that's fun, with intelligent \npeople. I'm going to have to choose the Empire. Tibit has done an incredible \njob running it, and hasn't had any huge problems with users on HF regarding \ncrap products, scam reports, or anything like that.
