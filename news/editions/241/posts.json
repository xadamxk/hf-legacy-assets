Welcome to the 241st Edition of the HF News. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to give a shout out to all my homies struggling in Compton. I'd also like to say hi to keyz, you're still blonde for thinking Amsterdam was a province in Norway.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Alright. Rather than ask the same old questions, let's dive right into some questions that directly relate to recent events. First up, we've seen recently that a leader of your new group, Crypto, scammed a member for over 9 BTC on HackForums. How do you think this will reflect upon the reputation of the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I hope the members of HF have an absolutely desolate reflection of the incident on Crypto, because I was in no way, shape, or form aware that the funds he was using were fraudulent. When adequate proof was presented (along with his admission) I removed him from leadership immediately, as he directly broke our contract by representing the group in a hostile way. One of the main goals of Crypto is to represent the exchange section as a safe place to exchange, so evidently I cannot have a leader who has been accused of stealing BTC from a fellow HF member.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Good to hear. So, tell us more about Crypto; what are your future plans for the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Currently I'm just trying to establish a motivated and active member base, so that we can begin to finally make a name for the group. We have a few projects in mind which I won't expose just yet, but one of them includes a few different coin faucets. We also plan on doing anything we can to further grow and support Omnicoin.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's nice! Speaking about virtual currency, when did you first become interested in it, and what caused you to dedicate an entire group to it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I first became interested in Bitcoin specifically when I started to become more active on HF. I immediately realized that it was a waaaaay better alternative to PayPal, and from then on I started to get active in the currency exchange section, mostly exchanging with my fellow Canadians. I was initially planning on making my group dedicated to film and music, but a few people convinced me that a crypto currency group was the way to go. I can't really say if it was a good choice or not yet, since we just started. However, I can already tell that it will be a lot more fun in the long run.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. How will Crypto distinguish itself from the numerous groups already present on HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] It will definitely be a challenge. Every new group owner has their mind set on making their group successful and \"different\" but few actually achieve it. I think through my activity and dedication (as well as having a great niche like crypto currency) I will be able to make a great name for the group. We're not looking to produce the cliché help desks and tutorials that most groups do, but rather diverse and well-thoughtout projects. One thing I'm planning on doing soon is donating $500 BTC in Crypto's name to \"the water project.\" $500 will allow for 2 families to have access to clean water in Africa.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's very generous of you. Most groups these days sell buy-ins, so that the owners and leaders of these groups can receive a return of their monetary investment into a group. Will there be buy-ins for Crypto?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] No absolutely not. I was originally planning to sell a limited amount of 5 buy-ins for $100 BTC each, which was all going to go towards that $500 donation, but I might just pay for it out of my own pocket, considering I've never donated to charity before.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Good to hear that you changed your mind on that. Does Crypto plan on getting involved with the official Omnicoin project (alongside Omniscient and Abraham Lincoln) in the future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Other than the members we have in our group who are already on the OMC team, most likely not. However, we do plan on support Omnicoin in a few innovative ways, which I won't release just yet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds good. With the recent removal of Crypto's last leader, what are your plans for selecting a new replacement?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I actually have no idea. I may sell another one or I may just elect someone I feel is worthy. It's hard to say right now, but I will probably run it myself for a month or two.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Alright. As for normal members of HackForums who are interested in joining Crypto in the future, what advice/tips can you give in order to help these members in future recruitment's for the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Have a foundation of proof that shows me you're passionate about crypto currency and/or exchanging. I don't hold the cliché applications in which people lie on, but rather a simple yes/no questionnaire that allows me to then inspect the applicants profile in-depth, to see if I want them in my group. Right now I'm mainly looking for people with a notable amount of activity in the exchanging section, as we are now conducting exchanges within the SF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=green][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Cool. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have here today. Do you have any final comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed. We also have a currently open recruitment for anyone who is interested in joining Crypto.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

Unfortunately, it was recently the target of a string of malicious attacks, one of which may have been successful. A Tai hacker claims to have breached the website's security and stolen the database from AFF and has been selling it on numerous underground websites for approximately $17,000 in BTC. The hacker, who is currently under the pseudonym \"ROR[RG]\", is also offering his services to breach companies' websites for roughly $170,000 in BTC. As for AFF, there is a kernel of good news in that no finiancial information has yet been known to have been stolen. This means that, though the attackers have names, addresses, and emails, they won't be able to cause financial destruction. Also, though it was not indicated that password information was received, AFF is taking precautionary measures by having everyone update their passwords to ensure they do not get their accounts hijacked. Since this may be considered to be a cyber-terrorist attack, the FBI has been notified and are currently investigating further with FireEye.\n\n[color=white][b]Founder of Silk Road Appeals to Emotions[/b][/color]\nAs certainly most of you have already been aware, Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the hugely popular underground, illegal drug marketplace Silk Road, has been convicted of his rimes and faces 20 or more years in federal prison. Ulbricht and 97 friends and family members wrote the Judge personal letters asking to reduce his sentence. Both their [url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2086667-gov-uscourts-nysd-422824-251-2.html]letters[/url] and [url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2086660-gov-uscourts-nysd-422824-251-8.html]photographs[/url] have since been posted online in an attempt to coerce the judge to give Ulbricht a 20 year sentence as opposed to life in prison. In one of Ulbricht's letters, he writes:[i][list]\"I’ve had my youth, and I know you must take away my middle years, but please leave me my old age. Please leave a small light at the end of the tunnel, an excuse to stay healthy, an excuse to dream of better days ahead, and a chance to redeem myself in the free world\"[/list][/i]Though we don't yet know the ultimate fate of Ulbricht, some crimes that he has done may not be able to be overlooked so easily.\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://ihydra.net/hfnt/headers/SecurityNews241.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Android Factory Reset Leaves Private Data[/color][/b]\nThe amount of Android devices that are resold make an effective device wiping mechanism incredibly important. The OS's native wiping function may not be doing the job that it advertises. A paper published by Ross Anderson and Laurent Simon of the University of Cambridge in the U.K. investigate the Android factory reset function. They discovered that the function may have left half a billion Android devices that have been wiped using this method vulnerable to data loss, including logins, personal emails, and personal chats. The two researchers studied 21 Android devices from 4 different vendors running Froyo (2.3) to Gingerbread (4.3). The researchers discovered that even if the disk is encrypted by the user, the flawed reset leaves the encryption key for device susceptible. When the OS deletes a file, it just deletes the file's name from the table of files instead of deleting the data itself or instead of writing over the data. Data is sometimes copied to a different block in the flash memory which leaves a copy of the data that is not deleted. Using Gingerbread (4.3), the researchers said on average, 90% of the data on a device was not properly deleted.

BCBS is one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, providing healthcare for nearly one-third of the United States' Population. CareFirst CEO Chet Burrell has assured provides that social security numbers, medical claims, employment, payment cards, and financial information were not stolen in the attack. However, user names, names, birth dates, email addresses, and subscriber identification numbers were breached. The passwords for these accounts remained protected and encrypted on a separate server. Trent Telford, the CEO of data security firm Covata, says that that if a company holds private information about clients, employees, and others, it is their responsibility to encrypt said data to help prevent malicious attacks such as the one that has occurred.

The vulnerability was originally reported to Sendio by researchers at Core Security Technologies on March 24th. The researchers are also included proof of concept code that triggers the issue. Sendio version 6 was susceptible to the bug, but it was patched in Sendio version 7.2.4. “Two information disclosure issues were found affecting some versions of this software, and can lead to leakage of sensitive information such as user’s session identifiers and/or user’s email messages,” Core Security said. The first vulnerability discloses a session cookie. This issue occurred because ESP's web platform contains the cookie identifier in the URL. This disclosure allows hackers to hijack a user's session, read their emails, and send emails on the users behalf. The servers also had an issue with improperly handling user sessions that lead to sensitive information being disclosed to the wrong user.

On May 20, publisher NCsoft announced that [i]Blade & Soul[/i] will be coming to both North America and Europe this winter. The game has made a name for itself from its focus on martial arts and inspiration from Chinese kung fu stories. The game takes place across four different in-game continents, two of which are locked at the start. Reaching the level 50 cap on the game doesn’t require the player to play any of the extra content past the main storyline, but plenty of side content will still be present, alongside player-versus-player gameplay and multi-player dungeons. NCSoft community director Omeed Dariani has said that they are working to adjust the game to make it less grindy for western players, with comments about how it only takes two or three weeks of regular play to hit level 50. A large amount of additional content has been added to the game’s Korean iteration, with most of that content expected to eventually be made available for western audiences. The game will be free-to-play with no main game content hinging on the purchase of extra content. [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/20/8628793/blade-and-soul-martial-arts-mmo-first-look-preview-video-north-america-ncsoft]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white][i]Don’t Starve: Giant Edition[/i] Coming to Wii U\n[/color][/b]It was announced by Klei Entertainment on May 21 that the game [i]Don’t Starve: Giant Edition[/i] will be available to purchase for the Wii U through the Nintendo eShop on May 28. The game was first released in 2013 and pits players to survive as long as possible in the wilderness. The [i]Giant Edition[/i] has the original game plus its [i]Reign of Giants[/i] expansion pack. While the game is being released May 28 on the Wii U, purchases of the game before June 28 will include a bonus gift copy that can be given to others. The Wii U edition of [i]Don’t Starve: Giant Edition[/i] will be available in Europe on June 4. A review of the game by the gaming article publisher Polygon can be found [url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/21/8639409/dont-starve-giant-edition-wii-u-release-date#ooid=Q2cDZ5ajrDYqUSFRGMw0dpucLtS9-lmR]here[/url].

This follows the lack of a core [i]Need for Speed[/i] title being released in 2014, the first year in a decade that a core [i]Need for Speed[/i] title was not released. In an interview with Gamespot, Ghost Games general manager Marcus Nilsson had this to say about the game’s story: \"We are taking a very innovative approach to how we tell a story. That's actually probably as much as I can say at this time,\" says Nilsson. \"If you just go back three years with Need for Speed: The Run, there were stories in Need for Speed. Absolutely not the best executed stories. But we had stories. And I think a missing piece from the last games we had has been narrative. I think we can deliver a better game to our fans if we connect to them emotionally through story.\" The game is also expected to have more online features than past games in the series.

The search giant Google has already confirmed that it’s going to unveil Android M (Android 6.0) at its 2015 I/O developer conference next week in San Francisco, and a few reports now claim to have knowledge of one of the major features that are going to be available to Android M users in the near future. According to Ars Technica, Google will introduce native fingerprint authentication for its Android M operating system. This new feature would allow users to log into “supported applications” using a fingerprint instead of a password. Presumably users would also be able to use the same method to unlock a device. [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.ibtimes.com/google-io-conference-android-m-android-60-include-native-fingerprint-authentication-1934525]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]Google Patents 'Creepy' Internet Toys[/color][/b]\nThe minds behind the world’s most powerful search engine may have come up with a hi-tech cuddly toy. According to a US patent filed by Google’s self-proclaimed mad scientist Richard DeVaul and fellow engineer Daniel Aminzade, the company has designed “an anthropomorphic device, perhaps in the form factor of a doll or toy\". The patent outlines a teddy bear-shaped device which will sit in users’ homes, interact with them and get to know their tastes. The doll will switch on the TV when asked, tell the weather forecast and get to know people’s preferences. In theory, Google’s teddy bear could control computers, lights, fridges and CD player through verbal commands – potentially doing away with remote controls.

If the words \"Uber Advanced Technologies Center\" imprinted on the side of the vehicle weren't enough of a giveaway, the giant spinning cameras and sensors attached to the top of the vehicle signals this isn't your average car. The modified Ford branded with “Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center”, was spotted on residential streets by the Pittsburgh Business Times. Uber announced in February that it would open a research centre in Pittsburgh to develop self-driving technology to replace drivers in its taxis.

The Senate voted 57 - 42 against the USA Freedom Act which was an act to reform and fight against the current spying but due to its failure and Senator Mitch McConnell's failed attempt to extend the Patriot Act to justify the spying; temporarily, that means the government’s bulk collection of phone records from U.S. telecoms is on hold. The NSA Program was first uncovered by USA Today in 2006 but was recently revealed again by whistleblower Edward Snowden. NSA were allowed to spy on the citizens of America (and possibly more) by using claims of terrorism and harm to nation security as reasoning and therefore collected records of calls in bulk. The program is now in limbo while the Senate and government officials work to pass a bill which either allows or disallows such things.

Carter has said to CNN that the Iraqi forces \"vastly outnumbered\" the IS rebels but instead chose to retreat from the city in what can only be described as a rout. The head of Iraq's defense and security committee said the comments were \"unrealistic and baseless\". Iraqi government has now deployed Shia militias to the area to try to halt the advance of IS. On Saturday the Shia militia retook Husayba, east of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, with heavy fighting continuing within the area.

More than 62% has voted to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry and it is the first country to allow same-sex marriage through a large country vote. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 20 countries worldwide. The vote allows for several things to now happen: The Republic of Ireland has a written constitution which can only be changed by referendum and Same sex married couples will now have the same rights as a married man and women.  In total, 1,201,607 people voted in favour of same-sex marriage, while 734,300 voted against.
