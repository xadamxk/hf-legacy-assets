One of those two new features is a statistics page for the total amount of HFIM accounts, logins for the past hour, and the accounts that were active in the last 24 hours. You can find the statistics option on the table header to the right or, [url=http://hackforums.net/hfim.php?action=stats]here[/url]. This new feature will surely help [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] and other members of the forum to watch the HFIM grow, and of course it's always nice knowing the statistics. You can find [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] thread announcing the new feature, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4564952]here[/url]. Next on the list of newly implemented features is the HFIM on profiles. You can now view the status of another members HFIM to see whether they're online (green), away (yellow), or do not disturb (red). You can message the member directly by simply clicking on the linked 'HF IM XMPP' option, however in order for it to be clickable you need to have a client installed that added the URI to the browser. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also added an 'Add' option so you may add any user that has an HF IM XMPP account. You can find [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] thread explaining the new feature, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4563925]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Bruteforcing Turns to the Closing of Inactive Accounts[/b][/color]\nOn December 2nd, 2014 someone tried using the 2010 dump to bruteforce logins. Back in 2010, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] was forced to close inactive accounts and force password changes on all upgraded accounts. Just a few days ago though someone tried using that dump to login to about 1,000 accounts or more. Whomever it was wasn't able to get very far however as [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] required all L33t/Ub3r members to change their passwords and the person who tried getting into those accounts only had the credentials for non-upgraded and closed accounts. All this person did was unhash the account credentials and bot the login page, which led to that person getting into less than 100 accounts, two of which were inactive L33t's which are now closed, and not one Ub3r account was compromised. The rest of the accounts that [i]were[/i] compromised have been closed. You can read [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] thread explaining all of it, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4565551]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]New Feature for the Ignore List[/b][/color]\nOn December 3rd, 2014 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] implemented a new feature that involves the ignore list and user profiles. If a user has you on their ignore list you will now not be able to view that users profile, and of course vice-versa. I'm sure we can all thank [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] for this new feature as it would help all of us who do have users on our ignore lists.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I'd love to give a shout-out to a few members i've met on my HF journey, starting with Erwin Schrödinger. When i first made my HF account, i had a few problems, and he hit me up. Then helped me fixing all problems, regarding my LoL Client. I now talk to him, every single day. I can also say my journey has given me alot of insight on how things work, and on how people react.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I was basicly doing some graphics for a Youtuber, and would find it nice to give away a few things. I searched for a forum, so i could reach more people. i then found Hack Forums, by browsing Google. I became addicted pretty quickly, and i was a total skid, at first.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I can see you're quite active in that section. So tell me about yourself, where are you from? Are you currently going to school for anything?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I'm Nick, 14 years old, and born in Holland. I go to the secondary school, and i'm in the 3rd grade. I'm doing the highest ''level'' possible. This usually takes alot of time; Atleast 2-3 hours homework per day, which isn't pretty... On the other hand, it really motivates me to be active on HF. Whenever i've done my homework, i can always go on HF, post abit, read some interesting topics, and just chill out!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Three hours? Holy crap. So I was doing a little research and saw that you gamed. So what games do you play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I play a wide variety of games! But only on fridays and saturdays, since i don't want my school to get into problems. I got a very decent PC, and a PS3. I play Far Cry, Payday, LoL, Counterstrike & Grid on my computer, and Cod on my Playstation. Back in the day, in BO2, i played alot of league play, which is just like ranked on LoL, and ended up making a team with some people i met online. We decided to enter a tournament, with Dutch teams only. There were 64 entering, and since we didn't play alot together, we would have been satisfied ending around the 35th place. Our first match went really well, just like our second, and third. We then had to play against Fariko YangNL, which is the official team of Fariko under 15, on PS3. We won the first game, but lost the second and third one. We ended 8th, after winning a simple game against a bad team. Not sure if anyone here knows, but anyone remembers the name ''Axora'' ? Haha, well, we had alot of fun. We started a Youtube channel, and got a few shoutouts from some big commentators. After a week or two, i decided to quit, because people were getting mad at each other, etc. I then started Trickshotting, Video Editing, and Graphics Designing, which i still do.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Wow so you put all the stuff on YouTube and enter contests, that's pretty cool. SO do you plan on playing competitively in the future? I know you were against 15 and under, but would you eventually like to compete someday?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] Possibly, when i'm finished with school, i'll start streaming. It looks like it's a very fun thing to do. Another thing which would be in my favor, is how i'm able to set up everything myself. Since i can do the graphics, recording on my own! Possibly not Cod though, since i really don't like where they went with Advanced Warfare. I think the whole tactic behind playing is gone, which leaves me quite sad. Hopefully a different game will rise, within a few years!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree with you on the Advanced Warefare opinion, after CoD4 all gaming went downhill, that's why I've been sticking with CSGO. Are there any games coming out in the near future that you're looking forward to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] Possibly Evolve! in my opinion, it has alot of potential. It's basicly a game where one of the players is a monster, and there are 4 hunters. The hunters have to kill the monster, and the monster the hunters. The best thing about it is how you are able to ''Evolve'' in game, gaining new points for your abilities. A monster at stage 1 is not able to kill the hunters, but when stage 4, he's able to easily take out all the hunters with one ability. If they are able to bring enough monsters, perks, abilities, and guns, i can see a bright future for Evolve.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. I heard about GTA5 for Steam and that's what really has me eager. So I always like to get a l33ts perspective, how are you enjoying Hack Forums? How would you rate you experience from 1-10?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] GTA 5 on PC will be really great, with all the possible mods and stuff! Also, i really, really like HF. It has a few downsides though. The staff and admins are really nice, they are always listening to your story, and are always there when you need them. A thing i do not like, is how Ub3rs, sometimes think they are better than other members, just because they bought an upgrade on a forum, and are able to neg rep people. I'm only talking about 10%-5% of the people, though, it's very annoying. You can clearly see, when you're a regular member, you get alot negative reputation, for simply stating your opinion. It really bothers me. Another thing which is just bad, is the Ebook section. There are just way to many people using smart marketing tactics and misleading titles to get customers, who are most of the time, new members. They are fooled by some of the threads, with Vouches, ''Proof'', and more. Also, the SSM is a total joke. There are still way too many people selling accounts, even though there's a whole dedicated subforum for it. The reason they are selling them there, is because the subforum is restricted to Ub3r created threads. Nonetheless, i'm very happy with HF. It's great hearing a story from someone, or discussing something which has happened on another continent.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] You pointed out some things that I agree with. Do you feel looked down on as a l33t member or do you feel like an equal to an ub3r member?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I feel totally equal to every single member on this forum, a $20 upgrade doesn't make you any better. Something else i don't really get, is how there are so many ub3r members? Wasn't it something, like a... ''special'' rank? I guess it was! I applied, and got denied. Everytime, i see someone with alot less posts, and alot less rep, it hurts a little inside. There are some people, who find it very funny to act tough. You don't want to know how many people actually laughed in my face when i said i got denied. They are all banned though. I just feel like the people who actually hate on others, are not strong enough to keep themselfs up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Knowing what you know would do you see an ub3r upgrade in your future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] That all depends on Omni's mood, and if he wants to approve me. I do think i got a good chance of getting approved, since i've contributed quite alot, in the past. Not only giveaways, tutorials or helpdesks, but also on off-site helping people. I got alot of cools things in my mind, which i can hopefully bring to the table. I'm also planning on becoming more active on HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What goes around comes around, I wish you the best of luck. So if you could change one thing on site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I'd most likely make you leader of a brand new group, called ''The Appraisers''  Blush In all seriousness, i would most likely have a a new staff member regularly check the deal disputes, and the community alerts. That way, HF will most likely be a safer environment, with less scammers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I wish HF was safer myself, but that's a thing that just seems so difficult to do. So how do you feel about the recent OmniCoin hype? Do you use the Hack Forum's official crypto currency?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I feel like OmniCoin has actually failed. Not alot of people are using it, neither are there alot of things you can do with it. The price has gone downhill alot, lately. Omni has to either add in a few new things we're able to do with OMC, like gambling, or it will die out very soon.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] There was so much hype in the beginning and it's near impossible to find it due to hoarding members. Makes upgrading / getting the award near impossible. Well that's all the time we have for today do you have any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914][color=white][b]Present:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to thank you for this amazing opportunity! I really liked doing this interview, just as much as reading the HF news, every week again! I got alot of respect, for how you guys are always able to put together such a great thread! Keep it up!

In this edition's interview, we are with -Hyperion. Before we begin, are there any shoutouts you would like to have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] I would like to give a shoutout to my boi Aura and the BHCPU/BHPEN team.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Nice. It's always nice to see The Brotherhood represented. What brought you to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] Originally I wanted to get a keylogger to put on my laptop so I could get a past the parental controls back in 2007. Then as I got more and more into computer the pen testing and WHH area became a great resource to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting! Speaking about the White Hat Help area, I see you recently made some pretty in-depth threads about Malware Analysis and Removal. Where did you become so experienced in these areas?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] Back in 2011 I started a small computer business doing virus removal and tune ups because I had been fixing my own computer for awhile and was pissed at the high prices Staples where charging. I pretty quickly got into more in-depth jobs and in 2012 I started doing pen tests as well, since then I have continued to run my business on the side and now do industrial support for a fortune 500 company. So I have 4 years of personal exp 3 years of career tech (IT, micro computing and industrial maintenance) and 6 months of corporate technical support.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Your experience is quite remarkable. What other interests do you have outside of Computers and Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] My other interests include cooking and electrical projects. I combined the two when I made a PID controlled sous-vide cooker out of an Arduino.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] That sound's awesome. How did the project come out? Did you run into any issues with the project?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] I ran into code issues with the library the thermistor I had bought came with. Once a different one was bought and the code changed to work on my version of Arduino the project now will hold a set temperature for hours. I would highly recommend someone to get an Arduino if they like electronics or programming as it so versatile and teaches a lot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] That's sparked my interest to check something out like that, sounds like it was a very useful outcome of that project. Now let's talk about the new features for Hack Forums. What new feature are you looking forward to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] I am looking forward to a better chat system, overhalled pm service and perhaps a malware analysis service for the community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I agree. In what ways do you think the community as a whole can work towards learning about malware analysis and removal, or even towards white hat help as a whole?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] I think they can learn though several well done tutorials on HF right now, and by watching other people help clean up infections. They should not be afraid to try (on a properly setup VM) to analyze a piece or remove it. The best thing one could do right now is to teach yourself basic protection( how do I keep myself clean, how do I keep running fully optimized and how to remove basic malware) this would free up more time and help for more advanced problems. I believe every user should have a general knowledge of a computer and how it works. Do not be afraid to send someone a PM and remember to always ask, if you don't ask you won't learn.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#00ecff][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] I could not agree more. Keep up the great work with your tutorials and helping other members in the White Hat Help section as well as other areas on the site. Is there anything else you would like to say before we end the interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I would like to add that one of the best features on HF right now is the search so do not forget to use it ;) also stay tuned for an in depth tutorial on analyzing malware and an upcoming Q&A. The BHPEN is fixing to launch and we hope to be of great service to the comminuties. Also never let anyony discourge you because of your age the younger you get involved and start teaching yourself the better off you will be :)\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

This seemed to be rather successful for a while, but as malicious robots progressed and text-reading computer programs became more advanced, they been able to discern over 98% of the CAPTCHA photographs rendering it almost completely useless. For this reason, Google set to work creating an all new [url=https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/]reCAPTCHAv2[/url] which is both more user friendly in the sense that it no longer requires you to decode hieroglyphics, and more bot unfriendly with a much more secure method of detecting bots. This new risk analysis engine has an immensely high success rate and an almost zero false positive rate.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Dangerous PayPal CSRF Vulnerability[/color][/b]\r\nThe well-known and widely used online payment website PayPal has, yet again, been the target of an attack. A hacker by the name of Yasser discovered a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that may allow you to take over someone's account. Once the attacker has discovered the victim's access code, which is transmitted across interceptable network traffic, the attacker can then use the exploit to run a malicious web server that, once visited by the victim, will exploit the CSRF vulnerability and reset the victim's security questions as well as make the attacker's email address considered the Primary one. Though a number of assumptions are made, and the stars must be aligned, it is still a real and present danger. Unsuspecting computer users, especially in public areas or open networks, are vulnerable. The same hacker, last month, used a similar method to take over eBay accounts in under 60 seconds.\r\n\n[color=white][b]North Korea Denies Role in Sony Hack[/b][/color]\r\nContrary to what most believe, it has now been reported that a North Korean official (who has not been identified) has denied the allegations surrounding his country and the recent Sony Pictures breach. The man stated that none of their hackers or sponsors should be held accountable for the attack on Sony Pictures. The main reason North Korea was being named as the ones responsible behind the attacks was because many believed their motif was fueled by the release of the upcoming movie “The Interview” which includes a comedy based story where reporters are sent to assassinate the Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. However, an abundance of security experts and government officials have ruled out these speculations. Sony is now vigorously fighting file sharing sites to have their stolen and leaked files removed. \r\n\n[color=white][b]E-Cigarettes Can Give You Malware?[/b][/color]\r\nIt is now being stipulated that while the widely used electronic cigarettes could be good for your lungs, they are in fact extremely bad for your computer. Once the electronic cigarettes are plugged into your computer through their connectors, it could possibly infect your computer with Malware. Now, this isn't to say that the reputable and name brand electronic cigarettes are going to infect your computer once plugged in via USB, or their special cable – this is simply a warning that they may be infected with Malware when you buy them from unreliable or unrepeatable suppliers (mostly the ones that come from Chinese suppliers). So, if you are currently a user of E-cigarettes it is recommended that you buy them from reliable suppliers only, or your computer may suffer in the end.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Five Movies leaked from Sony Pictures[/b][/color]\r\nContinuing with the recent breach in the Sony Pictures systems, it has been confirmed that five or more exclusive movies (that were, or are not yet available to the public) have been leaked online by the hackers. These movies include but are not limited to: Fury, Annie, Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms. It is said that just fury has already been downloaded a whopping 1.2 million times from over 800,000 unique IP addresses. As recently stated, Sony Pictures is vigorously fighting to get these leaks taken down from various file sharing sites, which of course is extremely strenuous, if not impossible.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=188108]Djlatino[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n[b][color=white]The NSA, and the AURORAGOLDen Gates [/color][/b]\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the National Security Agency has been targeting and monitoring people, companies, and governments for ages, but their methods of spying are what intrigue us. One particular method of theirs, labeled “AURORAGOLD” is said to be able to monitor messages going in and out of cell phone tech giants. One particular target being the GSM Association, which is responsible for ensuring that numerous devices and networks are compatible with cellular technology. One source states that the NSA targets “IR.21” documents shared amongst these GSMA members, these documents including details on encryption and technical standards. By giving the NSA access to these documents that describe how the phones themselves operate, we grant the NSA complete control over our cellular phones, and networks.\r\n\n[b][color=white]”Wiper” Malware Wipes Out Sony[/color][/b]\r\nWith more and more news regarding Sony Pictures recent intrusion, not many have talked about the malware that destroyed Sony from the inside, after the initial attack. The main drive for the malware is to wreak havoc, to destroy the infected computers and their networks through a number of clandestine ways. The FBI describes the “Wiper” malware as very sophisticated, and it has been seen to have ties with IP addresses from Cyprus, to Poland, to Japan. Through a myriad of chaotic steps, the “Wiper” malware installs itself to target computer, spreads itself, and formats the hard drives of those infected by the malware, all the while trying to connect to a Command and Control center. Antivirus vendor “Sophos” has added a detection for the wiper malware to its definitions database labeled “Troj/Destover-C”, and I’d assume numerous others will follow suit.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Trojan Trojan?[/color][/b]\r\nIt seems that attackers are now targeting browsers more than ever, and with good reason, they’re easy to attack! We’ve all seen fake offers to “clean your computer” or that claim that “your computer is not safe!”, but we’ve all seen them either in an ad, or on another program, never directly in your browser. Tied with an unmentionable, but very common “banking trojan”, attackers have been seen utilizing the error messages we all receive from our browsers for normal things screwing up to lure users into downloading said trojan. Errors like “this is an untrusted connection” or simply a notification that one of your plug-ins aren’t working are being genetically engineered to fool everyday people into downloading malware. Using exploits in common services such as Adobe Flash and Java, these attackers prey on those who try to protect themselves against malware, but instead download malware disguised on protecting.\r\n\n[b][color=white]No Captcha ReCaptcha - Easy For Humans, Hard For Bots[/color][/b]\r\nGoogle has publically announced their new revision of reCaptcha, calling it \"No Captcha ReCaptcha\", along with a new API that is designed to provide various options, far easier than the commonly known method of typing distorted text. Simple and accurate is what the team behind it aims for, as the new method includes simple ways of verifying your humanity such as checking off a radio box and matching images according to their niche. That being said, No Captcha ReCaptcha heavily relies on Javascript, making hard for everyday mobile devices, but since this is at such an early stage, there is no doubt that Google will be improving the mechanism behind it night and day. The API remains scarce, and the old one seems to have disappeared, for the better as many suggest. With services such as DeathByCaptcha, the net was in need of a facelift for one of the most used anti-spam prevention systems out there.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Facebook now partners with ESET, a widely known security software vendor[/color][/b]\r\nWith mobile devices beginning to match up to PC specs, they become the next target for hackers everywhere. From banking to map directions, it holds vital information that can be used in malicious ways. Prevention is key, and social media monster Facebook is taking the hint. Their new found partnership with ESET provides an unique way for users to feel safe, with anyone having the application installed on their mobile device now comes with complementry malware scanning, provided by ESET. Any background services that seem to have malicious code triggers a message that requests that your device be scanned by ESET's malware database. Facebook currently has over 1.3 billion users from around the world, being one of the major social outlets existing on the net as of 2014.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Sony just can't get a break - New hack leaks 47,000 SSNs[/color][/b]\r\nFor the past few weeks, Sony seems to be that one kid in middle school that kept getting pushed in the snow because he was different. Sony Entertainment, having 4 major hollywood films leaked, is now saying that 47,000 Social Security Numbers were leaked as well, mostly pertaining to Hollywood Celebrities. Said to have been stored in an insecure Excel document, the leak also included copies of their passports and other personal information, questioning whether this company takes their security seriously. Some are speculating that this might be the acts of North Korean hackers, as the highly anticipated movie \"The Interview\", mocking Kim Jong-Un, is said to be released by Sony Entertainment themselves. Dating back to 2011, Sony is no stranger to being attacked. Their infamous online gaming platform \"PlayStation Network\" was torn to bits in April 17, 2011, it was reported to have caused millions of users data at risk, made everyone believe that this would be a wake up call for the security team, current events beg to differ.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align] [align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url][/b][/align] [align=center][spoiler=]\r\n\n[align=left][b][color=white]CoD: AW Receives Big Update[/color][/b] \r\nAlthough the recent Call of Duty has been out for quite some time, it has had a few updates here and there along the path that it's currently taking. With all the past updates, Sledgehammer Games says this will be the biggest update ever that the game will see. With new nerfed and buffed weapons, hopefully gun fights will be more of a skill-fight now rather than having an over-powerful weapon stronger than someone who is using a gun that's less-powerful, and possibly might not have the stronger gun unlocked yet. In addition to the gun tweaks, Sledgehammer games fixed some bugs, exploits, and other things that can be a hassle to deal with when playing against a cheater or buggy game. The current patch note for this update can be seen [url=https://community.callofduty.com/thread/200912705]here[/url]. The release date has not been announced yet, but a hint has been given that it may be out sometime this week. If not, next week.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Master Chief Collection Problems[/color][/b] \r\nHalo: Master Chief Collection has been irritating to some. The reason some people aren't interested in playing anymore or dislike Halo: MCC is due to the matchmaking problems. Various patches have been forced upon players, hopefully fixing the problem. Still, even through all the updates, a problem persists. Recently, 343 has worked on a patch for Xbox One that will hopefully get you into the gamemodes you'd like faster, but there's one problem. That problem will be that times may or may not be even. You might be playing 2v5, 4v4, and so on. It's ridiculous on how many problems this game has shown for how popular it is. This doesn't mean you should give up on it, no. It has been said by 343 that they will be releasing an update shortly after this one, to  ensure the lobbies are full and not uneven, causing unfair games to those playing. Courtesy of 343, they have shared the patch notes for the 12.3.14 update, which can be seen by clicking [url=https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/blog-posts/12-3-14-halo-the-master-chief-collection-content-update-notes]this[/url] link.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel DLC Revealed[/color][/b] \r\nBorderlands fans rejoice; a new DLC will be available for purchase on December 16 for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC. The Holodome Onslaught will be the second downloadable content available for the new Borderlands game. If you've picked up the Pre-Sequel pass, you will get the option to download the DLC as soon as possible. If you do not own a pass, you can purchase a DLC pass for $30. Of course, not everyone is interested in that, and The Holodome Onslaught will be available for $10 (without the pass). With new missions, and other cool features, you will also get a chance to see other Vault hunters from previous games, including Gaige and Axton. In addition, players should be expecting an update for the game soon. Patch notes have not been released yet, but will be available for the public to see soon.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Video Game Release Dates for the Week of December 5th, 2014:[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Dungeon Defenders II - PC - December 5th, 2014\r\n[*]Threes - Xbox One - December 5th, 2014\r\n[*]Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker - Wii U - December 5th, 2014\r\n[*]NES Remix Pack - Wii U - December 5th, 2014\r\n[*]Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris - PC, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 - December 9th, 2014\r\n[*]The Talos Principle - PC - December 9th, 2014\r\n[*]Fly Hunter Origins - Playstation Vita - December 9th, 2014\r\n[*]Game of Thrones Episode 1: Iron From Ice - Playstation 3 - December 9th, 2014\r\n[*]JUJU - PS3 - December 9th, 2014\r\n[*]Cargo 3 - PC - December 10th, 2014\r\n[*]Flyhunter Origins - PC - December 10th, 2014\r\n[*]Chaos Reborn - PC - December 11th, 2014\r\n[/align]\r\n[/list]\r\n\n[align=left][b][color=white]DLC Release Dates for the Week of December 5th, 2014:[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Destiny 'The Dark Below' DLC - PS3, PS4 - December 9th, 2014\r\n[*]X Rebirth: The Teladi Post DLC - Steam - [b]Free all through December[/b]\r\n[*]Pinball FX2 - Venom Tale - PC - December 10th, 2014\r\n[/align]\r\n[/list]\r\n\n[sp=Gaming Video of the Week]\r\n[yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAd-1QgkVTk[/yt]\r\n[/align]\r\n[/sp][/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/i1QkwoE.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\r\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n[b][color=white]Samsung Rumored To Be Completely Reinventing The Galaxy S Series, S6 Specs Leaked[/color][/b]\r\n\nSamsung recently stated it would be reinventing the wheel behind its Galaxy S series due to the S4 and S5 Android Smartphones lacking in consumer interest. A screenshot was leaked of the Galaxy S6 that would confirm this to be true, of course only if the leak was genuine. The leaked specs:\r\n\n[size=xx-small][list]\r\n[*]Model number: SM-G925F\r\n[*]Screen Size:  5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 (QHD) resolution\r\n[*]CPU: 64-bit octa-core Exynos processor\r\n[*]GPU: ARM Mali-T760 GPU,\r\n[*]Ram: 3GB\r\n[*]Storage: 32GB\r\n[*]Camera: 20-megapixel rear, 5-megapixel front\r\n[*]Operating System: Android 5.0 Lollipop\r\n[/list][/size]\r\n\n[img=200x400]http://cdn.bgr.com/2014/12/galaxy-s6-antutu-benchmark-specs-1.jpg?w=624[/img]\r\nImage Source: [url=CNMO.COM]CNMO.COM[/url]\r\n\nOf course this is all to speculation of a rumor and many things can change once Samsung makes the official announcement. One thing is for sure, Samsung is not happy with the consumer interest of the Galaxy S5 and they will strive to catch more interest with its upcoming models if they wish to stay on top of the Android smartphone market.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Google changes Captcha Simply By Asking, Are you a robot? [/color][/b]\r\nGoogle has changed its botting protection software Captcha from having to enter sometimes hard to read random texts, to simply stating that you aren't a robot by clicking a check mark that states \"I am not a robot\" and answering a Google security question from your own security questions. \r\n\nTo visually put it, this is what Captcha was:\r\n[img=200x100]http://i.imgur.com/95Yx9mW.png[/img]\r\nSource: [url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html]Google[/url]\r\n\nThis is what they changed it to:\r\n[img=200x100]http://i.imgur.com/m0AOKJ0.gif[/img]\r\nSource: [url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html]Google[/url]\r\n\nThis is a great improvement over the earlier CAPTCHA system due to the simplicity and elegance this new API has. Now it will ask you simple personal account related questions, ask you which picture is of a certain animal or what color the text question is in plus a check mark stating you are not a robot. This is a much-needed change for those who always get stuck because they are not sure of what something actually is supposed to be due to the scrambling of the text. \r\n\n[b][color=white]Verizon Expands 4G And 4G XTE, Begins Killing Off 3G[/color][/b]\r\nVerizon has begun using 20 MHz of 3G frequencies for 4G instead of its predecessor 3G. With most of Verizon's mobile platform running on the 4G LTE spectrum, they have decided it would be in consumers best interests to strengthen 4G over 3G, and inevitably end 3G in the coming years. They will still support 3G for many years to come regardless due to the many devices that require it, but the day will come when 4G+ is the only internet needed via mobile. Speculators believe that the last 3G users will be taken off with free upgrade offers to help stimulate the transition.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Cortana: Windows 10[/color][/b]\r\nCortana, Microsoft's voice assistance software has received a lot of attention these past few months. In an early preview of Cortana, it is obvious that Cortana is going to be a huge contender for Siri and Google Now. With Cortana, you can start calling on Skype via voice activation, set reminders, and even create a personalized calendar. There is very little latency between when you say the command and when Cortana responds, and Microsoft has hinted at some fun features as well. It is rumored that you can even ask Cortana the question \"Do you like Master Chief,\" and she will reply. Cortana will be a complete desktop navigation extra for Windows 10, and I am sure there are going to be many new features added since it is still in the beta stage.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Microsoft's Voice App No Longer Requires a Smartwatch[/color][/b]\r\nThanks to a recent update, Microsoft's Torque voice search app has become a lot more useful. Before now you had to own an Android smartwatch to use the app, but now it will run perfectly on an Android phone running 4.3 or later without the need of a smartwatch. To activate the voice search, all you have to do is flick your wrist and start talking. It is very accurate as well because it uses the Bing search engine, and it is a refreshing alternative to Google Now.\r\n\n[b][color=white]OneDrive For Android Adds Push Notifications[/color][/b]\r\nFor the people who use Microsoft's OneDrive, you can now get push notifications, With the new update for Android devices, you can work with others more easily, and track changes made to documents with the simple push notifications. You can also set other advanced settings regarding document sharing over the cloud, and you can add thumbnails for files. This new update makes OneDrive on Android overall more stable and convenient to use.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
