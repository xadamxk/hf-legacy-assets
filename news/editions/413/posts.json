The accident took place in a Punjab state on the outskirts of Amritsar, located approximately 300 miles north of New Delhi. In an article by The Press Trust of India, the agency said, “two trains arrived from opposite directions on separate tracks at the same time, giving little opportunity for people to escape,” though the casualties were only caused by one of the trains. \n\nNarendra Modi, Indian’s Prime Minister, released a statement expressing his sadness caused by the accident. Further stating that he has ‘asked officials to provide immediate assistance that is required.’ Raising concern and additional disbelief is a comment by one bystander where they exclaimed “the train didn't even sound its whistle as it sped past the site.” The same witness questions the factor of common sense, wondering why authorities allowed spectators to stand so close to the railroad track, additionally stating that as a result of this occurrence he lost two brothers. Another bystander said the sound of the train was muffled by the unremitting blaring of the fireworks. \n\nChief guest and local politician Navjot Kaur Siddhu said that the festivities take place in the same area every year and railroad authorities are always instructed to run the trains at a dawdling speed; however, it seems that this year’s instructions were either disregarded or were not relayed properly. Immediately after the event ensued, victims were rushed to the hospital to help sustain injuries. “At least 50 injured were admitted to a government-run hospital, the Press Trust of India news agency quoted Rajesh Sharma, a magistrate, as saying. While accidents are relatively common on India's sprawling rail network, Friday's was among the deadliest in recent years. In 2016, 146 people were killed when a train slid off tracks in eastern India.” [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-train-deaths-20181019-story.html]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]Canada now world's largest legal marijuana marketplace[/color][/b]\nAs of 17 October 2018, Canada became the “largest country with a legal national marijuana marketplace as sales.” However, that was not the only good news to be given that day. Just hours before retailed outlets opened their doors, an official told The Associated Press that Canada will be pardoning all convicted felons who possessed up to 30 grams of marijuana, the newfound legal threshold, at the time of arrest. The unnamed official said those who would like to take advantage of the pardons will have to apply. Since 2001 Canada had utilized its resources of medical marijuana, though for two years Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has worked effortlessly to expand the legalization of recreational marijuana. \n\nAccording to The Associated Press, at least 112 legal marijuana dispensaries are expected to open their doors for the 37 million residents of Canada, “with many more to come.” Though with the legalization of recreational marijuana come regulations. A “patchwork of regulations” developed and executed by the federal government takes its own approach is several provinces. Some dispensaries are government-run, the others are private sellers, and some even consist of a hybrid of the two. In comparison to the United States, it seems that the neighbors to the south are years behind this progress. Only nine U.S. states have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and over 30 have approved medical marijuana. \n\nWith the recent acceptance of recreational pot, this raises concerns and enhanced security for border agents. On Tuesday, the day before the announcement was officially proclaimed, “U.S. Customs and Border Protection invited Canadian media to a conference call on Tuesday so officials could reiterate that marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law and that those who are caught at the border with pot are subject to arrest and prosecution.” When looking at the numbers, there are obvious downsides to legal marijuana distribution. Whereas selling weed illegally was not regulated nor taxed, it now is, and there is even an 8 percent cap on retail pot profits. Brenda Tobin is just one of many to bring this up, stating that she and her son do not intend to make an immense profit from marijuana alone, rather making the majority of their profit from “pipes, bongs and marijuana paraphernalia.” [i][size=x-small][url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/canada-now-worlds-largest-legal-marijuana-marketplace-58548374]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=3322334][img]https://i.imgur.com/j0jX3Yy.png[/img][/url][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]A Look Into Helicopter Parenting[/color][/b] \nBeing treated like a child never feels good. Continuously being treated as such has been proven to develop a dependency that is otherwise unneeded. This is only amplified by so-called \"helicopter parents\" from a younger age and far into adulthood in some cases. This article also postulates that these parents are mostly made up of narcissists; being that they need their young one to always be dependent on them in some compacity. The author of this paper ends with encouraging self-awareness to pick out what we could be unintentionally doing to our children. Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was something that managed to catch my eye earlier.

It appears to have quadrupled since 2001. While most parents do still get their children vaccinated if this trend continues we may see the reappearance of long eradicated illnesses. While it may be because of parents not knowing they can receive free vaccination for their children, the actual culprit may be much worse. There is a movement of people that firmly believe vaccinations have been linked to autism from a long-debunked study and are willing to put others at risk because of it.  [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/percentage-of-young-us-children-who-dont-receive-any-vaccines-has-quadrupled-since-2001/2018/10/11/4a9cca98-cd0d-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_source=reddit.com&utm_term=.7503b1a0b6d5&wpisrc=nl_sb_smartbrief]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color][/size][/font]",
