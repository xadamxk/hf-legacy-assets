The new policy enforces a new set of strong rules. Although [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is fully aware this will irritate a lot of members, his response was \"I don't give a fuck\". [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] claimed he won't tolerate this anymore; \"The day has come\". The new policy enforces that no sale threads relating to stressers or booters will be tolerated outside of the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=232][b]Server Stress Testing[/b][/url] forum. Paid stickies will no longer be accepted outside of the subforum -- no exceptions. You are no longer allowed to advertise stressers in anyway shape or form; this includes signatures, usertitles, and even usernames. Only ub3r members may make threads in the subforum as of today, so if you're a l33t or normal member and want to start a stresser, think again. Reasoning behind this policy update is because 99% of the ban evaders come back and create stressers, as well as the hundreds of stressers being released per week. So for stress testing businessmen, this could be seen as a bigger opportunity to make sales. Don't be blinded by this though! Sticky pricing will have a huge increase confirmed by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url].

Hello redpois0n! Welcome to your first interview! Have you got any shout outs to begin with?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for picking me for the interview! I have one special person to shout out for. RAT Setup. He is an amazing guy to work with and you can trust him🙂. There is many members I can shout out to, but I cannot make this list too long 🙂. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] When and why did you join HackForums? What made you stay?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] I joined in November 2011. I was not active on another forum, and I needed someplace to hang around, so I started posting on HF. I cannot really remember why I joined... Must have been attracted by \"Hack\"Forums 🙂. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Your name \"redpois0n\" seems familiar to me because it looks like one of those famous jailbreaking codenames 😝. How exactly did you choose it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] It was a cold winter night on December 27th 2009. I made my YouTube channel, and got inspired by \"greenpois0n\", a famous iOS jailbreak. After a few months when I had my channel on YouTube, another one named \"redpois0nDev\" got created for the redpois0n jailbreak. I always tell people I came up with my name before them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] As I go through your HF profile, I can see you have many awards and even the MD gem; yet you are L33T. It's rare to see someone with stats like yours but who isn't Ub3r. Care to explain? 😝\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] I am permanently denied for ub3r. I don't know why as I am not allowed to ask, but it's Omniscient decision.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I see. Your account still seems pretty prestigious even though you're denied from Ub3r. Talk to me about your career in Java coding. Why do you like it so much?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] Because it's fun and it gives me something to do on my spare time. In 1 month 2 years has passed since I started with my Java career and soon 3 years since I started programming.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I love jRAT, it's simply amazing. Nice work on it. Would you consider it a success? I know you tried selling it before releasing it for free.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] I would consider it a success. In a few days 10 months has passed since I started work on it and I have learned a lot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#7BFF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any plans for the future here on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1049662][color=white][b]redpois0n:[/b][/color][/url] I don't know. I take day for day.

Today, for the 141st edition of the Hack Forums news, we are joined by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870]+Pirate[/url]! Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] All members of Respawn/Innovation, Perfect Cell, Astonish, Ayden, Kentucky and Dolan..\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Oh, no love for the Carrot? Okay 😟\nSo, what was it that first brought you to HF? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] Before HF I had been playing with the software 'Cheat Engine' on various flash games and I was trying to find some different uses for it on various websites but to no luck;before I stumbled onto HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] What made you stick around for as long as you have? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] I saw that there was a whole community left undiscovered with many people who were willing to help out and share their knowledge, which I was eager to learn, and I started to spread out and see the different areas of HF and learning new things.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] As as leader of the ex-Respawn group, you must've been a pretty heavy gamer. What got you into gaming? What are some of your favourite titles?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] Initially (Like post people) I was into the old Pokemon games- Emerald was my first- and from then I started on consoles. I completed the Halo series on the original Xbox more times than I'd care to recount, got all of the skulls and finished it on Legendary. When the XBox 360 game out I got it straight away and finished Halo 3 within about 5 hours of getting a '360. \nEventually the Xbox series started to grow dark and I sold it and bought a PS3 for the convenience of not having to buy for membership.\nAfter joining Respawn my gaming ability really shifted into overdrive.\nAside from just playing on my PS3 I stated to play Runescape again (Started in late 2004 and finally quit earlier this year) and currently I have the most posts in the Runescape section and update the 'precautions' thread regularly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I see. What's your take on the group's transition to \"Innovation\"? A lot of people were very fond of the old gaming, seeing as it was the only official gaming group on HF; do you think people willy take just as well to the new group? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] Although we'll dearly miss our Respawn family, we're hoping to focus more on teaching newer members the skills which we've outlined in our  group description by various methods we're still in the process of planning, but also to gather a collection of knowledgeable individuals who are innovative and can think outside of the box in order to solve a complex problem that they or someone else may be working on.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Will the group be purely invite only, or are you looking to open up recruitment in the future? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] I guess we can let the cat out of the bag now.\n\nFor the most part we will accept some members by invitation when we see that they have proven themselves at semi-regular intervals of one or two members at a time, but we will also hold some recruitment's with a different attitude and method to the conventional methods detailed on HF so far.\nNow for what I think most of HF will be excited for: Similar to the Graphic Masters idea, we will be holding Student recruitment for Innovation in which 20 or so members will be taken under the wings of knowledgeable members of Innovation to learn about a new subject. Each 'Mentor' in our group, as it is called, has selected how many 'Apprentices' they will take at a time and teach them for roughly a month, they will post their weekly progress in a single thread made in each section we're active in, and if they show commitment, they may continue to stay in the group, otherwise they will be removed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I see! So, I think a lot of members are sick and tired of the same old groups being bought then sold a few weeks later. From what you've told me, it looks as if Innovation will be around for a while. Would you agree?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] I think so. We've got a supply of people who would be willing to come in to the group to talk with like-minded individuals, and with the Mentor/Apprentice program we can teach people about different aspects of coding, web management and SEO/Advertising. With any luck we'll constantly both be teaching new members the things which will interest them and seeing members who've shown commitment and potential being added to the group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] How's life on HF being a leader of a group? :P\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] Since we're a new group it's pretty busy organizing everything for what Innovation will be doing and how to manage different things, but otherwise it's nice to be able to help out a group of like-minded individuals in organization and things like that.\nOtherwise I guess it's like being anyone else.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome! Anything you'd like to say to conclude the interview? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=529870][color=white][b]+Pirate:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for interviewing me :)\n[/spoiler]",

The most notable features were included in 13w18a, which include features such as coal blocks, new crafting recipes, and new exploration loot! Coal blocks, similar to other mineral blocks, introduce a more efficient way to store abundances of coal. They can also be placed in furnaces and burn much longer than coal. Coal blocks are crafted the same way as other mineral blocks; coal (not charcoal) must fill the whole 3x3 crafting grid. Hay bales, which received a crafting recipe this snapshot, are crafted in the same fashion but with wheat rather than coal. While some recipes were implemented this week, some were also removed. Horse saddles have been replaced by normal saddles and horse armor can no longer be crafted. Instead, it must be found in dungeon loot chests. Speaking of loot, chests have been added to nether fortresses; they're similar to those found in dungeons. \n\n[color=white][b]Nodus Discontinued as of 1.2.5[/b][/color]\nNodus, the notorious griefing client utilized (and hated) by many, will no longer be updated by Scetch (its original programmer). Since clients are created for server use and active servers regularly update, Nodus will be essentially useless. Being freely available, Nodus was arguably the most easily accessible client on the web. Because of its popularity, however, many avid players belittled those who used it; some would throw insults such as \"turn ur nodus off u skid\" and \"nice nodus n00b lololol\". It was an easy target and a stereotype for many to turn to, and Nodus eventually earned the label of a \"Noob client\", or a client only newer or inexperienced players used. Scetch himself addressed this behavior and the use of Nodus, saying, \"I've seen it [Nodus] grow into something I don't like at all. The Minecraft community has fallen to shit.\" Although many players used Nodus maliciously, some utilized its tools to make creative building easier. With commands such as \"Fastplace\" and \"Fastbreak\", many players found the client useful for non-harmful purposes. RIP Nodus. You will be missed (even if only by few).

Major Nelson confirmed on Twitter that it will be streamed online for any interested gamers. \"Invites to our #E3 Media Briefing went out today,\" wrote Major Nelson. \"Didn't get one? Don't worry - we'll be streaming the show.\" It's going to be huge at E3 this year, with both Microsoft and Song showing more of their consoles to the public.

Michelle Knight was kidnapped in 2002 at age 19 then later, Amanda Berry at age 16 in 2003 and again with Gina DeJesus at age 14 in 2004. Three men have been arrested in connection to the kidnappings. The girls were rescued by a neighbor, Charles Ramsey, who saw the girls frantically trying to escape the seemingly vacant house; from there, the girls and their rescuer alerted the police who arrived to the scene promptly. The families of the victims involved were excited to find out that their children were alright.\n\n[b][color=white]Container Ship Hits Control Tower Resulting in Deaths[/color][/b]\nToday a container ship, the Jolly Nero, crashed into a control tower in Genoa, Italy which resulted in at least three deaths and several missing persons. According to emergency services, large portions of this control tower fell into the sea and it is speculated that as many as 10 may be trapped inside the fallen parts of the tower. Prosecutors in Genoa are investigating the situation and the container ship has been impounded. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined as a human or mechanical error. Port Authority President Luigi Merlo told local TV that \"It's a terrible tragedy. We're in turmoil, speechless,” \n\n[b][color=white]US and Russia Agree to Hold a Conference on Syria[/color][/b]\nThe US and Russia have now agreed to work together to find a solution to the Syrian conflict.

A user would simply have to open a stream to a music file and the physical file would be downloaded to the user's computer. This would only work in Spotify's web based interface, play.spotify.com, however. Shortly after the news was released, the Spotify developers pushed a fix that closed the bug.

In one of his songs, he has offensive lyrical references to Civil Rights figure Emmett Till. Emmet Till was in his teens when horrible things happened to him in 1955. He was tortured and lynched for whistling at a Caucasian female in 1955. Lil Wayne tried apologizing for his acts, but he has lost his promotion deal with Mountain Dew. The founding company of Mountain Dew, PepsiCo, stated, \"We do not plan any additional work with Lil Wayne moving forward. His offensive reference to a revered civil rights icon does not reflect the values of our brand.\" Wayne believed his lyrics was just \"word play\" and he wasn't trying to make fun or harm anyone during the song. The family and relatives of Emmet still did not appreciate the apology, but instead took action; they did the best they could to hit him where it hurts. The family tried to take the best from him -- his money. Lil Wayne is not the only artist who was cut from the program. Rick Ross and Tyler, the Creator's also lost endorsement opportunities. This is a warning to other artists who would like to take part as a spokesman.\n\n[color=white][b]Tupac Shakur's Godmother Added to FBI Most-Wanted Terrorists List[/b][/color]\nRecently Tupac Shakur's Godmother was added to the FBI Most-Wanted Terrorists List. Currently, she is the first woman and the first domestic terrorist on the list. Joanne Chesimard, now known as Assata Shakur, was convicted of a crime in 1977. Joanne Chesimard, a.k.a. Assata Shakur had murdered a 34-year-old state trooper named Werner Foerster. After she was convicted, she escaped prison in 1979 and ran away to hide in Cuba. She's supposedly a danger to the U.S and she constantly went against the government and started various revolutions. As of now, there is no evidence or proof that she did this and caused the death of the officer. Lennox S. Hinds, who defended Joanne during her trial, stated, \"The allegation that Ms. Shakur is a terrorist is unfounded. . . . The attempt at this point by the New Jersey State Police to characterize her as a terrorist is designed to inflame the public who may be unfamiliar with the facts.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Do Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez Still Have Feelings for Each Other?[/b][/color]\nThe dynamic duo, not consisting of Justin and Ludacris, but Justin and Selena Gomez, has gotten a lot of people fired up, and a lot of hearts to go \"aww!\" Justin posted a picture of the two sitting next to each other and holding her in a huddle. The two looked happy next to each other and they both seemed to be enjoying their time together. Surprisingly enough, Justin did not delete the photo of the two like he did with a previous photo. No one knows if the two are dating, but both of them seem to still have a thing for each other. The two have gone on-and-off with their love, but some people think it's hurting their image. The two often use social media sites just like average teenagers would, and this is where most of their drama had occurred. Justin's just like any other male teen; he likes girls, loves being with friends, and he has his ups and downs here and there. Selena's trying to forget everything that happened between the two now that she's trying to move on from the girlish pop look. They're both young, but they do not know the true meaning of love, and they possibly won't until they grow up and realize what they're doing.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGIgXP9SvB8[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Ol.jpg[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nThere was a lot of confusion during this week's release and I'd like to apologize for it.

      "message": "[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1OI.jpg[/img][/align]\n\n\"What do you honestly think of the upcoming changes in the Reputation System?\"\n\n[i]\"With the impending removal of the custom reputation system, there \nwill surely be commotion in regards to no longer being able to provide \nyour specific opinion on somebody. This surely simplifies the process of \nreputations, and removes the need for a reputation abuse system. The \nproblem is people just trying to be assholes can scroll down the list of \nreps and choose a random one. Omniscient plans on giving a wide array \nof options, so that is good for people taking the system seriously trying \nto choose a valid reasoning to give someone a reputation. While we are \nwaiting for Omni to roll out new the system/plugin he is coding, and \ndesigning it seems people are abusing the fact the there are no current \nenforcers of reputation abuse as per Judge Dredd's demotion to Mentor; \nthis is causing an influx of reputation abuse threads in the Rules/feedback \nsection, as the reputation abuse forum has been removed. I have a \npositive outlook on the potential of preset reputation choices, as opposed \nto the current custom system.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][i]-Kray[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Honestly I think it has it's good and bad aspects. Since \nit is set what you can say, that will definitely take care of most of the \nharassment. Although, it really takes away your freedom of speech. We \nare entitled to say whatever we want, and with this system we are very \nlimited. So down to the point, I don't like it, but I don't disagree with it. \nHowever it is Omni's decision, and I think it will work.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1228039][i]-Daedalus™[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"In my honest opinion, I think this is a very controversial topic. This will \nbenefit some, while hurting others. Personally, I think this is a bad idea \nconsidering the reputation abuse that will be allowed. The good thing about \nthe current system is that you can spot reputation abuse. For example, if \na user reps you with \"GO DI3 IN A HOLE friend\", then you can easily spot \nabuse. In the new system, the rep will be something like this \"I dislike this \nuser\". I think the new system will bring a new 'fresh' feel with rep and \ncleanliness in the reputation page for members. Although I do think there \nwill be minor issues like stated above.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1498588][i]-WaterSpice[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"The new reputation system has been unexpected. I am \nneither for or against the change. I guess it will solve one problem which \nis abuse, but create others such as specific reputation where people add \na URL etc. I think it will generalize reputation and it may be able to be \ncategorized and statistically shown. Personally I don't think there is a real \nproblem with the current reputation system, but hey, people like change!\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=823754][i]-McDork[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"How do you feel about the new policy involving Booters and Stressers?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://puu.sh/2G1Pn.jpg[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibrwxbCVBTUP5w.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1PQ.jpg[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/YqMgdwi.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/KVsnJq9.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/PYJyGQN.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Qu.jpg[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121196]Natha[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/Y2HFq]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=469528]Odin the Wanderer[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody‍[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711]D3xus[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193]Connected[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854]CarrotMilk[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editor[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426]+Awesome[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody‍[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021]Retribute[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
