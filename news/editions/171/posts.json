Get lost in a world of Sir, as our wonderful forum is laden with the merry face of our Supreme One. All you must do, is take [url=http://i.imgur.com/BCf0M7w.png]this[/url] avatar and place it as your own. Think of this day as a forum-wide masquerade ball, and enjoy everything it has to offer.

Those members who have been around for a while may remember groups such as the Rat's Crew, The Wraiths, or even Propitious. With each group comes a leader, or in some cases, multiple leaders. A thread was made this week by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] stating that he officially only recognizes one leader per group, one person who can make changes, sell, or make decisions for the group. Although a leader may choose to appoint other members for leadership positions or tasks, it is important to note that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] only listens to a singular member; the group owner him/herself. This means that members should think twice, three times, and perhaps even a fourth time before splitting the costs of a group between two or more people in order to acquire the funds needed to purchase one. In the end, it could turn out very unfavorably for them. You can read the thread, along with the comments, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3888197]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]GameStop Fraud Disallowed[/b][/color]\nWith a new Christmas approaching, another item has been added to the disallowed items list that seems to grow by one every year. In the previous years, this list has seen additions such as Amazon Kindles, Apple products, and more recently Beats headphones. Now, it's time to add GameStop coupons to the growing array, following a thread made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] stating the change. The members participating in this illicit behavior have been banned, and the advice is to spread the word to other members so that they may avoid accidentally meeting the same daunting fate. Included in this ban are, of course, services related to the GameStop PowerUp Rewards program as well. The thread made by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] detailing the change can be read [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3891987]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]JTag Section Warning[/b][/color]\nLast week saw the addition of the JTag/RGH Mods section in the XBOX 360 area. As pleased as most members were with the change, some have used the opportunity in a negative manner, sparking site owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] to create a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3889783]thread[/url] stating that although the section is for the discussion of XBOX 360 modification, it is most certainly not for any activity relating to or involving warez or illegal copyrighted downloads, which applies to all other areas of Hack Forums as well. Although this is not a new rule by any means, members may consider this reminder a warning and a chance to avoid an accidental banning or account closure. Topics should cover hardware modification, the requirements and legitimate downloads needed for modifications, and homebrew software intended for legal use. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] warns that should this activity not cleanse itself from the section in rapid succession, he may end up closing the section altogether.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iyobmhGt2yol0.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453][color=white][b]Chris[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a Staff member.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815][color=#00AAFF][b]Nаte[/b][/color][/url] reached 1,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=454666][color=#00AAFF][b]adampelletgun[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a Mentor.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1292605][color=#00AAFF][b]Skorp[/b][/color][/url] reached 1,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=#EFEFEF][b]+Awesome[/b][/color][/url] has participated in 50 HF News editions.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=323740][color=#EFEFEF][b]Positive[/b][/color][/url] reached 2,000 reputation points.

Today we're interviewing +Awesome. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] Not anyone particular. Though I'd like to thank everyone who has supported me, critisized, and appreciated. They all helped me improve significantly in the past year. Thank you guys.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So let's get started. First off, what brought you to Hackforums almost 3 years ago?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] I was like 16 when I joined HF. I was looking for hacking tutorials, and somehow found HF through a youtube video. Though I'm not into hacking anymore.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I noticed you're into graphics. How long have you been doing graphic work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] It's been a while. I started around 2 years back, playing around with photoshop, making free signatures and threads. Then I opened my design shop, made 100's of threads and designed all those basic logos. 10 gbs of personally made graphics :P And I've been learning since then.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well from the bit of profile stalking I did on you, you've made some really awesome stuff. So you're one of the graphical editors for the news team, correct? Tell us a bit about how that came to be.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I remember I started designing for HF News from Christmas 2012. Since then I've finished 50 editions including this one. I also made new layouts for about 25 editions I believe. It was really an awesome experience.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] But all good things must come to an end. Would you like to deliver the news, or should I?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah it's been a great journey. This is my final edition for HF News. It's time to move on for more stuff waiting for me out there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] This is so sad! Bad Meets Evil is the other gfx designer. Do you think he can hold down the fort or will he need helping hands? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] I believe he can do this on his own if he wants to. Good luck mate.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So over the course of 50 editions what has been your most enjoyable moment. I know working on the news team gets boring sometimes, but every once in a while you find yourself having a good time creating content for the community to enjoy. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] Haha yeah, it was the best times when I participated in the group discussions and stuff within different groups. But then things changed, I had real life work and different internships. Had no time left for that fun stuff. But it was really fun seeing some people improve over this time. Week by week, new improved stuff. Least I could do to motivate them is by putting their works in the latest edition.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome, (pun intended). Which brings me to my next question, why the username +Awesome?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] Haha I thought you'd ask that. I really don't know why exactly. But I was just obsessed with the word Awesome, and I was learning programming back then, I thought I'd increment Awesomeness, but I just end up putting up one + instead instead of two. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So before you go wandering into your new life, tell us about the man behind the username. What's he like?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] There's been many people asking me same question, and I just wrote [url=http://gbaheti.me/blog/about]Things you should know about me.[/url] Have a look.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well you're certainly a determined individual. I wish you best of luck wherever the future may take you. Anything else to say before you go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426][color=white][b]+Awesome:[/b][/color][/url] Nah that should do. Thanks a lot mate. :)[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245]Phenomenal[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hello everyone! Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News! Today I'm here with Proud Canadian and one of Voids leaders; Phenomenal! Thanks for joining us today Phenomenal, do you have any shoutout's you'd like to make before we begin? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you Clark. I would definitely like to send a shout out to Hexicidal, Viral Dragon, Kosmos and everyone else in Void! Also any Canadians on here. ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Right on. So why don't you tell us a little bit about your relationship with Void? How does Void compare to other groups on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url]  Despite not being as active in it as I would like, I love Void. When Hex sold Logic to Sandshrew and myself, I was so sad. I thought it was going to be a good change, but it just spiralled out of control. When Hex and I got the group back it was just a magnificent day. Void is so different from every other group. It is relaxed, but at the same time everything and everyone in the group is high quality. The discussions that happen in that subforum are excellent and I enjoy reading them immensely. I would like another group with similar objectives which would maybe spark interest in the SRPP section and possibly turn into a friendly rivalry, but I feel like that may be hopeful thinking.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That would be an interesting concept. Similar to Skill vs Instinct, just with a SRPP theme. So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, that would be my hope. I found Hack Forums in a pretty cliche way; I was looking for RATs. Once I figured out how they work and everything I realized they just weren't for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah, that seems to be the story for majority of the newcomers here (myself included). So once you learned RATing wasn't for you, what kept you coming back?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] The marketplace fascinates me. I've been in and out of it for a long time, and am almost ready to get back into it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah HF has an amazing marketplace. What kind of goods interest you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] For purchasing, there is no real one area that interests me. I find gems in all the sections that I purchase once in a while. For selling, I have mostly been in the stress testing business. I plan on releasing a new stresser soon actually. I also plan on getting into currency exchange with a partner of mine. Hopefully both products/services will be hitting the market within the next month.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Awesome! I'm sure it will be a huge hit (pun intended). Who's your partner if you don't mind me asking?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] For the stresser there is Hexicidal and Bandors. For currency exchanging I will be getting together with jaykoby7. I am excited to work with all of them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Sounds like a full proof team. Since you've been here for a few years now, I'd like to ask what do you believe could be done differently on HF to better everyone's experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you. I honestly don't know if anything should be done differently on here. Omni is a very competent admin and even if it feels like he is doing something in spite of the community it is usually a good choice on his part.  \nEvery once in a while you can really see his anger come out, but he is human and it happens. As for the site itself, I quite like it and don't think there is anything I would change if I could.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Absolutely, very well said. So are there any other goals you'd like to accomplish on Hack Forums? What was your most memorable moment on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] I once had a chance to join the HJT team and I didn't take it as seriously as I should have. I would one day like to get a shot at joining MRT. I don't really have any goals on here besides that.    My most memorable moment on HF was when Omni decided to sell Coders after Honor Et Veritas decided to bail on the group. I messaged Hex because he posted saying he was interested in buying the group. We decided to purchase it together. When I sent that payment to Omni, and we got the group.. that was great. We started Logic with the group and it was an amazing group. It is pretty much the precursor to Void.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] MRT is an amazing group, they do a lot of work for everyone. Best of luck with that Phenomenal. Well I'd like to thank you for joining us here today, if you have any final thoughts you'd like to leave us with now's the time.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=117245][color=white][b]Phenomenal:[/b][/color][/url] I don't think so, just thank you for the interview!

I am doing well, thanks for offering me this interview. Shououts to Devour, Blam, Saturday, THL, Tendo Pain, Burt Reynolds, Lethal, Abel, and I know I am missing quite a few people but that was who I remembered right off the top of my head.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Awesome! What brought you to the site? I know you're pretty active in gamertags/online accounts sections. Can you tell us a bit about that?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] Well ironically enough that was not the initial reason I joined. My buddy and I were playing the MLG playlist on Halo 3 and we were really close to getting our 50s. Then we ran into a group of cheaters who would not stop DDoSing us. My friend told me we could even the playing field by getting a booter. I asked where. Then he had told me HackForums. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] So, did your friend have an HF account too? If so, does he still visit the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=130384 \nIronically we never ended up purchasing a booter at all. I surfed HF for a while and discovered the gamertag section. Which at the time was at its best then. There was a fresh gamertag reset and there were still original names that could be claimed.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Were you around when Jays Booter was popular? Ah.. Miss those days. What made you choose your name? Is that just your online alias, or is there something else? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] indeed I was. Good ol' Jay's Booster (Hexiah still uses it) Haha  My name I chose, simply because I am a huge science and astronomy  nerd. They were always my favorite subjects in school and I am fascinated by space and how large the universe is. The planet Saturn is easily one of the most distinguished planets due to the fact that it is the only planet of the 3 that contain rings, in our solar system, that are very visible.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's  actually pretty cool man. What are your hobbies outside of HF?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] Well to be honest I work a lot so I don't have as much time to do the things I enjoy. My old hobbies were video games (spent wayyy to much time on Xbox) and I used to be a solid bowler (I used to go 3 nights a week and my average game was a 210). Nowadays, my time spent outside of work goes to friends family and my girlfriend.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Ah, true. Since you've been registered on HF for quite a bit, do you have any memorable accomplishments on the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] Two things immediately come to mind about 2 months ago I hit my 5k post milestone that I thought would never happen and secondly, TheHackersLove invited me into Infamous. It is imo the best group to be in. There is a strong bond between most Infamous members and it is a unique group that I am very proud to represent.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's great to hear. Congratulations! Do you have any plans for the future? Either off site or in real life?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] Well I currently work for a large west coast grocery chain... it is employee owned and rapidly expanding. I have been moving my way up towards the top and am hoping to become a store manager eventually. The job starts at roughly $125k a year salary plus bonuses. And I would really like it if my girlfriend could just be a stay at home mom and not have to work and finances were not an issue, as that has been the story of my life since I was a small child, growing up with parents who constantly fought over money issues.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Well, sounds like you have quite the plan. Do you plan on upgrading to the new systems? Also, what did you get for Black Friday?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] I would like an Xbox One, primarily because the new Killer Instinct is an exclusive title for it, and I have been a huge KI fan since it debuted way back for the SNES. As for black Friday, I got my computer last year on black Friday and I don't really need anything for myself so I went Christmas shopping on black friday for family and friends. There was only one thing that I did get myself... I collect rare Hot Wheels cars, and Walmart brought in a sick new lot of them, so while everyone was waiting in those massive lines for the registers, I gathered treasure hunt (rare) Hot Wheels and stashed them under a bunch of the produce tables (since nobody goes there), then came back in a couple hours after the lines died down and bought all my treasure hunts. 13 treasure hunts in total, which any Hot Wheel collector knows, that's like winning the lottery, you're lucky to find one on any other day.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I remember getting a new car every weekend (Back when they were .97 each). That's pretty cool man. Getting the Xbone on Christmas? What games would you get? I'm pretty disappointed that you can't play old games.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] Here they are still 97¢ each.  Unfortunately not, I won't be getting a console for Christmas. Video games have not been a necessity lately. I just bought a 2012 Civic LX, so that's where the money has been going. Also, I was quite disappointed by the fact that none of the new next gen consoles offer backwards compatibility. If I do end up getting an XB1 I would be getting Killer Instinct, and the New Halo even though it will most likely be bad like Reach and Halo 4\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True, Halo 5 is actually going out late in '14. So you have some time to spare. We're coming to the end of our interview. Anything you'd like to say before we're done?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879232]Saturn[/url]:[/b][/color] I'd like to thank you for interviewing me. Another quick shout out to all of Infamous, Burt Reynolds, Noxious, and the rest of the gamertag community. There are a lot of great people I have met on this site and I have enjoyed my time thus far on HF.[/spoiler]",

The chosen developer, even with their many years of Cricket game development experience, was unable to overcome the unexpected challenges that the chosen game engine threw up, even with multiple extensions to the development schedule. At the start of the project, 505 Games received all assurances from the developer that the engine was up to the task of creating a dynamic, cutting-edge cricket game for the modern age across multiple platforms, and unfortunately those assurances were found to be misplaced.\" \"The net result of the challenges we have faced was a game which, despite our best efforts over the course of a 2 year development, couldn’t meet the quality benchmarks of either us, our licencors or our customers. 505 Games’ main priority right now is to protect the Ashes name and that of the ECB and Cricket Australia, and do what we can to recompense the cricket community.\" \"As the licensee and publisher of name for Ashes Cricket 2013, 505 Games would like to apologize publicly and sincerely to our licensors, the ECB and Cricket Australia, and their respective partners/sponsors, who have been nothing but patient and supportive of us throughout the challenges this project has presented, and who, ultimately, we have let down.\" \"Our deepest apologies, however, are reserved for the fans of cricket and cricket games worldwide. 505 Games prides itself on being a safe pair of hands on which gamers of all tastes and denominations can rely to put their best foot forward to create compelling gaming experiences. It is clear that, in this instance, we have fallen way short of our stated aims and failed to deliver. We know that the mitigating factors, as highlighted above, hold little solace to the hordes of excited cricket fans worldwide who had hoped this year to be able to play out their fantasy of playing in the Ashes series.\" 505 Games said they will contact users shortly with refund details.\n\n[color=white][b]Valve Announces Steam Reviews[/b][/color]\nValve has announced a new system where users can reviews games on their platform. The new system is currently in beta, but can be accessed by all users. \"Now it's easy to see what other Steam users think about a product before you buy. With Steam Reviews, you can browse for reviews that others have found helpful, or write your own reviews for titles you've played on Steam.\" Users can review any game or software they want on the service, including free-to-play games and special weekends. Reviews can be sorted in many ways, including popularity, language and more. Reviews will not carry a number, however Valve stated they are looking to add this sometime during the beta period. Valve also stated that the metacritic scores will stay. You can read more about the review system [url=http://store.steampowered.com/reviews/]here[/url]. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThe Red Dragon posted his impressions of the Xbox One. He says the good and bad things about the console.\n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYUpxeqFvoM[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Snapshot 13w48b-- A 1.7.3 Pre-Release[/color][/b]\nIn attempt to fix bugs from 1.7.2, Mojang has decided to push out one of their experimental snapshots to test it out. It's been said, then, that the newest snapshot is being identified as a 1.7.3 pre-release. Though not much is being changed, it's always nice to come back to a bug-free Minecraft after an update. The snapshot has even been referred to as a \"small bug-fix snapshot,\" so don't quite hope for anything major on this one. Perhaps when 1.7.3 arrives, we might see something new.\n\n[b][color=white]Continued Effort on PS3 Minecraft Throughout the Holidays[/color][/b]\nFollowing [url=https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/406525513050497024]a Tweet[/url] from 4J Studios, the developers of Minecraft for Xbox 360 (and now PS3), it's been made clear that there truly is an effort being made to have the PS3 version of the game ready before all else is progressed. It's been previously stated, then, that other platforms won't even see a patch update, texture pack, or skin pack until the game is finished and ready for release on the PS3. Surely, though, once released on the PS3, next-gen consoles will receive some thought.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nFollowing [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3887710]a thread made by Omniscient[/url], it's been made clear that some more effort is being put into HackerCraft after the strenuous load being put on to HF recently. That being said, it's equally likely that the HackerCraft news will resume as activity rises.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]SkyDoesMinecraft[/color][/b]\nEver hear of SkythekidRS and want to have a better chance of seeing him in-game? If so, it's likely that will happen if you participate in his server. He offers mini-games such as Hunger Games, Ghostbusters, Creative, Blockhunt, and much more. If you're ever interested in playing them or seeing him and his friends, check the server out at skga.me!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibx5gFlLxx9bJ1.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]United Kingdom Web Filters to Block “Extremist Views”[/b][/color]\nJames Brokenshire, UK Security Minister, notified journalists of pending censorship policies to be announced in the near future which would censor extremist websites and “empower a specialist unit to identify and report content deemed too dangerous for online publication” (via [url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/27/ministers-order-isps-block-terrorist-websites][i]The Guardian[/i][/url]). Internet Service Provider sources warned about potential freedom of speech issues with such a policy change and other critics of the policy invoked images of similar steps taken by Iran and Russia prior to massive censorship campaigns blew up in their respective countries. The policy's intent is to diffuse Islamic extremism which has been a concern of the country for the past few years.\n\n[color=white][b]US Challenges China in East China Sea[/b][/color]\nA few days after [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3890613&pid=36574071#pid36574071]we reported on China's claim over the Senkaku Islands[/url] in the East China Sea, the United States flew two B-52 bombers in an act of defiance. China set up an “identification zone” over the islands requiring all aircraft entering the area to receive permission from the Chinese military. As of this writing, China has not made a public statement regarding the US's move. The territorial dispute began in the early 1970's over a large gas deposits were discovered beneath the uninhabited islands.\n\n[color=white][b]Italian Senate Expels Berlusconi[/b][/color]\nComplying with a new anti-corruption law, ex-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was expelled from the Italian Senate due to being convicted of tax fraud and soliciting an underage prostitute. Two days after having his position revoked, an Italian court accused him of paying off a witness. Because Berlusconi is over 70, he will likely avoid direct imprisonment and instead be required to complete a year of community service.\n\n[color=white][b]NSA Spies on Porn Habits to Discredit Radicalizers[/b][/color]\nA recently released Snowden file revealed that the United States' National Security Agency has been compiling profiles of potential extremists which could be used to discredit and undermine an extremist cause. One prominent aspect of this proposed plan is keeping a record of online porn habits which could be used to embarrass a potential enemy and make it difficult to radicalize others. The released document contained a list of six Muslim individuals along with their compiled profiles, however does not indicate whether or not the plan to discredit them was carried through.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Robotic Sea Turtle To Map Shipwrecks That Humans Cannot Get To[/b][/color]\nThe Tallinn Institute of Technology is developing a new underwater robot called the U-CAT. While most shipwrecks are too dangerous for humans to get to, U-CAT could serve as a good way to explore them and see what's inside because of it's small size and and the use of flippers instead of propellers. This prevents the robot from kicking up silt and disrupting it's cameras. It will eventually be used to map shipwrecks, after more extensive testing.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Play Now Highlights Chromecast-Friendly Apps[/b][/color]\nGoogle has started a process to highlight Chromecast-friendly Android apps on the Play Store. This has been seen before when they started to highlight tablet-native apps. This new section in the Play Store has very little selection of apps at the moment, but will supposedly grow greater in the near future. This could  up the popularity of the Chromecast, as well as make it easier for users to stream content to their tv.\n\n[color=white][b]Text Message Exploit Can Mess Up Your Nexus Phone[/b][/color]\nUsers of the Nexus line of smartphones are experiencing trouble from an exploit found recently. This exploit involves sending a flood of texts to the person's phone & causing all sorts of problems. It mainly causes the phone to reboot, but it has also been said to disable the network connection and crash the messaging app. All other phones that aren't a Nexus seem to be safe and ok to use, but most users should stay cautious for now. There is no word yet on when a patch will come through to fix this.\n\n[color=white][b]Gigaset To Start Making Android Tablets[/b][/color]\nThe German company Gigaset, who is known for their cordless phones, are currently working on launching the its first tablets. These tablets are 8 inches and 10 inches and will each be aimed at different audiences. The 10-inch tablet will be for those who want more power and storage, featuring a 2560 x 1600 display, 16GB of expandable storage, and an 8-megapixel rear camera. The device also features a quad-core Tegra 4 processor, clocked at 1.8GHz.\nThe less expensive tablet will feature an 8-inch screen with the resolution being 1024 x 768. This tablet has a 5 megapixel rear camera, as well as 8GB of expandable storage. The 8-inch tablet also has a 1.2GHz quad-core MediaTek chip. They will be available in early December for a price of $271 and $502, respectively.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Eminem Released Music Video for \"Rap God\"[/color][/b]\nWatch Eminem walk on water in the 'Rap God' video, plugging into \"The Matrix\". The six-minute video opens with Em, done up like the popular 1980s television character Max Headroom, mouthing the words from an old Captain America audiobook sample, with a static sound in the background. Slim Shady has often given nods to pop culture icons and moments in his videos. Michael Jackson, Marilyn Manson, Elvis Presley and comic hero Robin have all been represented in Em's collection of eye-popping clips, and \"Rap God\" follows tradition. \"As the video begins to close, Em really sets himself apart from the pack and assumes his mantle as a rhyme deity as he walks across water in a clear biblical reference. 'Why be a king, when you can be a God?' he asks before collapsing from apparent rhyme exhaustion,\" according to MTV. \n\n[color=white][b]Why Aren't Big Sean Or Pusha T On The Yeezus Tour? Kanye Tries To Explain[/b][/color]\nDuring an explosive interview with Sway, Kanye explains he's not 'marginalized' by G.O.O.D. Music. It's been a remarkable year for G.O.O.D. Music. Not only did Kanye West release his groundbreaking Yeezus LP, but 2 Chainz, Big Sean and Pusha T all released albums in conjunction with Kanye's label. So why didn't West decide to bring any of his artists with him on his Yeezus Tour? Kanye stated, \"Well, every artist that makes good music is on G.O.O.D. Music,\" Kanye reasoned before rattling off a list of names. \"Drake on G.O.O.D. Music, Wayne on G.O.O.D. Music, James Blake on G.O.O.D. Music, Frank Ocean on G.O.O.D. Music. You make good music, you're on G.O.O.D. Music, in my mind.\" Kanye provides a ton of creative direction and inspiration for his team, but he also encourages them to be their own artists he says. \"Everybody gotta get their own — maybe it's just a piano that I bring in for John Legend and executive produce that. Maybe it's an art package that I do for Pusha or beg him to take a certain song off that I think sounds too commercial,\" he said referencing Pusha's My Name is My Name album, though he didn't name the song which he begged the Clipse MC to remove from the album. Though everything within the G.O.O.D. Music crew seems to be harmonious, Kanye does say that he wasn't too happy with [u]Big Sean's Hall of Fame LP[/u], which he released in August, which isn't very surprising. \n\n[color=white][b]Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Suffers Second-Week Chart Drop, Eminem Back On Top[/b][/color]\nGaga's ARTPOP dipped by 82 percent in week two! After a months-long pre-release promotional blitz that spanned the globe and made use of nearly every medium possible, Queen Monster will lay claim to a chart record this week when ARTPOP  suffers a big second-week slide. Eminem battled back into the #1 spot with The Marshall Mathers LP 2 , which will be back at #1 despite dropping another 43 percent as sales hit 120,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Em has moved more than 1.1 million units in three weeks, which is extremely phenomenal. Em held down the #1 spot on the Billboard Digital Songs chart, where it sold another 241,000, more than enough to keep Lorde's \"Royals\" at #2 (177,000). Otherwise the top 10 was just a shuffling of the deck, as OneRepublic's \"Counting Stars\" fell one to #3 (167,000), Pitbull's \"Timber\" held at #4 (166,000) and Imagine Dragons stayed put at #5 with \"Demons\" (124,000). The only big mover was A Great Big World's hook-up with Christina Aguilera, \"Say Something,\" which was up six to #6 as sales shot up 59 percent to 121,000.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nLimitations. Humanity is peculiar. We set our own limitations through beliefs, ideals, and choices. Truth is that all things are possible. Limitations are falsehoods sewn within ourselves from birth. All it takes for one to succeed and become superior to his or her older self is to cast off the shackles of doubt and pick the wool from each eye. All it takes to become that which you want, is to simply become. There are no real limitations, one can overcome. Humanity may have built its own barrier of restriction, but not without leaving an ember or two for an inferno of recreation. Those who have been great, have recognized this. It is up to you whether or not you will be great.",
