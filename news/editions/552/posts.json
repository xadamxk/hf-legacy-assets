This section will grow over time to more things, but for now we are just going to be doing Song of the week. We are open to what more we could bring to the section from your suggestions, but as a start, we feel adding the song of the week will be a great start for the section and lead the way forward for more things in the future.[/b]\n\n[b]Now we know some of you may question what the song of the week is all about, and we have thought of what a great answer. We feel like the song of the week should be a meaningful song that goes deeper than just general music and has meaning to it all. Granted, we may have a little fun with it sometimes. (Yes, we will have a Halloween version and Christmas version too.) But we want to keep it at a level where we have found the song has a true message behind it all and not just something that everyone will just see as another song that is just a bit catchy or got a good few beats to it. We hope this helps those with that question and if anyone has anything that they wish to ask, please feel free to add them below. We are more than happy to give the reason behind it.[/b]\n\n[b][size=large][color=#ffffff]This weeks Song Of The Week:[/color][/size][/b]\n\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_nc1IVoMxc&list=RDs_nc1IVoMxc&start_radio=1&pp=ygUGSGkgcmVuoAcB[/video]\n\n[hr]\n\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/contests.png[/img]\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=3929084]\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6305248]\n$100 USD (BTC) Contest || Celebrating My Acceptance in The Academy[/url] By [mention=4189082] [/color][/size][/b][/u]\n\nA new contest has been created this week by @W1NK1LL3RX.
