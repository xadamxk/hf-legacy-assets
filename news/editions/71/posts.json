There were mixed responses to this change; however the majority of them were negative. In response to the negative statements directed towards the user bar one of the leaders, Astonish is NJ, wrote “We symbolize help not looks.” Implying that they are more concerned with the content they produce than the members’ opinions of the userbar. In the end they decided to return to the original userbar.\n\n[b]Two million threads[/b]\nOn December 10th Hackforums finally reached its two millionth thread. This is a huge milestone for the community and Hack Forums itself. In only a few years Hack Forums has become one of the most well-known forums on the internet, and this couldn’t have been accomplished without the community as a whole and of course Omniscient himself.\n\n[b]1000 posts[/b]\nThe popular unofficial group ‘Team Qwazz’ has recently achieved 1000 posts in their recruitment thread. They are one of the first unofficial groups to obtain this achievement and it is truly something to be proud of. You can read through the recruitment thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1258349]here[/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://goo.gl/nctCW[/img][/align]\n\n\"How do you feel about the 'Post here, PM me' threads? Should they be banned, or is the new pmme code a good fix?\"\n\n[i]\"In my opinion, \"Post here and PM me\" is the best way to avoid giveaways to members that\n have negative reputation. In my \"Giveaway Threads\", a rule is to post on my thread, so it keeps\n active, and finally PM me. I also put requirements for normal users, such as having more positive\n reputation. Because, from my personal experience, non-upgraded members with negative reputation\n leech your work saying that they have done it. To be honest, the PM code is a better way to order\n the giveaway item. It's quicker and more effective.\"[/i]\n[url=http://goo.gl/IJ9NX][i]-Dяea[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Post here, PM threads is just a way for the person to feed the user what they want to\n tell you, or to allow others to know about what is going on within the thread. The Post here just s up\n thier thread to get more views and more possible victims. I have seen some major scams happen within\n these types of threads, due to the SE able to be done through possibly by the PM me area of the thread,\n so other people and MODs can't see strait what the user is stating, or trying to get the person to do. Also\n fake websites can be distrubuted like this also (Include Viruses Also) That is the best way I can state my\n opinion, but I do NOT support the Post here, PM me threads. I think they should have a rule against them.\"[/i]\n[url=http://goo.gl/bRg8Q][i]-tylerwazhere[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I think that when people do \"Post here and PM ME\" in their threads, it is mainly to get rep. I have had\n many people reply with the product i was after saying Enjoy the product, any thanks in appreciated which\n is blatantly asking for reputation. It seems like something that won't stop people from trying to gain rep.\n The new code won't stop this as it is only a shortcut to scrolling down and saves a small amount of writing\n in the body and subject; which won't stop people from subtly asking for rep. \"[/i]\n[url=http://goo.gl/NpdiU][i]-+Pirate[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I honestly don't see a point in the 'post here, pm me' threads, nor do I think the new pmme\n code is a good fix. Members that create threads with post here then pm me are pretty much creating more\n hastle for themselves. They have to put up with sending whatever it is to every member that pms them. It's\n not an effective way of acomplishing anything as they're still going to send it to everyone that pms them, so\n why not just post a download link? The pmme code isn't much of a fix either as it just makes it easier to get\n to the pm screen.\"[/i]\n[url=http://goo.gl/3YKP3][i]-Рurple Haze[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I feel that \"Post here and PM me threads\" are major waste of resources. They obviously contain some quality\n information in the OP but that were the details of the things being given away which can be considered as quality\n information. After the OP not even a single post is quality post. All posts are like \"Hi, I would really love to have\n this. Thanks in advance.\" This was however the compulsion for others & they did it. Obviously everyone knows\n how important these posts are. This doesn't end here, The reply to those PMs sometimes contain \"Thanks is\n appreciated\" & other phrases hinting for rep which is also a severe abuse to reputation system. In my opinion\n they must be banned for saving time & resources & to reduce reputation abuse and I'm pretty sure that if these\n posts in junk get purged then site is again going to lose thousands of posts. If your giveaway is really worth it\n then you're automatically going to get respect from the users. When it comes to the new pmme mycode, Most\n users are very happy with it. This will be very handy for the threads in the marketplace but is not a good fix for\n 'Post here, PM me' threads.\"[/i]\n[url=http://goo.gl/DPNbA][i]-Brilliant[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think that the new pmme code is good, I have always wondered why this wasn't added earlier. It\n gives a sort of direction to members, now they don't have to try and guess what the subject of the private message\n should be about as much. As for these topics, I do not agree with them. There shouldn't be people who say \"Post\n here and PM me for ___\", instead it should be a mere PM or a simple post. I understand that a PM is to keep the\n original poster updated and the posts to keep the thread ed. Really, it is starting to get out of hand though.\"[/i]\n[url=http://goo.gl/9eZWx][i]-AlbinoShadow[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"Seeing as there is currently limitations for you to be able to post in the marketplace, do you agree with those? Or are they too strenuous?\" \n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://goo.gl/Bkvmj[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]War Ending in Iraq[/b][/color]\nThe U.S. military mission that began in 2003 is ending this month, and Obama used the speech to mark the fulfillment of a campaign pledge he made in 2008 to end the war. Noting the almost 4,500 Americans killed and more than 30,000 injured, Obama spoke of the heavy sacrifice and hard work in the Iraq mission. Obama also paid tribute to the military families back home, noting their struggles to make ends meet during the years of the Iraqi campaign. Obama also included that nothing could stop/persuade him from making this decision, it is final.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Joins Fight Against Slavery[/b][/color]\nGoogle Inc. announced Wednesday that it's providing $11.5 million in grants to 10 organizations working to end modern-day slavery and human trafficking. According to estimates by grant recipients, Google's support will free an estimated 12,000 people from slavery and prevent millions more from being victimized. Numbers vary widely, but policymakers, activists and scholars estimate the number of modern-day slaves at somewhere between 10 million and 30 million people worldwide.\n\n[color=white][b]Belgian Grenade Attack Casts Somber Shadow[/b][/color]\nFlowers, teddy bears and candles mark the spot Wednesday where a gunman tossed grenades into a crowded Liege market square a day before, claiming several lives and wounding scores more. Workers at the Christmas market opened up their stalls, housed in wooden cabins, but trade was slow. One woman said they had been told they could start trading later, if they wanted first to pay tribute to the five people killed and 130 wounded before the attacker, Liege resident Nourdine Amrani, apparently took his own life.\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://goo.gl/Y5qY4[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/IjV9j.png[/img][/align]",

Before we start, I'd like to thank you for allowing me to interview you!\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: Thank you for interviewing me Michael!\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: To start off, do you have any special members that deserve a shoutout?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: I would like to give a shoutout to Phismatic, Poliice, and EyeOfTheTiger.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: Great! To start us off, why don't you explain how you got your username.\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: Well I got if from my gamertag AN ANGRY K0ALA, which I made because I thought it looked funny when I killed someone back in Halo 3.  I then started using it everywhere. I first registered as AnAngryKoala then changed my name to Koala. Even though I'm no longer Angry, you should never piss off a Koala.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: That's good advice - I know from experience. How have you seen Hack Forums evolve since you registered? What notable changes have you observed, and what's your opinion on them?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: I've noticed how large of community HF is becoming. It's hard to believe that there have been over 15,000,000 posts since Hack Forums began.  Being an avid gamer, one of the biggest changes I've seen is the introduction of the Griefing Subforum of the Minecraft section. I see countless new members flock to that section in hopes of coding their own client or starting the next big griefing team.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: That section has gotten huge, though it's quality is heavily debated. What other sections do you find yourself drawn too?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: After building a custom gaming computer, I find myself browsing the Computer Overclocking, Customizing and Hardware section. I love seeing what builds people come up with, providing feedback, and thinking about my next big build.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: I know you helped me with my build a ton - I can vouch that you're a helpful member. Is your love of assisting people what drove you to join the Red Lions?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: Yes it is, I love helping members make important decisions. In the Red Lions, I'm surrounded by helpful members that go out of their way to assist someone. As a member of the Red Lions, I help anyone to the fullest extent of my abilities.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: It's great to see the Red Lions around assisting everyone - We're glad to have you. How did you originally find Hack Forums?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: I was introduced to Hack Forums by Phismatic. He's a good friend of mine that has taught me most of the things I know.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: I think he introduced both of us - What are some of the activities you like to do when you're not on Hack Forums?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: I love watching Youtube and gaming, I play BF3 and Minecraft on the PC. Halo, BF3, and COD on Xbox.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: I know we share a lot in common - What's your favorite part of Hack Forums? Why have you stayed?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: My favorite part about Hack forums would have to be the members. New members come and go, but the ones that stay around are worth getting to know. I've stuck around so I can meet more of these members and learn from from them.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: Do you see any change in the quality of incoming members, or is it relatively consistent with past months?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: I would say it stays pretty consistent, depending on what they are looking for when they join. I've noticed new members interested in programming and more advanced methods tend to be more civilized. The lower quality members are the ones joining to learn to hack facebook, have something hacked for them, or the ones that join hoping that someone will hold their hand and show them how to do everything.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: I agree completely - That's it for my end, do you have anything you'd like to say to the members of HF?\r\n[b][color=#1466ff]Koala[/color][/b]: I would like to wish everyone Happy Holidays! And I would like to thank you Michael for interviewing me for HF News.\r\n\n[b][color=#1466ff]Michael Westen[/color][/b]: Thanks Koala! Happy Holidays to all, and too all, a good night![/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - Vitani's Mate[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: Hello Vitani’s Mate and thank you for accepting this interview. Now to start this interview off, would you like to make any shout outs?\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]: Hmm shout outs, Oh man i have too many shout outs. And thanks for this offer. \r\n\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: Thats fine. What brought you to HackForums in the first place? Did anyone introduce you or did you have another motive for joining the site?\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]: No not really, I was looking on google to find some MSN hacks and facebook hacks and i pretty much grew up in the HF family, Not really a big motive. \r\n\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: You have a lot of posts, how are you so active through the forum?\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]: I really don't know, I mean i love to help people out with their problems, Well try to help them out as the best as i can. I go on HF every day to see what is going on first and then i post. \r\n\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: Who has had the most influence on you during your time on HF and why?\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]: Oh, Well i don't really know, There is alot of people in my mind. I am pretty sure they are all equal and helped me out at same length of time. \r\n\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: In regards to your Username, who is “Vitanni”\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]: I get this question asked alot of times while i am here. Vitani is a lioness from The Lion King 2, She is Zira's daughter and happens to be my fave charcter in The Lion King series. \r\n\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: What is your opinion on HF currently, and what changes would you like to see in the future?\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]: Well, HF is awesome, I think i love it. Don't really need to change anything about HF but Omni needs to put in the Vouch System, I can say it is WELL over due. With the vouch system in place, Scammers will be no more but everything else i wouldn't really change anything. \r\n\n[color=#0066ff]+Pirate[/color]: Well thank you so much Vitani’s Mate for accepting to be interviewed and is there anything else that you would like to say?\r\n[color=#0066ff]Vitani’s Mate[/color]:Thank you very much for having me.

You are really sexually turned on and you're going to stay this way for months! (Of course there's more to life than sex. There's lawn bowling.) Since this focus of Mars is really a manifestation of energy in a certain part of your chart, do be careful because this same sexy energy can also manifest as disputes about shared property, inheritances, taxes, debt or anything you own jointly with others. You will also want to transform relationships - and partners - for the better. Tread carefully here. Mars is hitting their chart somewhere, too![/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Pisces:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nMars opposite your sign for months can definitely produce tension with others, especially partners and close friends. (Gulp.) Be aware of this and do whatever you can to avoid conflicts because this strife will only make everyone miserable, including you. The upside is that this does give you the courage to put your cards on the table and express your grievances. But don't overdo it. Do not make a mountain out of a mole hill. Far better to be open to compromise, warm hugs and soft words. Or why not play bureaucracy? Everyone stands in a circle and the first one to do anything loses.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Aries:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nIt's not easy to be a team player right now. You feel competitive, independent and you want credit for whatever you do. You're certainly no slacker! You'll give 110 per cent to everything now and for months to come. You have lots of energy to work but - \"I'll do it My Waay.\" Ideally, you should find a way to work for yourself. And if you can't do that, then find a way to make your success the success of others. This same gung-ho energy applies to your desire to improve your health. You're very keen to do this! Start by swivelling your wrist every time you hold a drinking glass. Two to the left, two to the right. (Now look at all those bubbles!)[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Taurus:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nThe part of your chart that is energized by Mars controls love affairs and romance. Yahoo! This is why you want to play the leading role in your own movie. Certainly, Mars will boost your sex drive, no question. But it will also energize your desire for self-expression in any form. Therefore, look for ways to express your creativity: drawing, dancing, singing, writing or whatever you like. You'll also enjoy sports and playful activities with children. In addition, show business, the entertainment world, and the hospitality industry will please you! Give yourself many chances to do these things. Now for the warning: Guard against fighting in sports. Be patient with your kids. Easy does it.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Gemini:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nAll this pumped energy of Mars is happening at home and within your family sphere. Its negative expression will be domestic strife and conflict. You'll be fighting with family members. (You know who you are.) Take a deep breath. Back off and create some space between you and others. Enough with this negative expression of energy because it only makes you (and everyone else) miserable. Its positive expression would be to use this energy in a constructive way by improving where you live. You might tackle renovations or do major cleanups or something like that. Since this energy is at your disposal, why not make the best use of it? Wouldn't that be smart and to your advantage?[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Cancer:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nNow and for months to come, your communications with others will be highly energized! You'll be bold and straightforward. You'll say what you mean and mean what you say. You'll be clear with others and state your intentions. This will definitely help you write, teach, act, sell, market or persuade people. The downside is obvious. Since you're so assertive, you could get in trouble, especially with siblings, relatives and neighbours. They might not be impressed with your new style! (Of course, you can't go back to the way you were when you were younger - you were shorter then and you weighed less.) Be happy with the new you.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Leo:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nYou're becoming obsessed with money. You're checking accounts and visiting your Treasure Room daily to count your gold. You're wondering how to earn more money, and make your money last into the future. How can you can feel secure about your finances so you can live happily forever after? And hey, we haven't even got to the part about how you want to spend your money! And while this is going on, you're also looking around you and beginning to appreciate your home and your belongings and everything you have. How curious! And at a deeper level, you wonder about life. What really matters? How should you best use the time left to you?[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Virgo:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nLook out world! For the first time in your life, fiery Mars is in your sign for months. You are so pumped! Not only will you be energized, it's almost as if the energy goes beyond you and energizes your whole life! Everything around you is busier! You've got things to do, places to go, people to see. It's fine with you as long as you're free to do what you want. (Aye, there's the rub.) This means people should not boss you around! Well, dream on. This is the real world. Sit up and be a person. Use this physical energy to do work that is meaningful. But resist the Diva thang. This energy can be very positive in your life or it could create problems with others. Your choice.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Libra:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nThis is a most curious time for you and will continue to be this way for months ahead because deep unconscious urges and ideas are bubbling to the surface now. This stuff surprises even you! Past behaviour patterns, old fears and insecurities and worries might haunt you. (What's with this?) Literally, your unconscious thoughts are surfacing! Now, here is the eye-opener: Why are these thoughts and urges hidden in your subconscious? It must be that you're denying their existence and their validity. In turn, this means you have to face aspects about yourself you would rather deny. But hey, we all do this. We all have these aspects. (I've been keeping mine in a shoebox under my bed for years.)[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Scorpio:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nYou are going to have to use every ounce of diplomacy and charm to maintain good relationships with friends and acquaintances in group situations. (I am sure you know whereof I speak.) It's so easy to lose it with others right now. Basically, you might feel resentful. And this resentment will find a way of slipping out the side of your mouth. Not good for public relations. Instead, use this increased energy for physical activity with others. Sports and athletics will be fun! (And competitive!) You can also work with others and accomplish an enormous amount. Until next summer, this is the perfect time for you to formulate long-term goals and figure out how to pursue them. (If your bread is stale, make toast.)[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Sagittarius:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nIn many ways, you're sitting pretty because for months ahead, fiery Mars will ignite and arouse your ambition as never before. It will be like a rocket going after what you want. Naturally, this can be used to your advantage! You're willing to work hard to promote your good name and reputation. However, independence is the keyword. You want to work on your own and you want to do your own thing. This could threaten bosses, parents and employers. (Ya think?) It might also get you in trouble with co-workers. Think of it as energy at your disposal. Use it to get things done, but don't be too competitive with others. And always tell the truth unless you're an exceedingly good liar.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=xx-large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Capricorn:[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\r\nIt's a given that in the next seven-to-eight months you're going to want to travel more than ever before in your life. So why not book a trip somewhere? It's called going with the flow. You will love a change of scenery! You're eager for adventure and hungry to learn something new, especially about other cultures and foreign countries. Others are just as eager to explore opportunities in publishing, the media, higher education and anything to do with medicine or the law. It's wonderful that thrilling opportunities await you in these areas because you now have the guts to pursue them! Just don't get sidetracked in conflicts about politics, religion or racial issues. Save your breath.[/spoiler]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i1214.photobucket.com/albums/cc499/HFGenuine/news.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/WpABi]0OTF[/url]\r\n[list][*]Headlines\r\n[/list][/list]\r\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\r\n[list][*]User News\r\n[*]Opinions\r\n[/list][/list]\r\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/jZvPh]TheHackersLove[/url]\r\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list][/list]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/Et7FB]Michael Westen[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/JJuWm]Daniel Faraday[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[*][color=white][b]Web Show Co-Host[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/gGUxd]Astonish is NJ[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editor[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/WtTLD]Tasemu[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/89giM]Ignite.[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[/list]",
