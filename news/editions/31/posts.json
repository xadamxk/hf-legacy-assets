This is just one of the many projects we do to help HackForums. Although one of our helpers are not from Red Lions the user \"Zeon\" helped us out. \r\n\nHope you enjoy this week's HF Edition![/align]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/8496/headlinesr.png[/img][/align]\r\n\nThe Ex-Admin [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][b][color=#4DD0FC]Hanzo[/color][/b][/url], has returned as an Admin. Veterans of HF know whom [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][b][color=#4DD0FC]Hanzo[/color][/b][/url] is, but for new joiners, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][b][color=#4DD0FC]Hanzo[/color][/b][/url] is a real life friend of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url], and was an admin a few years ago. Upon his return, it appears many veterans of HF believe Hackforums.net will change for the better. Time will tell, either way, welcome back [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][b][color=#4DD0FC]Hanzo[/color][/b][/url] Keep in mind everyone [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][b][color=#4DD0FC]Hanzo[/color][/b][/url] is in charge of Rep Abuse, so be sure to PM Hanzo regarding reputation abuse and not [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2103][b][color=#4DD0FC]Crow[/color][/b][/url] or [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url].\r\n\nStaff section, Junk section, and all private groups threads were visible to everyone on HackForums. To the people who were on for those lucky 20 minutes, got the chance to view staff section and what they \"Gossip\" about. As [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2103][b][color=#4DD0FC]Crow[/color][/b][/url] states, the event that happend is like \"[color=#FFD700]Santa leaving his bag at somebody's  house[/color]\" As for staff and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url], they have felt upset that the section was viewable to everyone.

If it was not for the great success [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] has done to this site, we would not have been able to come this far. \r\n\nThe new Official HackForums Group, The [b][color=#FF0000]Red Lions[/color][/b], has seen its first accepted applications in the past week. Currently, we have maxed out on the wanted number of members for the new High Quality group. Here are the words of Red Lions leader [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=229706][b]Tєchnology[/b][/url] on the matter.\r\n\n[QUOTE='Tєchnology' pid='9188673' dateline='1295476964']\r\nRecruitment is still open , we maxed out on members ..\r\nso every week inactive members will get kicked and new applicants will be given a chance....so you can apply via user cp , including link to your app.[/QUOTE]\r\n\nThe recruitment thread is still open and you can locate it [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=965097][b]here[/b][/url].\r\nSo, if you are still itching to join the new group, just wait, you may get accepted in the coming weeks!\r\n\nHackForums.net owner, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url], has set up an Official FaceBook Page for those who wish to connect with HackForums on Facebook.

He seemed to be really scared so his first response was to make a thread in the lounge asking what would happen.[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=987813]Click here to read more[/url]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Binahu [/color][/b] has opened a scam report againt [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=492684][b][color=#1E90FF]WIZCRAFT[/color][/b][/url], the maintainer and seller of Maniac Booter.

The topic was raised by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121792][b][color=#1E90FF]Dr.HoboZombie[/color][/b][/url], and had replies from members, staff and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#4DD0FC]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] himself.

As of yet, he hasn't shed light on to this exploit, as he's hoping to get praise from Youtube/Google to be put towards his College application.
