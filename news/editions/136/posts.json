Nothing is there forever, nothing is set in stone. So when the HF News team received information on DMCA and Copyright infringement notices, there was a time of surprise, but then a realization and acceptance of our passing. Another forum has laid claim to the idea that they own the news system that Hack Forums currently utilizes. Seeing as it's not in the team's best interests to try to fight these allegations any longer, we've fallen to an end. At this point, we just need to pass under the waves and die with love, rather than tear ourselves apart. Goodnight, sweet prince.\r\n\n[color=white][b]New Marketplace Sponsored Products and Services[/b][/color]\r\nQuite a remarkable update to do with the Marketplace has been put into place this week. Users now have the option to buy their own subforum within the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=264][b]Sponsored Products and Services[/b][/url]. The current fee of having your own sub-forum is at a price of $300 USD, but we expect this to change as [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] won't want to saturate the idea. By the looks of it, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] implemented this after implementing the one sticky per user rule; this way if people want more then one sticky, they can use this forum and have up to five stickies in their own sub-forum. You may read the full thread [url=http://bit.ly/YQQe0b]here[/url] where you may see the current price, rules, and more information about this.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Happy Easter from the Writ3rs Team[/b][/color]\r\nEaster has come around so quickly! It seems like it was just the other day that we celebrated our last Easter; time sure does go fast, especially with spending a lot of time on Hack Forums. The Hack Forums Writ3rs Team would like to wish everyone a Happy Easter. Many of you would have most likely noticed the Easter banner located at the top of Hack Forums. We hope you enjoy your Easter eggs. Don't eat too much! :)\r\n\n[color=white][b]Griefing Low Quality Posting Forum Crackdown[/b][/color]\r\nSite Owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has announced a low quality posting crack down, otherwise known as LQP crack down, in the Minecraft's griefing sub-forum located here: [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=203][b]Griefing[/b][/url]. Through the years on Hack Forums, the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=203][b]Griefing[/b][/url] subforum has been a pretty low tier of quality. We're glad to say [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has finally taken action.\r\n\n[color=white][b]CPA / PPD Make Money Sub-forum Added [/b][/color]\r\nThis week a new section, [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=268][b]CPA / PPD Make Money[/b][/url], has been added.

Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts? (Sorry, I couldn't think of a clever pun with your name :P)\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Hey Carrot, glad you decided to finally interview me! I'd like to give shoutouts to Anal OG, Paradoxum, Sir, and literally everyone else in The Alliance (that's including you, of course) ^_^ \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awwh, aren't you a little cutie? 😊 How are you doing today, bud? \r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Aw, you're too kind. I'm blushing! :3\r\nI've been doing fine today. Listening to some anime music on Tasemu's AA radio site (Raadio.me). It's awesome by the way, so check it out if you haven't yet. They even have an Android app out. I'm also playing some League of Legends. \r\nWhat about you? \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome!\r\nI'm not too bad myself, thanks. Little tired, but can't complain 😝\r\nAnyways, onwards with the interview. So the first thing I usually like to as is: What was it that brought you to Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, my memory is quite blurred, but I'll give it a go.\r\n\nUnlike many others, I wasn't much of a gamer. I didn't come here with the intention to h4x and boot people from Xbox or sell my tags and whatnot. \r\nI was apart of a small development team for a private server of a game (the name of the game I won't mention here for security purposes, but it's pretty big). Despite the age group for the game itself, there were also a few other groups that developed private servers for this game as well. You would be surprised at how skilled in programming these people were (around the ages of 13-15). They were pretty good coders, well versed in C++, C, PHP, Python, Visual Basic, Action Script 2 & 3. Anyways as you can see, we had a lot of competition on our hands. Despite this, I decided to recruit two close friends of mine at the time, and we started to develop a private server of our own. \r\nAfter months upon months of headaches, we finally launched. At first our memberbase was small, but as time went on, we became one of the largest with thousands of users (I can't remember the exact number but it was pretty big for a game such as this).\r\nWe were then eventually put on radars and were under fire.  My friends wanted to retaliate, but I had no idea how. One of my friends started his own botnet and my other friend had the idea of RATing the opposing staff members of the other servers. She then started to talk about crypters and introduced me to a site. The name Hack Forums was thrown around and I asked them what that was, which was how I stumbled here. \r\n\nI was quite the lurker for the first few months as the community was quite intimidating at first. The activity was too much for me to handle, especially in The Lounge and Hacking sections, so I decided to stay in the Graphics section for a while. My friend then started to urge me to post more, so I started to post in the Hacking section. I learned a few basic things, such as how basic SQLi and XSS works, and also how to RAT and start a botnet. I didn't dive too deep in the hacking scene though. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Do you think the primary focus of your time here has changed since you first joined?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. When I first joined, I barely contributed at all. I posted a bit in the Hacking sections, The Lounge and Graphics sections from time to time, but that was it. Now my primary focuses are to help out site-wise by replying to threads located in Rules, Announcements, News and Feedback, to do my [i]volunteered[/i] jobs -to the best of my abilities- on the HF News team, in The Alliance and of course the White Hat Help section. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] And do you think, in doing that, it's helped you out in terms of real life? I mean, posting on forums can boost social activity and literary skills especially. And not to mention the stuff you learn. \r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Most definitely. My writing skills has hugely improved since the time I came here. I'm an extremely slow reader when it comes to books, so one may think that my writing might not be the best in comparison with other students. Wrong. Since I read so much online, I have a huge advantage over other people. I get to experience other ways of writing by looking at how people around the world post, and in turn I learn from their vocabulary and sentence structures as well. \r\nThis has greatly contributed to how I currently write. I rarely ever get writer's block and essays are no longer a problem for me. \r\n\nI've also learned a bit from the Graphics section which has helped me at school since I take a graphics design course there. \r\n\nAs for the White Hat Help section, I don't think I've learned much from that section alone. My base knowledge usually comes from experience of course, but also from the time when I used to lurk in the HJT forum back when it was open for everyone. I took advantage of that and basically read over every thread they had in there 😝\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] It's really cool to see such a \"niche\" site like Hack Forums expanding to other fields that its members are interested in. \r\nBOXXY JUST MADE A NEW VIDEO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER, HUH?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Yes it is, which is why I enjoy Hack Forums so much. \r\nI've yet to watch a Boxxy video, although I heard that she's quite the character around the interwebs. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] You're a noob. She's awesome and I love her ♥ \r\nPfft, what youtubers [i]do[/i] you like?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly, I'm not much of a YouTuber like I was back in 2010. Now I usually just use it to listen to music, especially covers from Kurt Schneider, Alex Goot and Jason Chen 👹\r\nI also enjoy the occasional videos from Nigahiga and Kevjumba. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] What new-coming technology interests you the most, in terms of video streaming? And what do you see for the future of YouTube? \r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] Err, I've been out of the scene for so long that I really don't know how to comment on that. \r\n\nBeing a YouTuber since 2008 (and one who could have been a Partner at the age of 13), I really don't like how it's going. Well maybe there are bits of upsides with Google purchasing the company, but many downsides are bundled up with that. For example, take a look at that channel layout! They've destroyed what I once held dear to my heart. There are just so much crap they've added that I find unnecessary. All in all I don't like the direction YouTube is heading, at least from what I can see. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Haha, well, with Google, you never know. \r\nAny last words before we conclude the interview? ^.^\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021][color=white][b]Retribute:[/b][/color][/url] True, true. You never know as Google with its magic is quite unpredictable. \r\nWell this interview was certainly shorter than I expected it to be! \r\nI would just like to wish a Happy Easter to everyone, and I hope you're enjoying your new position, Carrot :) \r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319]iNuke[/url][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler=]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to your HF News interview, iNuke! Do you have any shout outs?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] Hello and thank you for interviewing me. Well yes, shout out to ALL my Infamous brothers <3 and to all my French brothers that are on HackForums. Also, shout out to Shekhar, Stay Plural, ~Wix, Daisy, SE✘Y, and Connected the best canadian ever. Sorry to those that I forgot, I love you. <3\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]Thanks for the shoutout 😝! Moving on, how, when and why did you join HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] I'm from a French hacking forum. Some people were speaking about \"HF\", so I did some searches and I found HackForums. I was very happy and excited. At this time, I wanted to know how to code, how to hack, how to make money, etc. But then I realized that I couldn't do it all because life is short. That was back in April 2012 and my english was terrible. After I got better at english, I left the French forum. Now I'm only on HackForums and maybe on 2 or 3 others that aren't hacking/coding/etc related.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url]Since you're from France, why don't you drop a little message to the french HF members?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] Dédicace à vous les français. On représente la France sur HackForums. Restez actifs mes soces 🙂\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Have you learned anything since you've joined HF? Or have you learned most of what you know on other forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] I learned a lot of things. First, as I said earlier, I realized that I can't do all that I want to do because life is short. I learned a few things about hacking: everything related to ratting and I read some tutorials about website hacking (pentesting). But to be honest, I'm a little bit lazy and I don't find the time to learn more. I also learned how to e-whore and I earned some money with it. But I can't wait to learn more, more and even more. I just need some holidays to start, because I'm really busy with school and homework. I also know that HackForums is a place with a lot of friendly and helpful members, but also with some annoying members too.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] As someone who is in a couple HF groups, I know that the forum experience is entirely different than when you're not in a group. What do you think about that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] I think that this is true, because when you're in a group, you can meet new members that are already in this group. To be honest, I love groups when there is a sensation of family, like we're all the same family, we respect us each other, etc. So yes, be in a group can change the forum experience, but only if members of this group are kind, nice and friendly. 🙂\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I see you are runnning some french lessons on HF? What inspired you to start that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] I was sure that you'll ask me that question. Well, I see a lot of threads about PPD/CPA in the bragging rights section that are saying that FR got the best offers, with a lot of $ to win, etc. I also see some threads about people who want to learn languages. This two kind of threads inspired me. The second thing that inspired me was that I love to share my knowledge and I love to help the community. So I thought it would be great to do organized French lessons, with my voice, some exercises, and everything. After thinking a long time about it, I finally wrote the two first ones. I'll work on the third lesson really soon. So, to be clear, helping the community and sharing my knowledge inspired me so much to do that.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] How did you come up with the name iNuke which you use here on HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] Wow... It has been a long time ago since I've invented that username. Nuke for the Nuke of Modern Warfare 2, and \"i\" for the style 😎\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you make money online or offline? If offline, what is your job? If online, I don't require you to share your secrets 😝.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1278319][color=white][b]iNuke:[/b][/color][/url] I don't have an offline job; no time for that. Sometimes I help my neighboor to sell things in my High School, that's all. About online, I'm not making money regulary, like each month or whatever because first, I don't know a real working and reliable method and second, I need time that I haven't got. I may start and I have started a little bit PPD/CPA but I can't do a lot since I need time to find ideas, setting up everything, etc. And also, I'm a retired e-whorer, so yes I won money with that, but I stopped within 3 or 4 months. But I may start again soon, since I read a nice method. Also, I earn a few $ with my YouTube Service or Instagram followers, etc but not that much. But I'm satisfied, it's just extra money. And I lost a lot of money investing in ebooks when I was new to HF (now I know that ebooks are most of all bullshit; most of all) and investing in an original name on Instagram that someone jacked.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any hobbies IRL?

They then proceeded to sell and give away some of these diamonds, putting tons of diamonds into the economy. Many members were blamed for duplicating the diamonds, particularly a poor fellow by the name of Oliver; he was blamed for duping because he sold diamonds and scammed others, although members are unsure whether he was the duplicator or not. One thing is for sure; diamonds are now much more abundant on Planet Beacon, and it's been said that there are now over ten members with five stacks of diamond blocks each, not to mention the duplicators and scammers who have been involved!\n\n[b][color=white]Minin- a Minecraft rap by [/color][/b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=406243]Wifi[/url][color=white][b] and[/b] [/color][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=181208]Darkwin[/url]\nWifi and Darkwin of Wifi Gang have dropped their picks and picked up the beat in their latest rap, titled Minin.

Ouya's developers have announced that the console will launch on June 4 in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. \"Nine months ago, we shared an idea for an immersive, beautiful, and powerful game console that generated an outpouring of support from game developers, gamers, technology enthusiasts, and more,\" Ouya CEO Julie Uhrman said in a statement.

Sources say that sales will increase even further when the disc-based version hits stores on April 30 in the United States. Australia, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan will see the disc launch sometime in June.\n\n[color=white][b]Free Halo 4 & GoW: Judgement DLC Hits the Xbox LIVE Marketplace[/b][/color]\nWhat, free DLC?

The accident occurred when a bus and a car collided into each other. According to the emergency response services there was an estimated 27 passengers on the bus at the time of the crash. Authorities says they have evidence that the driver of the car drove into the bus, but later fled the scene. Mexico's roads have had their fair share of car accidents. Just last April, a total of 43 people were killed due to an accident involving a cargo truck.\n\n[color=white][b]Sudanese Rebels Release Hostages[/b][/color]\nAccording to the International Committee for the Red Cross, Sudanese rebels captured 31 Darfuris on their way to a conference a week ago. The militant kidnappers were armed, and they had taken the Darfuris to an undisclosed location. The kidnapped people were handed over to the Red Cross by the Sudan Liberation Army. In related news, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan has been charged with war crimes and genocide by the International Criminal Court. However, the Sudanese government does not officially recognize the court, and they claim the courts have personal vendettas against their government officials.\n\n[color=white][b]Man Puts Acid in a Person's Shoes[/b][/color]\nA woman has reported to have lost the tips of her toes due to one of her co-workers sticking acid inside her shoes. Specifically, authorities say the man snuck hydrofluoric acid inside of her sneakers. 40 year old Tatsujiro Fukazawa, the man suspected of the crime, is said to have also had more-than-friendly feelings for the assaulted co-worker. However, the suspect declined the allegations. Police officials have yet to give any more information after arresting him on Thursday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state, \"Fingertip injuries from hydrogen fluoride may result in persistent pain, bone loss, and injury to the nail bed.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/53a15Bz.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nAlong with the recent Apple passcode vulnerability, Apple has been faced with another security issue regarding iMessage. Several well known iOS Developers have been receiving several thousand iMessages in just minutes, resulting in the Messages.app of the user's iDevice to crash. Similar to a prior bug in iOS 3 regarding an SMS vulnerability, this DDOS attack method has yet to been patched by Apple. Apple has yet to say a word regarding the matter.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nThe Apple and Android App Store have both gotten millions of downloads in recent years, but Microsoft is catching up. Since the release of Windows 8, the Windows Store has gotten more than 100 million downloads for mobile applications, bringing the gross total to exceed one billion downloads. Microsoft has been planning to use the new Windows OS and take advantage of its capabilities to make mobile applications greater for users. Microsoft has announced that the next developer conference will be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco from June 26-28. Registration for the event starts this Tuesday, April 2nd.\n\n[color=white][b]Samsung[/b][/color]\nThe talk of Android and Samsung lately has been all about the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the changes it will bring to mobile devices.

In the United States, pre-orders for AT&T will be available on April 16th.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/zHqnaJS.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Phil Ramone Passes Away[/color][/b]\nProducer Phil Ramone has passed away on Saturday after being admitted to a hospital on Manhattan earlier that day for a brain aneurysm. Born on January 5th in 1934, he lived a successful life of just over 79 years. Some of his most famous production credits include Barbra Streisand's \"A Star Is Born\", many Billy Joel albums, Paul Simon's \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\" and \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" and Paul McCartney's \"Press To Play\" and \"Flowers In The Dirt\" along with albums for Frank Sinatra, Chicago, Natalie Cole, Tony Bennet, Neil Diamond, Julio Iglesias, Elton John, Michael Bolton, Liza Minelli, James Taylor, and Van Morrison. Phil Ramone was very musical even at a young age; he could play the violin at the age of three and performed to Queen Elizabeth II when he was just 10. During his career he earned ten Grammy Awards; his first for his role in the production of \"Just The Way You Are\". Matt, Phil's son, commented that Phil was \"very loving and will be missed\" when he first heard about the incident. Billy Joel who was a close friend of Phil, said in a statement: \"I always thought of Phil Ramone as the most talented guy in my band. So much of my music was shaped by him and brought to fruition by him. I have lost a dear friend \"and my greatest mentor.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Wilko Johnson Not Well Enough to Complete His Final Tour[/b][/color]\nSinger Wilko Johnson has been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and has not attempted to find any form of treatment for the disease. This means that unfortunately he has already played his final show. Johnson began his last tour, aimed to bid farewell to his fans, but he was forced to cancel the final two shows on the tour in his hometown, Canvey Island. It has been reported that he may have been victim to another illness while performing with Madness in the cold last Saturday night. His management posted the following statement on Sunday: Important Announcement: Due to health reasons, tonight and tomorrow night's Canvey Island concerts have been cancelled. An official announcement from management will follow shortly. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience for those fans that have already made their way down to tonight's concert. Wilko, after the performance, said, \"I only performed one song but it was freezing and the wing was blowing up an absolute gale. It was whipping into my face and how Madness performed for an hour I have no idea. It was very, very, very cold and I think this is why I feel down. It is really upsetting not to perform for the people of Canvey at the end. I really wish I could have done it and if one little bit of me thought it was possible I would have done it.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Madonna Couldn't Give a \"s**t\" if Brother is Dead or Alive[/b][/color]\nAnthony Ciccone, Maddona's homeless, forgotten brother claims that his sister does not care whether he is alive or dead. Madonna, the 54-year-old, has recently been labelled as the best selling female pop artist of all time. Meanwhile, her net worth has reportedly reached a stunning $1 billion. Madonna was born in the state of Michigan and is the third oldest child of her five other siblings. Anthony has been known as Madonna's alcoholic brother, and has been living on the streets of Michigan for the past three years. \"Madonna doesn't give a s**t if I'm dead or alive. She lives in her own world,\" Anthony said to the Daily Mail Online. \"I never loved her in the first place, she never loved me. We never loved each other. My father would be very happy if I died of hypothermia and then he would not have to worry about it anymore. He's old school, he grew up in the Depression. He doesn't want to be bothered, he's lived his life you see. He doesn't like me. He doesn't want me to be me, he wants me to be somebody else. He thinks the way I live is intentional. He simply doesn't know me.\" Anthony continues to plead for support from his family. \"I'm a human being, you can call me what you want. The term Alcoholic is used as a label, I don't like it. I don't need brain surgery, I merely need love and care of family and friends.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIz9ZCHKFFY[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/DY4X2FS.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI'd like to apologize for the time it has taken to pull this last edition together, but I felt it was important to get everyone's opinion on the last edition.\n\nIf you look at the posts below, you'll see a goodbye message from almost every member on the team.

Splitting it into categories, makes it a lot easier to figure what \nis what, which really counts in this case, since I as an example only find my interest \nin the Innuendo section.

This new forum forum is great, and it will help a lot of \nusers and it will avoid trolling, flaming and wannabe mini mods.
