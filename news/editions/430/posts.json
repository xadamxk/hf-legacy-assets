It enables you to mark other members as \"Blacklisted.\" This feature allows you to block members from visiting any thread that is made by you or contains posts from you. Currently, this feature is restricted to [b][color=#FFF]Writ3rs[/color][/b] and [b][color=#FFF]Mentor[/color][/b] members only.\n\n[b][color=white]An0n Applications[/color][/b]\nMembers who want to apply for the newly-added [b][color=#000]An0n[/color][/b] group, now have to go through an application process. Once you've applied, [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#9999FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] will Approve/Deny your application on the basis of your paranoia level, alias history and rebelious traits. The group is designed for users who want the utmost privacy on the web. The main perk is the new anonymous theme with no avatars, signatures, logo and monochrome dark theme. In addition, members of An0n will get access to no-log VPN service and a private subforum that ignores ALL site rules including warez rules. Cost starts at $1,000 and increases by $100 for each member added.\n\n[b][color=white]Staff Deleted[/color][/b]\nAfter considering a lot about HF groups, [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#9999FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] eventually deleted [b][color=#AFAAAA]r00t[/color][/b] and [b]3p1c[/b] user groups. After extra thoughts, [b][color=#99CCFF]Staff[/color][/b] was also deleted and all staff were moved into Mentors. Recently, a staff member was bribed $50 to delete a thread and another staff member was given access to a botnet in exchange to edit a competitor's marketplace thread. [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#9999FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] determined [b][color=#99CCFF]Staff[/color][/b] have too much power on Hack Forums. \n\n[b][color=white]Ub3r Upgrade Available[/color][/b]\nAfter a recent change with the user groups, HF Ub3r is back again. Now you can purchase HF Ub3r as a 3-month upgrade subscription. Those who were in the Ub3r user group were given a 6-month subscription period. [url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#9999FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] stated that he plans to introduce a 6-month and 1-year subscription plan in the near future. Price for 3-month is currently set at $30. PayPal and Tron (TRX) are the only two accepted payment methods.\n\n[b][color=white]Free Vend0r Upgrade for 3p1c+l33t[/color][/b]\nThose who were holding [b]3p1c[/b] and [b][color=#ffcc00]L33t[/color][/b] both will get free [b][color=#2D7E52]Vend0r[/color][/b] upgrade permanently. Those who were [b]3p1c[/b] only will be moved to [b][color=#ffcc00]L33t[/color][/b] user group. This is to balance out the power trip [b][color=#0066FF]Ub3r[/color][/b] members have been riding on for the past years. [b][color=#ffcc00]L33t[/color][/b] who were [b]3pic[/b] now can talk shit to [b][color=#0066FF]Ub3r[/color][/b] members just as much.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/memo.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Writ3rs Evacuated[/color][/b]\nEveryone in Writ3rs HF News Team was kicked and we'll be recruiting fresh new roles. For now, we'll only have Headlines until I can find new journalists for each section.\n[/font][/size]",
