The group held recruitments few and far in between and getting accepted usually took an incredible amount of time and dedication. Near the end of 2013, most Alliance members were removed from the group as changes were made, eventually leading to the creation of the Null usergroup. The Alliance is gone, now only a memory, it is the end of an era. While most new groups launch with much criticism surrounding them, Null seems to have gotten the opposite. Focusing on security, it is certain to attract many members from several different areas in the computing sector of the IT world. Led by T3h Hacker, Vinnie, and Soccer, the group is sure to make an impact in the near future. A discussion was created for members to speak their minds about the change, and can be read [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4025378][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Late Night Thoughts[/b][/color]\nHack Forums' owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted several of his thoughts surrounding the forum on the evening of January 29th. Within the thread, he notes a few problems he sees with the current standing of the website. These problems include topics such as having too many rules, a cumbersome sticky process, the broken reputation system, the lack of two factor authentication for account security, and the need for a better integration of Bitcoin. The thread was not intended to be used as a discussion and was therefore immediately locked. It can be considered as a note to himself, and states that he just needs to get the issues dealt with. Private discussions on the topics have resulted in the conclusion that these changes would prove to be extremely beneficial to the forum, especially the introduction of a working two factor authentication system in order to secure user accounts against infiltration and malicious use. The note to himself can be read [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4030042][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Arise, Oh Ye New Staff![/b][/color]\nGive the ex-mentor [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=956054][color=#9999FF][b]Emylbus[/b][/color][/url] a loud round of applause, and congratulate him on becoming the newest staff member of the Hack Forums community. Only a few months after being promoted to Mentor, it seems his tremendous dedication toward the site with contributions such as diligent activity and the constant updates of the Hack Forums Enhancement Suite has caused [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] to grant him the opportunity to give being staff a try. As usual, all new staff members go though a probational period before becoming a full staff member. The community seems to have greeted the new change with a positive attitude, as he is well known throughout the forum and recently received the revered [url=http://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=4][b]Member of the Month[/b][/url] award.

What's the good word? Do you have any shootouts you'd like to make before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Sure, shoutout to my wife who's currently 8 months pregnant. The baby is due this month, mid February. We're both very excited. Also to my homie, Clique. You gon' make them eggs cheesy with them grits or nah?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Congrats! Is it a boy or a girl? Do you have any names in mind? - If you're uncomfortable sharing this information I understand and we'll move on.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] We're keeping it a surprise, which is part of the fun. As for names, we're really leaning towards Link (from Zelda) or Anakin (from Star Wars). It's currently up in the air.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Really? That's interesting. Clark is a great name too. You must be excited about becoming a father. How are you feeling about it right now? Are you nervous?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Not really nervous, but anxious. This lil' creature has been living inside my wife's stomach for about 180 days now and I want to see who it is that's been responsible for the abrupt mood swings.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahahaha, I bet you'll be happy when that's over. Who knows, maybe one day you're baby boy/girl will be a member of HF! We already know he/she will be more mature and probably more intelligent than eiqht at any age. So how long have you been involved with The HF News? How do you feel about the Writ3rs user group as a whole?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] My first interview dates back to early October so about four months now. The group overall is really fun and tight knit. I'd say we're the closest group of individuals in a particular pseudoclique. There's not a single member on the news team that I don't like (except Lovol). Plus I'd say we're pretty efficient at getting the news together for how lazy the majority of us are. I just wish you fucks reading this would stop posting on the news threads things like, \"omg great edition sir!\" because it's annoying to the other twelve of us who put in our fair share.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's a really good point, Sir does a lot for HF News, no doubt, but it's a team effort. Out of all of the groups you've been apart of, which one do/did you enjoy the most and why? What makes a group \"good\"?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Well as for past groups, Rhythm. Positive gave me an amazing oppurtunity to lead one of the greatest group of individuals on this forum, and my opinion on that has yet to be changed. The core twenty or so of us that made that group as active as it was had a bond that was unbreakable. But sadly, Big P needed some kesh and sold it and life went on. There were some other fun ones back then. Root before the drama. The Empire pre-2013 when they had a fourty member limit and it was actually worth being in. Logic, of course; I was the very first member in that group when Hex rebranded it from Coders. Nowadays, I stick to Infamous, Instinct, and the Writ3rs. I can relate to each one differently, and they're all relatively fun to be a part of. To be honest, the friendships I've made in HF groups is the only reason I'm still here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I never asked you this, but I ask it in all of my interviews; How did you stumble upon HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Well in late 2010, early 2011  I started getting into buying and selling OG gamertags and whatnot. At that time I kept hearing things like \"HF has the best tags\" from my buds, Soulmate, Cloudy, and A$AP so that lead me to signing up. Not to brag, but I took that section by storm and got pretty well known amongst those guys relatively quickly. I think I still have the thread Soulmate and I sold most of our tags in from 2011-2013 that has like 400 replies or something crazy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] True oG right here. It sure is sad what happened to that market eh? If MS would have fucked off that section would be more active than a motherfucker. What was your favourite tag you ever owned?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] It makes sense though. Microsoft doesn't want people making profit off their services. I don't think any company wants that, but after they reset a ton of tags in 2010 and people started mass collecting them they caught on. I still laugh at all the conspiracy theorists that claim Microsoft employees lurk that section. I can guarantee it's 90% of people just reporting them, not an employee. Anyway, my favorite gamertag I've owned was probably Saturday. Not sure why I sold my alias, to be honest. I know I got $500 out of it, so I must have been hurting for money. To whomever I sold that to, if you're reading this; message me. I have stack ready for you.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's a sick tag. It makes sense, but we're the ones who pay for the membership. It's all in the ToS though, and I understand why. Yeah I think MS has better things to to than to report the buying and selling of GT's. So if you could change one thing about HF (Either community or site related) what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] I don't think HF needs any major changes currently. Staff and mentors do a great job of cleaing up the forum all hours around the clock. As for the community, it has it's pros and cons. A lot of people are stat whores; rep, posts, groups, ect. and that annoys me. People just need to relax and be themselves. The good thing is, the people that are genuinly cool human beings, have become some of my best friends and I wouldn't have made them without HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I agree 100%. So, I know you're expecting a child, but I don't know much else about you? Care to share some basic information about yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Sure. I'm thirty two. About 5'11. Married as of 2012. I sing in my free time. Lead vocalist for a band. Some could classify my work as being famous, but I just do what I love. My wife and I enjoy playing video games and watching movies in our free time (if you couldn't tell from the name choices earlier). I own two corgis and a cat as companions. I browse HF for a few hours a day when I'm home from work. I encourage anyone to send me a PM with a picture of their pets. That will make me happy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, I was under the impression you were still in high school. I don't know why. Hopefully this will give other members a better idea of who you are. Which kind of music do you play and what instrument?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Fuck off. A lot of people thought I was a girl too, strangely. Probably because of my avatar and signatures. That's just an idol of mine, Lights. I suppose you could classify my music as screamo? I yell into a microphone and it sounds good most of the time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I'd like to thank you for joining us today, any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b]Saturday:[/b][/url] Love like a dream, like you're never waking.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=875895]Haste[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Hey Haste, welcome to this weeks edition of the news.

What brought you to HF? The gaming scene, or hacking?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=875895]Haste[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, a combo of both. Back in 2011 I got into Minecraft griefing, which in turn, introduced me to hacked clients and booters and such. Skid things, ya know? But I signed up in July, and made my first thread asking someone to make a Hacked client for me. I, of course, gathered quite a bit of hate, but I pulled through and became active on the forums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Do I remember griefing back in the day -- we've all done it at least once if you've played Minecraft. (But who hasn't?) What made you stay on the site? The community or is there something else?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=875895]Haste[/url]:[/b][/color] As I image a lot of people are on here for, the thought of becoming popluar and getting to be the leader of a group, or getting 10 thousand posts, or getting awards always kept me motivated. I also love the resources that are avalible on Hackforums, from coding to hacking. There's so much to learn and use. The community, not so much since I've never been a social guy, adding people on skype and such. I tend to just lurk around and get a laugh out here and there.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Ah, for sure! What do you do outside of the realm of Hack Forums?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=875895]Haste[/url]:[/b][/color] I am a highschool student like a lot of people on HackForums. I also play Hockey on a competive team. Other than that, I don't do much other than play PS4 and browse reddit.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] How's school going?

After Hs I would like to attend a university, I'm still kind of hazey on that though, not sure which  one I'd like to go to. After that, I would like to either do something with the stock market, or own my own computer retail store\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds like a fine plan. What about your plans on this site, if you have any? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=875895]Haste[/url]:[/b][/color] Just keep doin what I do I guess.

I would fix the member list, since it's kind of slow and clunky at the moment.

Today we're interviewing Understalker. Hey, bud. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] Shoutouts to my nigga Haydrazs, KFC, byte, Anon, Cyber and all the other coo' niggas.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds like an interesting bunch. First off, how did a member like yourself hear about the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] I started off on Hackforums trying to get a booter to DDoS a game server, one thing led to another, and I purchased Toxicboot.pw, when I hit the game server off I had personally felt like a L33T HAX0R.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well now you are a big h3ck3r by the looks of it. Over one thousand posts in the ratting section. Tell us about that? How'd you get into ratting?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I am a major l33t hecker. I started RATting after I thought DDoSing people was boring, when I got my first slave the feels within my body were high. I had then got into web exploiting, defaced my first site(the game server I was DDoSing in the first place) uploaded a JDB and got over 600 slaves that first day. I now had stopped RATting and help others who are interested in getting into it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see. What pointers do you have for people interested in learning how to rat? Any tips?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] Well, always try and keep your anonymity at a high level. That one slip up can get you fucked over, (not like people get arrested for RATting r0fl), however you may fuck with the wrong guy and end up getting fucked over by the person you 'hacked' in the first place.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see, well besides that you're currently a member of three groups here on HF. What are your thoughts on those groups and groups on HF in general? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] Groups mean nothing in all honesty. I was in four however had left one recently as I had no interest in the group itself anymore. However, what groups do help you get on Hackforums is a reputation. The more groups you are in the more 'cooler' you look to the new kids coming around. When I first joined I thought people in groups were ub3r l33t h3ck3rs.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm glad you feel that way. There are so many stat whores nowadays it's ridiculous. Speaking of which, do you have any suggestions to better the site's current state?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] In my opinion, Hackforums has no major changes needed to be done. The only thing I would recommend is adding a moderator in some of the sub sections e.g. the RAT section. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Tell us a little bit about Understalker as a person. First off, what made you think of that username? It's certainly unique.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url]      \"Understalker\" as a person is actually quite nice and outgoing. I get along with everyone, no homo. I thought of Understalker around 6 years ago when I was in need of a username for a gaming account, I actually have no idea how I came up with it.. I was young, so creativity was strong back then.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest whenever I see you post I read \"Undertaker\" after that wrestler or whatever. Anyway, do you read the HF news often? If so, what are your thoughts on our work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url] I read the HF news whenever it is up. It is quite interesting, however I mainly look at the first page with the bans/awards/repfucks as that's what interests me. BUT, the other sections are quite interesting as well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well thank you, Understalker the hacker, for the interview. Anything else to say before I go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1726101][color=white][b]Understalker:[/b][/color][/url]Shoutouts to all my niggas one more time. One more shoutout to my nigga Saturday for being a real nigga.\n[/spoiler]",

Currently, the app is free until March 14th, so make sure to get it now! After March 14th, you will be required to pay an annual fee of $5. With the bank being released, players can transfer their Pokémon from Black and White to the second version of the game.\n\n[color=white][b]Roll Out in Transformers Universe[/b][/color]\nAs of now, you can enlist in the beta for the new and upcoming game Transformers Universe. The game will be launched sometime this summer and is free to the public. The genre listed is a Free to Play MMO. Users will be using their browser to play the game, similar to games such as Farmville (Facebook,) Transformice and other popular web browser games. The game is said to be based off of an upcoming movie that has yet to be announced to the public. When you first join the game you'll start of by getting recruits of a squad you command. While playing solo or with friends you level up your squads. Many fans of the Transformers know the war between the Autobots and Decepticons and will fight against other people around the world.\nYou can read more here: http://www.transformersuniverse.com\n\n[color=white][b]Twitch Soaring High[/b][/color]\nThe wall street journal charts show that Twitch is currently the #4 largest site in the U.S. With thousands of viewers tuning in to watch their favorite streamers, Twitch is currently ahead of Facebook, Hulu, and Amazon! Twitch has not been around as long as other sites and it's soaring high in positive ratings. When tournaments are hosted for various different games, that category is filled with thousands of gamers. Whether it be to learn certain strategies like the pros or just to sit back, relax, and enjoy the competitive aroma. On an article from http://www.ongamers.com it states that 68% of the users on Twitch users have been watching TV less and less to sit down and watch streams. That's incredible. With League of Legends, Dota 2, and StarCraft 2 being the most popular games to watch, OnGamers state \"258% and 508%, respectively, in average monthly minutes watched compared to 2012.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nInterested in a brief history of gaming?

Though it's made a transition to Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and possibly even the next-gen consoles in the near future, it's original platform is still growing. That being said, Minecraft's PC version has just hit fourteen million copies sold. After the huge milestone, almost 50,000 more people have purchased the game all ready.\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot After Snapshot[/color][/b]\nIn further anticipation and preparation for their next biggest patch, 1.8, Minecraft developers have been releasing constant snapshots for bug fixes, addition tests, and overall productivity enhancements. In the latest snapshot, 14w05b, though, Mojang has made most of its additions for mapmakers, but surely there are some for survival users too. For survival, then, a change has affected activator rails and another change has affected the copying of books. Both of which are rather minor.\n\nFor mapmakers, though, several notable additions have been made. They include, but are not limited to: a spectator mode (accessible via /gamemode spectator), an invisible block to be placed as a placeholder, spectator ability to take on the display as mobs, and some command block entities. \n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nActivity has been good on HackerCraft for the first time in a long time (other than the past few weeks). The casino was fixed, server issues are getting better, and factions have been reimplemented to make plenty of users happy. There are some debates, but that's always going to happen.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]Hypixel[/color][/b]\nIt's been a while since Hypixel has been mentioned here, so I think it's time that they got their shoutout. As the year has progressed, plenty of new game modes have been added to their playlist in addition to some new ranks with respectively new benefits to them. Additionally, plenty of new server features have been implemented as well for an overall better time.

Around 3-4 people have been reported dead. Fifteen-plus injuries have been noted, too. It all happened around a petrol station. Cars in the vicinity went on fire, holes in the ground filled the area, and emergency vehicles came as soon as they could. It is said that a Twitter account owned by the Lebanese branch of the Nusra Front (Syrian rebel group, which has connections to Al-Qaeda) The Affiliates possibly involved also participated in a rocket attack, which also included another suicide bombing.  Marwan Charbel, Lebanon's interior minister stated: \"Suicide bombers often use stolen vehicles, and up to 400 cars had been stolen in Lebanon in the last six months.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Edward Snowden: Peacemaker or Enemy?[/b][/color]\nWith two Norwegian politicians nominating Edward Snowden, also known as the \"NSA Leaker,\" he may have a chance of winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The two who nominated him said that the leaked files have had more of a positive impact, instead of a negative one. When it comes to nominating people, you, your friend, anyone is eligible to be nominated. The Nobel committee will possibly consider Edward to be a nominee stating, \"We do not necessarily condone or support all of his disclosures. We are, however, convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden's whistleblowing has contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order.\" There's no current information that is available to the public regarding the other candidates. Committee members will soon be able to nominate others as well, and the winner will be chosen around October this year.\n\n[color=white][b]9 Year Old Hero[/b][/color]\nTyler Doohan and his family were inside of his grandparent's house when it suddenly caught on fire. As the house was being burnt down, he had saved six of his family members from getting hurt. They did suffer minor injuries, though. The fire was caused when his cousin's blanket caught aflame. How did the fire come about? Well, it is said to have occurred from an electrical outlet. Everyone was asleep at the time, and Tyler had woken everyone up. Sadly, he did not make it out alive. He was trying to help his disabled grandfather out of the house at the time. This past Wednesday, firefighters, neighbors, and many other close friends/relatives held a funeral service for Tyler. More than 100 firefighters attended. Even the local basketball of the church went. Sad and crying, his mother said that he put a smile on everyone's face and was a very humorous kid.\n\n[color=white][b]Beatings and Updates in Ukraine[/b][/color]\nDmytro Bulatov, a thirty-five-year old man who went missing on January, 22nd, states that he was tortured after participating in the protests against the government. Bulatov was discovered outside of a forest, where his kidnappers had dumped him. He is very grateful to be alive and states that he was \"crucified.\" Kidnappers hurt him as much as they could; he had his hands nailed, his ear cut off, and various cuts along his face and body. Bulatov stated, \"They crucified me, they nailed down my hands. They cut off my ear, they cut my face. There isn't a spot on my body that hasn't been beaten. Thank God, I am alive.\" The attackers have not been identified because Bulatov said he was in a dark room a majority of the time. Not only Bulatov was kidnapped, but other people were too. This week Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych revoked the anti-protest law that was passed last week. Since then, violence has slowly died down. The government officials are hoping to calm everybody down.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jTIISqnQV7AMM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Twitter Commerce Leaks[/b][/color]\nTwitter has been largely used for non-important things, such as play-by-play updates of TV shows. A recent leak shows that Twitter may be used for something a little better. This past week, images found by Re/Code show sponsored tweets that feature a buy button with a price-tag. This new feature will link products to a service called Fancy, allowing you to buy the item. There is no news as of yet detailing when it's rolling out.\n\n[color=white][b]DirectTV Subscribers Can Now Use Roku To Stream HBO Go[/b][/color]\nDirectTV has announced that they now allow customers who pay for TV and HBO will be able to use their DirectTV credentials to gain access to the app, and its features. This is a welcomed change, seeing as the customers couldn't use the service when it rolled out, which means they have been out of luck since 2011. This may also mean that they will allow authentication on Apple TV and Xbox 360 sometime soon as well.\n\n[color=white][b]Apple's iWatch and iOS 8 Are Supposedly Fitness-Focused[/b][/color]\nThere has been no real word on Apple's smart watch as of yet, but we may have some sort of idea on what it is all about. This new wearable tech will mostly focus on fitness and helping the user stay as healthy as possible. This also comes with news that a new app being developed by Apple, known as 'Healthbook', will be a crucial part of iOS 8. The watch and iOS 8 are supposedly going to work together to monitor several pieces of health and fitness data. As of yet, this is all just a rumor with Apple not confirming anything.\n\n[color=white][b]Lockheed Martin Testing Autonomous Convoy[/b][/color]\nThere has been quite a lot of news recently covering the automation of several things, including package delivery. This past week, Lockheed Martin completed testing of full autonomous convoys. This testing was for the Army and Marine's AMAS program. The test was completed using obstacles they might actually encounter, including humans and junctions. This technology could mean keeping soldiers safer by removing them from risk altogether. That being said, this technology is quite far away from being able to be deployed in battle.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j2bNJXw7KAGGS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Big Sean's \"Ashley\" Music Video[/color][/b]\n..it's basically a soft-core porno. Sex, nudity, the whole slew of everything that makes a soft-core porno. Big Sean went from banging to basically another manufactured rapper with no originality. It's terrible, and I've listened to every Big Sean track, unreleased and released. Watch it [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=fLBJwGZ8ahA]here[/url]. While in captivity, Sean is forced to watch his male and female kidnappers have sex as he's tied to a chair and repeatedly beaten. It's all pretty sick (not the good kind.) The bloodied Sean is eventually able to escape the motel room where he's being held, only to be shot, recaptured and forced to dig his own grave in the desert.\n\n[color=white][b]Lil Za Charged With Three Felonies In Fallout From Justin Bieber Raid[/b][/color]\nOne Bieb crew member down. Xavier Smith(Lil Za; terrible rap name) could reportedly face up to nine years in prison. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office charged the 19-year-old born Xavier Smith with two charges of possession of a controlled substance, for MDMA (a form of ecstasy) and Oxycodone, according to TMZ. Police found the drugs \"in plain view\" at Bieber's home on January 14th, where they were searching for evidence in the alleged egging of a neighbor's home. After being released from jail, Lil Za took to Twitter to clarify what he said was an unfair representation in the media: \"Honestly , the media is making me someone I'm not . But only those in my shoes can relate. ... These ppl get paid to make you look bad,\" he wrote on January 16th: \"Some stuff I've done has been wrong yes. but look at the position I'm in and the color of my skin. Cocaine? Really?\" He has since deleted his Twitter account.\n\n[b][color=white]Rihanna And Shakira's 'Can't Remember To Forget You'.[/color][/b]\nGirls and guys both got boners from it. Rihanna and Shakira may be singing from under a man's spell on \"Can't Remember to Forget You,\" in the brand-new video, they're somewhere near paradise, and doing just fine on their own. They're all up on each other, looks like the beginning of a lesbian porno. The two smoke Cubans in a cabana for two, spend an unusual amount of time dancing on walls and, at one point, hold each other with next to no clothing. Shakira did her sexy flexible thing, while Ri had a little bit of her time copying her moves since Shakira literally has no bones.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jT4JzXVrxHH7U.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n-=-=-\nLife. Life is a peculiar thing. We are all put in a completely unknown environment with nothing to work with, and yet, we attempt to make sense of it all. No one truly knows the truth. Perpetual fear and potential explanations fight for control over our conscious thoughts. Religion plays a major role in the ability of humans to cope with reality, although modern-day humans are beginning to step away from the falsities of theism. Life is a peculiar thing. Think about it.",
