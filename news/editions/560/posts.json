Every Member With All 5 Pumpkin Awards From 2021-2025![/url][/color][/size][/b][/u] - [b]by [mention=666] [/b]\n\nOctoberfest 2025 has wrapped up, marking the fifth consecutive year of this community-favorite event. With a unique pumpkin award released annually, only nine members have managed to collect all five, showing a true sign of dedication. This year was also the first time the award could be purchased, but most of these veterans still earned it the old-fashioned way. A great celebration of consistency, community, and a little competitive spirit that keeps the HF vibe alive each Octoberfest.\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6312222]Would you rather know your death date or your cause of death?[/url][/color][/size][/b][/u] - [b]by [mention=5] [/b]\n\nA thought-provoking (and slightly chilling) question that got members talking: if you could know your death date or your cause of death, which would you choose? OP leans toward knowing the date - a way to stop fearing the unknown. The thread sparked some really interesting responses as users weighed control versus curiosity. One of those simple \"what ifs\" that turns into a surprisingly human discussion.\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6312572]Reviving HackForums[/url][/color][/size][/b][/u] - [b]by [mention=1631830] [/b]\n\nA heartfelt post reflecting the nostalgia many HF veterans feel. OP wonders how both members and admins could work together to bring back the golden days - when threads and replies flowed endlessly. The discussion dives into the future of forums in the age of Social Media, Discord and Reddit, and what can still make HF stand out: community, creativity, and legacy.\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6312812]Hackhf.net[/url][/color][/size][/b][/u] - [b]by [mention=5705664] [/b]\n\nCreated by and for the community, Hackhf.net is an interactive puzzle and hacking challenge platform that rewards players with points as they solve missions. OP shares the frustration (and fun) of being stuck on one of the secret missions - a feeling many HF members can relate to. The site keeps the old-school hacking spirit alive, offering a playful and competitive twist that blends learning with pure curiosity.

After two years of using GPT, he notes its reliability but also its overly apologetic nature, sparking others to share their experiences and preferences. The thread highlights how integrated AI has become in day-to-day development and how each model brings its own flavor to the coding table.

Level 1, The Reflection, points to a Pastebin gate, you need the password to access it. Keep it simple-think light, think easy. Submit the key privately, silence is part of the test.

This section will grow over time to more things, but for now we are just going to be doing Song of the week. We are open to what more we could bring to the section from your suggestions, but as a start, we feel adding the song of the week will be a great start for the section and lead the way forward for more things in the future.\n\nNow we know some of you may question what the song of the week is all about, and we have thought of what a great answer. We feel like the song of the week should be a meaningful song that goes deeper than just general music and has meaning to it all. Granted, we may have a little fun with it sometimes. (Yes, we will have a Halloween version and Christmas version too.) But we want to keep it at a level where we have found the song has a true message behind it all and not just something that everyone will just see as another song that is just a bit catchy or got a good few beats to it. We hope this helps those with that question and if anyone has anything that they wish to ask, please feel free to add them below. We are more than happy to give the reason behind it.\n\nThis weeks Song Of The Week:\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVjk5nrb_lI&list=RDsVjk5nrb_lI&start_radio=1&pp=ygUWc3Bvb2t5IHNjYXJ5IHNrZWxldG9uc6AHAQ%3D%3D[/video]\n\n[hr]\n\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/spec-ops.png[/img]\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=5550319]\n\n[size=large][u][b]CISA Flags VMware Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked Hackers[/b][/u][/size]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday added a high-severity security flaw impacting Broadcom VMware Tools and VMware Aria Operations to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, following reports of active exploitation in the wild.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The vulnerability in question is [color=#FF4136]CVE-2025-41244[/color] (CVSS score: 7.8), which could be exploited by an attacker to attain root level privileges on a susceptible system.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]\"Broadcom VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools contain a privilege defined with unsafe actions vulnerability,\" CISA said in an alert. \"A malicious local actor with non-administrative privileges having access to a VM with VMware Tools installed and managed by Aria Operations with SDMP enabled may exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the same VM.\"[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The vulnerability was addressed by Broadcom-owned VMware last month, but not before it was exploited as a zero-day by unknown threat actors since mid-October 2024, according to NVISO Labs. The cybersecurity company said it discovered the vulnerability earlier this May during an incident response engagement.[/color]\n\n[color=#0FF]Read more -[/color] https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/cisa-flags-vmware-zero-day-exploited-by.html\n[size=large]\n[b][u]Proton trains new service to expose corporate infosec cover-ups[/u][/b][/size]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Some orgs would rather you not know when they've suffered a cyberattack, but a new platform from privacy-focused tech firm Proton will shine a light on the big breaches that might otherwise stay buried.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Launched on Thursday, Proton's Data Breach Observatory aims to scour the dark web for details of breaches that don't reach the likes of regulators' portals, or those that the affected organization simply hasn't acknowledged.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Proton said in its announcement that the Data Breach Observatory will launch with a roundup of 2025's incidents to date, identifying 300 million individual records across 794 attacks.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Excluded from these are the often lofty figures associated with infostealer dumps, which typically garner the clickiest headlines but concern data that is routinely duplicated, old, or otherwise mundane.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The Data Breach Observatory will feature only attacks that targeted lone organizations rather than such aggregated cases. Without this exclusion, the number of incidents it would have collected would be nearly double, and the number of affected records would be in the hundreds of billions, Proton said.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The Swiss privacy biz said there isn't enough transparency around data breaches, and there is a growing market on the dark web for stolen details, such as credentials and sensitive personal information.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]In 49 percent of cases examined so far this year, passwords featured among the leaked datasets, and sensitive stuff like records related to government services or healthcare were found in more than a third (34 percent).[/color]\n\n[color=#0FF]Read more -[/color] https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/proton_data_breach_observatory/\n[size=large]\n[u][b]UNC6384 Weaponizes ZDI-CAN-25373 Vulnerability to Deploy PlugX Against Hungarian and Belgian Diplomatic Entities[/b][/u][/size]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Arctic Wolf Labs has identified an active cyber espionage campaign by Chinese-affiliated threat actor UNC6384 targeting European diplomatic entities in Hungary, Belgium, and additional European nations during September and October 2025. The campaign represents a tactical evolution incorporating the exploitation of ZDI-CAN-25373, a Windows shortcut vulnerability disclosed in March 2025, alongside refined social engineering leveraging authentic diplomatic conference themes.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The attack chain begins with spearphishing emails containing an embedded URL that is the first of several stages that lead to the delivery of malicious LNK files themed around European Commission meetings, NATO-related workshops, and multilateral diplomatic coordination events. These files exploit the recently disclosed Windows vulnerability to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands that extract and deploy a multi-stage malware chain, culminating in PlugX remote access trojan (RAT) deployment through DLL side-loading of legitimate signed Canon printer assistant utilities.[/color]\n\n[color=#0FF]Read more -[/color] https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/unc6384-weaponizes-zdi-can-25373-vulnerability-to-deploy-plugx/\n\n[size=large][u][b]Major US Telecom Backbone Firm Hacked by Nation-State Actors[/b][/u]\n[/size]\n[color=#39FF14]Ribbon provides communications and networking solutions that enable organizations to reliably run phone calls and data networks.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The firm says its solutions are used by service providers, enterprises and critical infrastructure organizations. Its website lists BT, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, CenturyLink, TalkTalk, Softbank, and Tata as its customers, along with the US Department of Defense and the City of Los Angeles.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]In a quarterly financial report submitted recently to the SEC, Ribbon said it discovered unauthorized access to its IT network in early September 2025.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]An investigation showed that the hackers may have gained initial access as early as December 2024, but the probe is still ongoing.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Ribbon has not shared any technical details on the incident, but said a nation-state threat actor is believed to be behind the attack.[/color]\n\n[color=#0FF]Read more -[/color] https://www.securityweek.com/major-us-telecom-backbone-firm-hacked-by-nation-state-actors/\n[b]\n[u][size=large]A federal judge has ordered spyware maker NSO to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.[/size][/u][/b]\n\n[color=#39FF14]The ruling, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO in 2019. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones—many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials—with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure.

The attack works on all Windows versions unless SMB signing is required.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Microsoft addressed this issue in the October 2025 Patch Tuesday.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]Kerberos is widely used for secure authentication in Windows environments. However, when misconfigured Service Principal Names (SPNs) and default permissions align, attackers can exploit Kerberos reflection to gain SYSTEM-level access remotely.[/color]\n\n[color=#39FF14]We reported these findings to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) in June 2025. Microsoft released a security update for the issue, cataloged as [color=#FF4136]CVE-2025-58726[/color], in October 2025.
