This is due to testicles harboring the coronavirus, and it gives a sanctuary from the immune system, which allows the infection to persist for longer in males. From the statistics of the virus, males are more affected by the virus in general, but this could be the main reason why more males are getting the infection than females.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]Entertaining Threads[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6074468][color=#FFFFFF]Favourite Pokemon[/color][/url] - IPIKIN\r\nPokemon, some of us grew up with it and some of us are still just learning or even hearing about it.

Now, the Model S Long Range is rated 348 miles until it needs to be completely recharged. Musk believed that it would be the first electric vehicle to have a 400-mile range, but the EPA test was short and reported that the Model S Long Range was suitable for 391-miles. Musk pointed out why the vehicle did not reach the distance it was supposed to have, \"someone had left the keys in the vehicle and the door open overnight, causing the Model S to enter into a \"waiting for driver\" mode that depleted 2 percent of the vehicle's battery.\" The EPA refuted these allegations that no one left the keys in the vehicle and the door open overnight, and the test was carried out correctly.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244556/elon-musk-lie-epa-tesla-model-s-range-miles-mistake-door] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]iPhone SE 2020[/color][/b]\r\nApple recently launched the second version of the SE iPhone.

This new budget phone from Apple took the crown of the greatest bang for your buck. Although it's an improved version of the iPhone 8, Apple played their cards right and knew they'd be able to catch their customers' attention with this refresh. Sacrifices had to be made for the price range, but they were clever about their sacrifices and put out a budget phone that's faster than any Android phone on the market. Google is also launching its Pixel 4a soon, so it may not be a bad idea to see how it compares if you're looking for a new phone.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a32292901/iphone-se-review-2020/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Uber Cracking Down[/color][/b]\r\nUber is taking new measures to ensure that their drivers and riders remain safe during these times of the outbreak of COVID-19. Uber will achieve this by implementing a new policy that will use new technology for drivers and riders to identify that they are wearing their masks. If it is discovered that a driver isn’t wearing a mask, they won't be able to accept requests from riders resulting in no income. “As countries reopen, Uber is focused on safety and proceeding with caution. Today, we continue to ask riders to stay home if they can, while shipping safety supplies to drivers who are providing essential trips. At the same time, our teams are preparing for the next phase of recovery, where we will all have a role to play.” This new requirement will only be accountable in certain markets when the policy gets pushed out.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/03/tech/uber-drivers-riders-face-masks/index.html] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4570721][img]https://i.imgur.com/yvPPn5U.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Seitokai Yakuindomo Sequel Movie Releases Key Visual and Trailer![/color][/b]\r\nA trailer was released for the upcoming comedy anime, Seitokai Yakuindomo's second movie.

The studio was built back in the early '80s and famous hits such as MMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya were created in this studio. Very recently, the rebuilding of the studio was complete. Additionally, the Japanese government will distribute 3,314,438,000 yen (about US$30 million) between the studio itself, families of those who lost loved ones, and those who were injured.

Dash Anime's 'Chapter Chitose' Episode[/color][/b]\r\n\"Jashin-chan Dropkick'\" otherwise known as \"Dropkick on My Devil!! Dash\" is the second season in the Crunchyroll original series Jashin-chan Dropkick. The anime premiered this spring 2020 season on April 6. What made this release special was that Crunchyroll released all 11 episodes of the anime at once! Recently a special 12th episode of the show, \"Jashin-chan Dropkick': Chitose-hen\" which takes play in the \"Chapter Chitose\" arc in the manga has been released. We will be introduced to a new character by the name of Lierre (Rie-ru) who is voiced by a Chitose City native. Lierre is described as one of the head angels, which means her ranking is above Pekora, Poporon, and Pino. AnimeNewsNetwork states \"The episode is funded by Chitose's hometown tax program, in which taxpayers can donate to city programs in exchange for tax breaks and other incentives. The story will deal with the process and incentives of the hometown tax program.\".

It is not known for sure whether or not this COVID-19 epidemic will calm down by then, so with that being said keep in mind, you might not have a season filled with as much anime as you were expecting, just like how a majority of the anime this season are getting canceled.\r\n\r\nWhy consider the delays now? One of the hardest problems right now due to the virus is getting the voice acting done in time for it to be mastered and then matched to the animation it is going to be voiced over. The voice actors work in a group together in a room specifically for recording, so there are not any echos and you can ensure the utmost quality. Since everyone is to remain at home and only go out when needed, it's very hard to get everyone into one room and record the voices. Some voice actors will have a recording studio and their home which they can use, but this is not the case for everyone. Another thing that is being affected the most is the production itself. ANN states, \"China and South Korea, which are dealing with their own COVID-related struggles.\".[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2020-04-21/sponichi-anime-scheduled-for-july-october-are-already-considering-delays/.158804]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega Mix Switch Game Heads West on May 15[/color][/b]\r\nIf you are a fan of rhythm games, then you are in for a special treat as Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega Mix will be making its way to other countries outside of Japan this May 15. At the current time of this article, you can download the demo and play now! If you are familiar with the Hatsune Miku games on the PS4, then you are most likely familiar with how this game works. If you have not seen the Hatsune Mike games before or rhythm games for that matter, check out this trailer [url=https://youtu.be/IHPYsFgGLXw]here[/url].\r\n\r\nThe game was originally released in Japan at the start of the year, back in February. This game also marks the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Hatsune Miku game series. You can purchase the base game if you wish, but if you are an ultimate fan, you will be able to purchase an extra DLC pack, called the \"Mega Pack\". The Mega Pack will include six new songs and the price will be $6.99. Altogether, the game will have over 101 songs (if you purchase the DLC). Additionally, you will be able to customize your Hatsune Miku character with 300 different costumes! [i][size=x-small][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-04-21/hatsune-miku-project-diva-mega-mix-switch-game-heads-west-on-may-15/.158787]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Demon Slayer Ripoff Game Released In South Korea[/color][/b]\r\nJust five days after its release, the Korean smartphone RPG game that goes by the name of \"Gwisal-ui Geom\" in English romanization announced that their application will be shutting down. The application was critiqued by players in Japan and Korea on how similar the character designs were to the popular anime, Demon Slayer. The game was launched on April 24 and the main focus of the game is to slay demons that killed his family, which is also similar to Tanjiro, the main character from Demon Slayer.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this even more peculiar is that there were additional add-ons in the game you could purchase. Not only did they knowingly steal someone else's work, but they were looking to make a profit off it too.\r\n\r\nThe game developer, Tennine, was interviewed by a Korean game news website where they stated, \"People only think that the two properties are similar because of the Japanese-style clothing and the basic\".  The statement in their apology announcement did purposely left out any mentions of plagiarism, and instead of that there were problems with the game and it had to shut down. The game officially shut down on April 29.

Ultimately, it will have a successful outcome, but you might need to reflect and review key aspects of it as you go along.\n\nYou can make significant progress over the days ahead as Mercury connects with dreamy Neptune, potent Pluto, and expansive Jupiter. Linking up with the right people can bring inspiration, while following your instincts can encourage you to take a leap of faith. Something big is brewing, and you fully intend to make the most of it.\n\nCautious Saturn, currently moving through your sector of goals and career, turns retrograde on Sunday and remains so until the end of September.
