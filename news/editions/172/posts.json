To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://goo.gl/pxojJ]here[/url]. \n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibbtDZ715LhhGY.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Search Your Threads[/b][/color]\nWith the ever expanding array of features available to the members of Hack Forums, this week sees the addition of the \"SYT\" button, short for \"Search Your Threads\". Although the \"Your Threads\" link in the navigation bar of the forum supplies access to the most recent thirteen pages of threads, any threads beyond that will not be accessible or easy to find without a direct link. The new SYT button aims to change that, allowing members to easily see their threads for each section, no matter how old it may be. In order to use this feature, one must navigate to any forum section page, such as the Lounge or Marketplace, and simply click the button located at the top right of the page, right next to the Mark (Mark Read) button underneath the New Thread link. As a result, all of the threads posted by a member in that section will be shown. The addition of this feature has resulted in some nostalgic experiences for members, who for the first time have a simple way of looking at how their posting activity has changed over the years. The announcement of the change can be read on the thread posted by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] on [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3907728]this thread[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]BTC & LTC MyCodes[/b][/color]\nAnnounced on [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3912653]Hack Forums[/url] and [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/409222631523504128]Twitter[/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url], the members of the forum now have a simple way of accepting BitCoin and LiteCoin payments. As long as a user has either the BitCoin or LiteCoin wallets installed on their machine, links posted by others can be used to launch the respective applications in order to easily send payments to a predetermined address. To use this new feature, surround your address with special tags, similar to posting an image or a website URL. An example is shown below:\n[php]\n[btc]1BRAPs1KT4k8xazJVCLkc1ujKeDPqQHKLa[/btc]\n[ltc]LWoLSRv5YwTfYsgv9LgP1sWUoUUtxsDAWB[/ltc]\n[/php]\nUsing these MyCodes will result in the following:\n[btc]1BRAPs1KT4k8xazJVCLkc1ujKeDPqQHKLa[/btc]\n[ltc]LWoLSRv5YwTfYsgv9LgP1sWUoUUtxsDAWB[/ltc]\nAs the use of these crypto currencies increases in use here, the addition of this feature is something many members will no doubt be using.\n\n[color=white][b]Hack Forums Database Not Leaked[/b][/color]\nMembers may have been alarmed this week to learn of a supposed leak of the Hack Forums' database, apparently resulting in a list being posted on [url=http://pastebin.com/MUNfxRpe]PasteBin[/url] with the usernames and passwords of a decent amount of user accounts. Although some usernames may coincide with usernames being used on this forum, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] has alleviated all fears by posting a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3914584]thread[/url] and a [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/409515160210927616]Twitter status[/url] on the matter. He clearly states that the database has not been leaked except for the user table dump which took place years ago, after which users were forced to change their passwords immediately. It is expected that the posted dump was actually the result of a breach in another site, causing some usernames to be similar or equivalent to those on Hack Forums. As a matter of fact, the passwords that were used in the dump are not even possible passwords for use on Hack Forums, as this site requires much stronger letter and number combinations. As a reminder, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] states that he always informs users of breaches in security and that they should not be fooled by rumors and lies. Lastly, remember that it is strongly discouraged to use your Hack Forums password anywhere else.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iyobmhGt2yol0.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=182754][color=#99FF00][b]Orgy[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=166074][color=#00AAFF][b]Calibur[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923197][color=#00AAFF][b]KyleWTF[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=#EFEFEF][b]Assailant[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation points.

Today we're interviewing Nate. How are ya? Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] Hi, I'd like to say hello to Diabolic, Hefto, Tando, ASVP and Clique.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] So, to start this off. What brought you to HF just about 2 years ago? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] I was banned on my first forum for god knows what; TheTechGame, after I made the migration over here I though the website look liked shit, (Hack forums) but I have came to like it here and get used to the decent design. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Seems like you were into the gaming scene way back then. What games did you usually play? I've noticed that you're pretty active in some of the gaming sections here.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes, My first game I ever played was on the PS2. Right now I mainly play my PC, but I occasionally hop on the Xbox for a good game of Call of Duty. I play Counter Strike, and World of Warcraft. Those are possibly my favorite sections in all of Hack forums. I've actually played with you a couple times on World of Warcraft, and now you are an Addict.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Yeah, you've got me hooked. Have you ever tried out League of Legends? It's pretty popular around here.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] Yes, I tired out that game. I hate it compared to World of Warcraft. It really sucks and yeah. #WoW4number1\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Well, it is something different. That's for sure. Did/do you have any specific goals that you'd like to achieve sometime? A post milestone and whatnot.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] No, I just came here to post and make new friends. To bad I don't have any friends on this site. I guess my milestone was to get a 1k Rep and get into some groups which I acquired both of them. Sadly I did not complete the one of getting into The Alliance Because now it is up for sale, What a same Paradoxum and Vinnie.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] AAh, well that's a shame. Can you tell us a bit about what you do outside of the online world?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] Outside the online world, I play sports: Football, Baseball. Other than playing spots I usually hang out with my friends get drunk fuck bitches, and drink the pussy juice, But that's on Fridays and Saturdays. Rest of the week I usually go home and sleep Play some games and Browse Hack forums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds like you're having fun. What are going to be doing for Christmas break? Anything you want in specific?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] Um, I hope I get money so I can buy games, maybe some Marijuana, and finally some Alchoel (My Favorite is Ciroc;Thanks for asking). I just plan to go to lots of Christmas Parties, maybe  I can get lucky if I give her chloroform. Other than doing that dirty looked down stuff, probably paly Counter Strike, with a few of Hackforums friends. ANd just broswe hackforums and try to get myself the ltc award, my first award I ever bought.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Counter Strike is pretty hard to get used to, in my opinion. Which one? GO or Source? Also, do you think that LTC is going to rise like how BTC did? I believe it's over 1k now.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] I have been playing Counter Strike 1.6 all the way to GO. Yes They are very hard to get used to. The Counter Strike Series are way harder than Call of Duty. You can't run around a shooting (Shooting and Running). Also You cannot cross map Smg no scope head shot bullshit, lmao. I have no idea I am just getting into the LTC and BTC Game, Mainly I'm just gonna get a Moneypak to exchange. Have you played Counter Strike at all?\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Yeah, no lie. I have actually. I have both versions. You remember when BTC was crawling around $100 price? Yeah, I wish that I bought a few of them. Do you plan on upgrading to the new consoles, or staying on the old gen?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah I actually remember when you can by like 3 BTC For like $5.00. I should of took the chance \nlmao. Maybe later, I don't really play my Console that much I usually just play my PC, since it is a very good graphics and CPU. Especially when the consoles are like $500.. Like yeah Right... Are you getting the new consoles? What do you think if WoW gets added onto the Xbox one, it will be pretty cool/Bad...\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Forreal. Yeah, I'm actually going to. My wallet hurts. I think it's going to be really different. Might be the same as D3 actually. Anyways, we've come to the end of our interview. It was pretty' fun. Any closing statements?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1087815]Nate[/url]:[/b][/color] West Side Tree Top Gang[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604]Tycoon[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to the 172nd edition of the HF News. Today we're joined by Tycoon who's formally known as H²O. Do you have any shoutout's you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] Hi Clark and thanks for having me here. Not to big on the shoutout's but here is a few. Yourself, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1671547]Keyser Soze[/url], and an unheard of member, whom I will be releasing a new product with soon, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1358768]bam422[/url].\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, would you mind telling us a little about the product you plan on releasing? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url]   It has to do with League of Legends, at this point that is all I can say.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Ok, well we'll be on the look out for it. How did you find your way to Hack Forums and what made you want to stick around?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] I was told about Hack Forums by a friend. I joined mostly because of the marketplace section. I liked how there was such a variety of products being bought and sold for cheap prices. I started getting into in and making a lot of money. That is probably what made me stay.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I've noticed your into the GT Scene. How's that been going recently? How do you feel about the GT scene as a whole?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url]  Eh not as much as I used to be. Gamertags are something I really enjoy dealing with because I play Xbox a lot. The tags that I have right now are awful to be honest. Not talking about all the banned ones I have. The GT scene took a hit not long ago with lots of tags being banned but that has been going on for a while. True risk and reward market.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah I've noticed a huge decline in original tags and a huge increase in price. Do you believe it's a matter of time before the market dies completely?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url]  I do. At the rate that they get banned or forever lost, the market does not have much time left. Get them while you can.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Make sure your listening to this lad right here, if you want an original gamertag go get one now! Aside from your product you'll be releasing soon do you have any future goals or plans on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url]Now that I am in college, I don't think that I would have to time to dedicate to being a Mentor or a group leader. I plan on just staying as high quality and reputable as I can, while not having a ton of responsibilities that consume my everyday.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good call, college life will keep you busy. What classes are you taking right now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] Calculus II, Engineering Graphics, Chemistry I, Science and World Cultures and my university class. My major is Civil Engineering and a Tech school. Spare time is usually spent with my girl or sleeping.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh wow, quite the load. Well best of luck with your educational pursuits. So if you could change one thing about Hack Forums, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you. \nWow, if you would have asked me at anytime I would have a great answer, but as of right now, I've got nothing. I am really anticipating the vouch system and the new usergroup though. I hope they come fast.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah, we've all been waiting for that new system for awhile. It will be nice when it's implemented. What's one thing you find HF does really well?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] HF controls is members very well. With warning levels, bans and everything. If someone posts something they aren't supposed to they get warned and the thread/post is deleted almost immediately. If a member does something stupid, they pay. Always, never fails. I feel like it is what other forums lack.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I agree. Speaking of other forums; Which other ones are you on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] hackforums and hackforums. Just fun sometimes to see a new community with different rules and see how things go. I go by the same name or them both so I am identified with who I am on HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So what are some of your interests outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] I am a sports fan. I like hockey, baseball and football. School pretty much consumes my life so I don't have time to do a lot of things like. I am lucky to have my great girlfriend to keep me going through my studies. Money would have to be my number one interest. Go to school to make money and that is what I try to do here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh cool, who's your favorite hockey team?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] Nashville Predators. I go to school about an hour and a half from Nashville so I like to go and watch every so often.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Nice. As a Canadian I also love hockey! Anyway, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. Do you have any last words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1658604][color=white][b]Tycoon:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you Clark. Just want to say how awesome this site is and long live HF![/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039]Assailant[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Hello, and welcome to the 172nd (gee whiz) edition of the HF news. Today we're interviewing Assailant. Anybody you want to give a shoutout before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for having me on board, well I'd like to say a huge thank you to iNviZ and Cryptic for giving me the opportunity to join the two groups I've been trying to join for a while now, I really feel like I've achieved something now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure you've been asked before, but what brought you to Hackforums a few years ago?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] I actually joined HackForums learning how to keylog, after learning how to do that I moved onto RAT'ing which I never thought would be possible, I always presumed it was something that was incredibly hard, which turned out to be extremely easy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Blackhat methods led you here, eh. That seems to be a pretty common theme. Nobody ever signs up for fun anymore. Anyway, I noticed you have over 2,000 posts in the Appraisals section. Is that your favorite section or is there another?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] I really moved away from all the blackhat crap, I was still a bit childish and always thought it made you look cool, the complete opposite now. As for the appraisals section, I used to love telling people how much their accounts and such are worth, but I'm having a little break from doing so, I will be back and appraising items again within a week or so. As for my favorite, it is and always will be the lounge, there are so many fantastic people in there, telling and showing is their fantastic stories, the lounge us and always will be my favorite.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'm a fan of reading all the outlandish threads in the lounge as well. It seems as if it lost some of it's funnier members since I joined though. More newer members with stupider threads. But to each is own. So you came to h4ck, and now you've moved away from that. What's in your future for Hackforums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] I have to agree with that. As for the future, just keep being the person I am, selling whatever comes across to earn some money on the side, keep in touch with some of the cool members I've met so far and ones I may meet in the future. I've been having some hard thinks lately about some services as such I could create to help the HF community, a free MM service as you may already know, I guess we'll just have to wait and see what comes a long.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Trust me, I know how you feel. I've been waiting for some inspiration for months now. Being associated with groups has been my main focus on HF lately. I assume the same for you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] Totally correct, my main focus for the past few months is getting myself into some of the bigger groups to actually get myself somewhere within HackForums. Over the past few day I've gotten myself into Infamous, The Brotherhood and Complexity. The motivation I have after being added to all three of them is incredible, it really is. I always though filling out applications and giving it half the effort would get me into a group, which was where I was going wrong, so I decided to spend a good amount of time on my applications, and become a lot more active and helping others out, I see it finally worked out for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Any other groups you aspire to become a member of in your HF career? Or are you pretty well of how you are now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] 143 is definitely a group I want to join. I love the groups I'm currently a member of, but 143 is a fantastic group, love the people in there, it just seems like they are a cosey little family.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You heard it first here, Daisy. Moving on, you've been here long enough to experience some major and minor changes to the site, whether it be a new theme, rule changes, ect. Is there anything you think would make the forum a better place. Now's your time to let us know without being judged on a suggestion thread.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] If I'm completely honest, I like it how it is, the new themes are cool, being stuck on one theme for a very long time does get a tad boring. As for changes, I want there to be a system that can help prevent scams, it hurts me to see how many people get scammed constantly on the site. I'm really not sure what the system could insist of, which is why I'd have to have a hard think about it before suggesting it, but yeah, I believe something a long the lines of that would help.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] What about the HF news. Do you read it? Any suggestions on how to improve it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] I do normally read it, I don't think anything could be improved if I'm completely honest. You guys do an incredible job, I must say that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Awh. So tell us a bit about Assailant as a person. Who is he off the internet?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] Well I study mixed media at college, we do film editing, graphics, animation and a little photography. I've been thinking about leaving the course at the end of this year and moving onto either an ICT course or a game development course, still yet to decide. I'm 17 and 6'5, always get told every where I go how tall I am, actually gets a little annoying at times, literally cannot even go into a shop and buy some food without them telling me I'm tall, lol. I like to play and watch football, I'm a big Celtic and Arsenal fan, it's weird supporting two teams but my Grandad brought me up to support Celtic, which I do and my whole family support Arsenal, which is why I support both. Both teams are ins separate leagues so I guess it isn't a big deal. Last but not least, I love gaming, especially Call of Duty, I make videos regularly and upload them to YouTube, I have had a HD PVR for a little over 3 years now, so I guess you could say it has been a hobby for that long.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the interview, you giant. Anything before I go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741039][color=white][b]Assailant:[/b][/color][/url] That's pretty much it, a big thank you to the news team, and a thank you to you for choosing me as an interviewee.[/spoiler]",

Bungie says that players will all be within the same world, that they will be Guardians watching over the last city on Earth. As Guardians, you and other players will fight against enemies that require both small and large groups of people; some might even require huge armies of online gamers to defeat.\n\n[color=white][b]Ubisoft Thinking About A Standalone Pirate Game?[/b][/color]\nAfter creating a huge commercial success with the pirate themed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, Ubisoft now might be considering eventually creating a stand alone pirate game. The ship gameplay in the recent AC game has been praised by many as an exceptional feature within the game that they would like to see in a new stand alone version, but with more challenge and less or none land play. As is typical of Ubisoft, they like sending out questions to costumers asking for their opinion on new release titles; they'ev done just that with Assassin's Creed. Players were asked if they would want to see a pirate based game not associated with the AC title that would be focused on a more complex pirate world. Players were also asked if they want to have a modern day character such as Desmond in future AC titles. What do you think? Check your email, they might have asked you.\n\n[color=white][b]LoL Professionals Prohibited From Streaming Rival Games[/b][/color]\nPictures of a contract between Riot and professional League gamers has been cause for a lot of public discussion last week, eventually causing Riot to change the terms on which the professionals had been prohibited from promoting any rival games. The contract didn't directly say that streaming was not allowed for the signed players, but it did give a strong feeling that any sort of promotion was disallowed. Especially Blizzard was a target with the contract, saying that no Blizzard content (WoW, Hearthstone, Diablo, StarCraft and WarCraft) could be promoted by any of the players bound by the LCS contract. The controversy over this contract most likely lies within the fact that a lot of the games prohibited by Riot were games that are far from being direct or even close competitors to the FTP brand League has. The competing companies also found the the contract odd, and with criticism and debate from other developers they finally decided to change it, admitting that the contract might have been a bit of an overreach. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nA video from June made by IGN that spills the beans on everything you need to know about Destiny this far. \n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufeImJJEqqU[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]1.7.3 Pre-Release[/color][/b]\nIn order to further integrate their Twitch.tv streaming feature and make sure that there are no unneeded bugs, Mojang has decided to release yet another experimental patch for Minecraft before the much anticipated 1.7.3. That being said, with their 1.7.3 pre-release, they didn't only further fix the streaming capabilities, but additionally optimized the patch and furthermore fixed any noticeable bugs that had previously been an issue. With this release, it's safe to assume that 1.7.3 is right around the corner.\n\n[b][color=white]Catching Fire Comes to Minecraft[/color][/b]\nAfter the sequel to the fan-favorite movie, The Hunger Games, many severs featuring such a minigame have taken it upon themselves to turn the movie's playing field into a map on their servers. Several that have been going around are definitely similar, but there are a few plot twists that really add a nice bit of uniqueness to them. If you play a lot of Hunger Games on Minecraft, it's likely you've seen a map like this, but if you haven't, it's definitely recommended to start looking around.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nAfter a scare with the server's host, Omniscient had made a thread postponing the much-anticipated updates; however, lighter news was later released in that the host would not shut down and that the updates were to actually happen. With that being said, the HackerCraft News will resume as soon as such happens.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]HiveMC[/color][/b]\nAs this server was featured in the past, something spectacular should've happened to have it be featured again-- and it did. After the sequel to The Hunger Games came out, the server had decided to throw in a very-accurately portrayed map of such in their hunger games minigame. So many people have enjoyed it so far, in fact, that 4/5 matches that you join will have it voted for.

Mandela's story is both fascinating and inspiring. While at university, he was approached by the African National Congress President to help create a youth league where he organized boycotts and strikes to protest the segregation of native Africans. Two years after becoming president of the ANC Youth League in 1950, Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act because of his organization's acceptance of communists. Mandela eventually came to the opinion that the ANC had no choice but to raise up arms in order to invoke change after peaceful protests failed to accomplish their goals. However, the Chinese government refused to supply them with weaponry. In 1956, Mandela was arrested for high treason but the charges were soon dropped. He co-founded the Umkhonto we Sizwe, a militant group which organized over 50 bombings in 1961. Mandela was arrested and would not be released until 1990. After his release, Mandela spent the next couple years meeting with foreign officials to encourage sanctions be placed on South Africa and organizing the largest strike the country had ever seen. In 1994 at the age of 76, Mandela won the presidency in the first general election that allowed citizens of all races to vote. His main focus during his administration was ending apartheid. Using a series of conciliatory policies and urging peace and forgiveness, Mandela pushed to create a “Rainbow State” where citizens of all races were treated equally. Nelson Mandela passed away last Thursday due to a lung infection. A 10 day national mourning period began on Friday, December 6th and will end with a state funeral on Sunday, December 15th.\n\n[color=white][b]Pope Francis Creates Anti Sex Abuse Committee[/b][/color]\nIn an effort to fight the sexual abuse of children that has notoriously plagued the Catholic Church, the pope has organized an official internal committee that will define a stricter code of conduct and better checks. Critics pointed out that this move came shortly after the Vatican refused to comply with a United Nations inquiry on the matter.\n\n[color=white][b]US Military No Longer Reporting Guantanamo Strikes[/b][/color]\nNavy spokesman Commander John Fiolstrat announced that the military will no longer be reporting Guantanamo hunger strikes. Reports of the hunger strikes were used by media and human rights groups as an unofficial measure for conditions in the secret military prison. Fiolstrat wrote, “[We] will not further their protests by reporting the numbers to the public.... The release of this information serves no operational purpose and detracts from the more important issues” (via [i][url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-stops-disclosing-guantanamo-hunger-strike-tally]the Associated Press[/url][/i]).\n\n[color=white][b]Snowden Documents: NSA Tracking Cellphone Locations Worldwide[/b][/color]\nThe latest Snowden document revealed that the United State's National Security Agency is collecting up to 5 billion records a day regarding the locations of cellular phones around the world. This data, the NSA says, does include information from Americans who travel abroad. While the intelligence agency may not have reason to suspect most users it collects data on, it uses a series of tools to determine “Co-Travelers” of known suspects by determining who travels near the same cell towers as the target. For a detailed explanation of how the Co-Traveler's analytics works, check out this [url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/how-the-nsa-is-tracking-people-right-now/634/]infographic from the Washington Post[/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Spotify Supposedly Working On Free Ad-Supported Mobile Streaming[/b][/color]\nThe popular music streaming service Spotify is supposedly developing a version of their mobile streaming app that will give users free streaming with advertisements in-stream. This echos the free version of the desktop app, which has ads in stream as well. Three major music companies have also reportedly signed licensing deals for the service. There isn't much more known at the time, but there will be an event this coming week that will explain more.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Rumored To Launch Set-Top Box Next Year[/b][/color]\nA rumor that has come out this past week that Google may be releasing a Nexus-branded set-top box in early 2014. The box is rumored to be able to handle most Android apps, using your phone as a controller for them. The box in question will not carry live TV, but rather streaming video from Internet services like YouTube and Netflix. This could put Google ahead of competitors if they do it right. There is no word of confirmation or denial of this rumor as of yet.\n\n[color=white][b]Twitter's Target Advertising Uses Your Browsing History[/b][/color]\nAfter being in a testing stage for 6 months, Twitter has now rolled out their changes that will tailor ads with information from your browser's cookies. The advertisers will be able to give Twitter browser-related details and thus can match ads up to a specific Twitter user. This information could include where they're located and browsing the internet at, and the websites they visit on the internet. Twitter has said that this will provide highly relevant advertisements to users, but you can opt out at any time from within the privacy settings. \n\n[color=white][b]Lumus Reveals Their Glass Competitor With In-Lens Display[/b][/color]\nLumus has recently revealed their Google Glass-like device that will likely be a big competitor for Google. Lumus has been known for it's military products, seeing as they are a heads up display manufacturer who have made displays for F-16 helmets. With this latest effort they are trying to get into the consumer market. Instead of using the device to project notifications to your peripheral, it will be contained entirely in the right lens, with a 640 x 480 display. Lumus has not released many details as of yet, but promises more to come at CES 2014.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Kanye West's 'Crack Head' Step-Brother Delayed His Career[/b][/color]\nKanye's latest podcast unleashes info about Michael Jackson and Mos Def's slams. \"I saved up all my money to get a sampler and I remember I had my stepbrother at the time, was living with him, and he told me like, 'Look, if you let me borrow this money, I'll give you $20 interest on it.' But then when I was getting close to it, he wasn't really getting me the money back. I remember my stepfather had told me one time, 'Don't ever loan him anything'... Come to find out he's a crack head and I didn't know it.\" Another thing he mentioned was that he once wanted to be a video game designer and Michael Jackson told him to sing.\n\n[color=white][b]Beyonce Wore Fox Fur To Her Meatless Lunch[/b][/color]\nJay Z and Beyoncé are just four days into their 22-day vegan diet, but already Bey is making waves. The super couple seem committed to a \"spiritual and physical\" cleanse. She was spotted wearing fox to lunch with Jay at a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles on Thursday, but is that okay? The paper said the singer was sporting a $4,800 Christopher Kane wool-blend parka with a real fur collar which, in strictest vegan terms, is a double faux pas. The couple reportedly dined on a marinated kale salad, Indian curried lentils and corn tacos with chipotle butternut squash, before enjoying vegan chocolate truffles for dessert. Celebs don't even know how to go vegan right...\n\n[b][color=white]Jay Z ranks his 12 solo albums.[/color][/b]\nIt should come as no surprise to die-hard fans that Jigga's 1996 independent debut, Reasonable Doubt, took the #1 spot. His critically acclaimed 2001 effort, The Blueprint, came in at #2, and his supposed 2004 retirement LP, The Black Album, ranked third, with Jay labeling each one a classic. Jay also counted his top-selling Vol.2 ... Hard Knock Life a classic, placing it at #4 on his list. His American Gangster album came next, writing \"4 ½, cohesive,\" in parentheses. His sixth favorite, Jay selected his most recent, Magna Carta ... Holy Grail, while placing his sophomore LP, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, at #7. Hov has said on many occasions that Vol. 1 was spoiled by a song or two. \"Sunshine kills this album ... f---,\" he wrote on the blog post, referring to the Babyface-assisted pop-heavy single from 1997. The Blueprint 3 took #8. \"Sorry critics, it's good,\" he defended. Next was 2000's The Dynasty: Roc La Familia album, which was released to help showcase former Roc-A-Fella artists Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Amil and Freeway. At #10 is Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter, followed by his double album The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse. Most critics would agree that Jay Z's 2006 comeback album, Kingdom Come, was his weakest.\n[spoiler=]\n[img]http://cdn.lifeandtimes.com/uploads/2013/12/disc.png[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nDo your shit.",
