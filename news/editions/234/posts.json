Members were presented with a global message that took them to a page with a QR code which when scanned, directed to a page which delivered the disappointing news: [i]\"April Fools! Yes, I know you want 2FA and seriously it's coming but for now I got a joke out of it.\"[/i] Those who could not pass the QR code flooded the support sections with their troubles using the new feature. Others reinforced the joke, such as [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][b]xadamxk[/b][/url], who wrote up a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4757186]tutorial[/url] on activating 2 factor authentication - which scored him the Jokester award.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Sales Tags out of Beta[/color][/b]\r\nAfter further consideration of members' input, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made available sales tags once more following a recode and they are now in version 2.0. Now purchasable at $6 OMC/week, sellers can decorate their marketplace threads with tags boasting sales, excellent returns, value for money, or popularity of the product. If you are interested in a sales tag for your thread(s), visit the purchase page [url=http://hackforums.net/salestag.php]here[/url]. Keep in mind this is an on-going project, more changes will follow to help further integrate the tags with the forum.

Have any shout outs you want to make before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Sure. Cybele, Ergo, The Protagonist, zixem, -zERAiT, team Elusive and Null\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] You seem to have been here for a while. How'd you get started with HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Oh you know, the usual. Years ago I had great interest in everything hacking related once my own server was hacked by a random kid. I was drawn into the same things most of us are still doing: Ratting, malware, general things. Took me a year, but I realized this isn't the way. I abandoned the Hosting scene, and I slowly picked up the way I considered more appropriate and learnt whatever I wanted to from the ground up.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I definitely have to agree with you on that. Did HF ever teach you how to \"hack\"?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] This is a really good question. It did a couple of things. The biggest of them was giving me the realization that I don't know fuck all (Sorry for the language) and that I need to learn as much as I can on my own, grinding the basics until I no longer need to ask anybody. You see, like anybody else I turned to the tutorials that are laying around everywhere. They told me do this and do that, but never once completely detailed about every single aspect of every single thing they tell you to copy and do. Why? Maybe it's too obvious, maybe they don't know, but this isn't the point. The point was, tutorials never gave me a clear grasp of a lot of things, I always felt disappointed with them. But the more disappointed I got, the more I searched and hunted knowledge from other sources: Google, stackoverflow, stackexchange, and more. I feel as if HackForums did teach me how to hack, by letting me know that it doesn't. I learnt how to hack as a side-affect of my own self-research on my own projects, books, VMs, and targets.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I see. Since we're on the topic of tutorials, you seem to have a \"Teaching HF\" project. Care to tell us more about that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Sure. After my own research slowed up as I felt the ends of my interests becoming near, I felt like breaking this wicked cycle of not-knowing-what-to-do-when-you-start. I started off with the wrong foot. You can see it yourself, if you go to my threads at 2010/2011. I was wrong. I was a skid. I did not want to have anybody else experiencing it, so I did a bizarre thing. First, I saw a thread made by somebody about how to hack - A service. He wanted cash for it. I really hated it, so I copied the title exactly and just made it free. Later on, somebody donated me a sticky. It was hilarious. I added everybody that wanted to begin, on Skype, and I slowly explained him where to learn what he wants to learn. No, I did not threw them everything on a silver spoon, as I've learnt on my own - You only get it once you hunt enough for it. I gave them basic language resources and watch them grew. Not a lot of grew. This was quite a sad moment of truth. I added... 700? 800? People, and I dedicated my attention for their own success. The absolute most of them gave up next week. But the ones that did made it? I couldn't feel more proud. It felt so good knowing that you caused somebody to become better, and he'll continue to become as now he knows how to. Some of them are now on my team. Some of them are not self-employed. One of them makes CSGO hacks. Another hacked the biggest email provider in his country. While I'm not exactly supporting these causes, I can't be bothered to feel bad by that. It's their choices.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] That must be a pretty good feeling! Since 2010 all the way to now, how much have you learned? What exactly have you learned?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Website Development - HTML, CSS, JS(Not so good), PHP, SQL; Website Exploitation - All common and not common injection patterns, mapping out website applications and services, doing recon, fingerprinting, bruteforcing (Wildcards etc), and analyzing; Programming - C, C++, Python(Learning), ASM(x16 on 8086); Etc - CCNA level @ Networking, CPU Arch. A decent portion was learnt in an institute I was enrolled in last year.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] It's amazing to see you have learnt a lot. Looking back, I see you were apart of Team Digi7al. What was that group about?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] The group was about a small team up of several rather knowledgeable members. We were up to no good, to say at least. Things started out rather fine, I was invited along with zixem, and some more. We started out basic: Making tools, toolsets, a web-shell to aid hackers in their tasks, but slowly the team delved deeper and deeper into targets that are high-profile. First it was an online bark. It was rather stunning, how it all happened. A Phishing page rose up. Things heated up. I've noticed it early and stated I won't aid in any active part the procedures. Did I end up being involved? That I'll leave to the imagination.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] It seems to me there's a line you will never pass when hacking. Is that true?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah. I stand strict by my morals. I'll never use my findings and my capabilities to damage personal site users by any means - If I hacked a website, how can they be put to blame? They can't. The website owner, however, can be. Even though, on most of my time I showed disgust at defacing and generic code removal of the original site. I find it insulting. Anyway, I'd rather stay true to what I feel when I'm active at these fields, and it can be shown at my teaching project as well. I never charged a cent from anyone. Ever. And I'll never will.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What do you think about the members who are asking how to set up a RAT, how to DDOS, etc.?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] First I was one of them. Then I felt above them and hated them with all my might. Now I just ignore them. They're on a phrase, and they choose whether to stick in that phrase of simply having fun. Having fun on somebody's lack of knowledge that you're in his system, having fun possessing the control of being able to raise a switch and bring down a huge network skilled people made, skilled people wrote and operate. If they choose to remain in that position, the best I can do is point them in the right direction and move along. If they want out, though? I'll gladly help them by any means possible. They are, after all, wasting their time as well as breaking quite a lot of law, both human-wise and country-wise. One thing I still despise though, is the money making scheme behind all of this. There's the people at the top producing these products and I believe they are well aware of their capabilities... And they choose to further poison the community with these products, and the rest of the world, with the included suffering that home users have because of them. These people know how to do things and they choose money as their first priority. Truly shameful.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] To me, people who use a RAT, DDOS, etc. are just doing it because it's the easy way out. Is there ever an \"easy way out\" with real hacking?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Never. There's no magical button for this, no easy way out. If you truly want to get \"real\", you'll have to get to the bottom of things and just grind. Otherwise you'll remain in the position of clicking buttons like a sheep and not understanding what you're doing and that's not hacking, that's boring :)\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] When you first started, were you ever confused? A lot of people give up on real hacking because it's too \"complex\", too hard to understand.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] I sure was. I first got to the hacking tools section expecting this to be all easy, yet I got constantly confused because I wanted to learn more, yet I learnt backwards. It took me a lot of time to realize that I'm approaching all of this in the wrong way instead of throwing all of this aside and re-learning from the ground. And to be blunt, it's not complex. It takes a fair amount of logic to understand, I bet, but it's completely possible with the right amount of dedication. Is it hard understanding that <this> opens a block that is doing stuff and </this> closes it? Is it hard to grasp the idea that you write words in-between quote signs to represent a string, so when you put a ' sign at a URL parameter you're basically opening a new string that isn't closed and if the server doesn't authenticate it's input, this will actually work and might put up an error revealing a possibility to inject SQL Code? This isn't complex. You just need time, and will-power to sit through it. And I'm not even there, like, I still learn everyday and I'm far off where I want to be, because there's new worlds and subjects I want to learn, say, low-level exploitation, I find it so hard and complex. But when somebody explains it to me, it's all easy for him. So maybe am I over-simplifying this? Maybe. But I think all of us who feel this is interesting, should try.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] We've been talking about your online life for quite some time now. What do you do outside of the internet?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Not a lot quite frankly. I'm 17, recently broke up with a cutie pie, studies quite well in highschool and an institute that teaches me certain things, I love reading and wasting countless hours brain-dead facing a Netflix screen. Just your average guy, really. Next year I'm enrolling the military in my country, I believe it'll spice up my life a bit.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sorry to hear about that breakup.

I'm going to say you started learning how to hack at the age of 12-13?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, around that.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, that's pretty young, but it's a good thing. Thanks a lot for your time Th3PonyWizard! Would you like to say anything else before we wrap this up?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=531250][color=#FFFFFF][b]Th3PonyWizard:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah. It might seem jackass out of me to talk about what I did and know like some sort of an elitist, but I don't know that much and it's not the reasoning of why I'm talking here. I wanted to give you guys the image of what's it like from my vision, the other side of the coin and how better everything can be if people will leave out their comfort zone and try harder, for once. Thanks for the interview, I always wanted an opportunity to share my thoughts.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331]Cryptic™[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 234th Edition of the HF News. Today we have Cryptic™ with us. Do you have any shout outs before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] No.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting! I see you've recently made a return to Hack Forums after a nearly 6 month absence. How was your break from the site? What did you miss about it?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] Prior to leaving HF, I was operating one of the largest VPN's in the market place, whilst also providing the backend infrastructure to many of the other VPN's in the market place (which I continue to do today). The 2 years I was running the VPN business was very stressful and time consuming. My objective before I started the project was to make enough money to pay off my tuition and also last me about 3-4 years after I graduate. Once I achieved that goal, I had no need to continue, so I packed up and decided it was time to step away from HF, and use my newly found free time to do something else. The 6 months I was away was very stress free and productive. I had a lot of time to spend on other things, and got a lot of things done, that I've been wanting to do for a very long time. I'd recommend everyone to try taking at least 3 months away from HF, and do something productive. Weather it be working towards better grades, or getting a full time job, or just spending more time with your friends and family. To answer your question about what I missed about the site, I didn't miss much about it. I only talk to a very small circle of people on the site, and we keep in touch via other contact methods.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Nice. What do you think is missing from HF? What improvements would you like to see?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] 2FA is really needed on the site. Users accounts get jacked all the time, and high profile users are usually the main targets. 90% of the time people fake it and use it as an excuse when they scam people. I'd also like to see better Group Management features. I have a lot of ideas for group features, and I'll post a thread about it in the future when I have time to write it up.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Well we'll be looking forward to it. How about The Brotherhood? Do you have any plans now that you've returned?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not planning on selling the group for at least another 3-4 years. I don't like it when people buy groups and just use it to make money by doing things like selling spots or memberships into their various programs/sectors, and then just sell the group a few months down the road. I call that, milking/churning groups (Buy a group --> Sell spots --> Sell Group). There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm not a fan of it, and I find it pathetic when that's the only thing they do. Most people don't think long term, and just have the short term mentality. I've never done that, and don't plan on partaking in any of those activities. So it's safe to say BH will be around for a very long time. I had an idea a few weeks ago that I plan on putting into action. It will be something no other group has done before, and it will benefit anyone planning on having a career related to IT.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Glad to hear that The Brotherhood is here to stay. I couldn't agree with you more about the group churning. So about the idea about benefiting anyone planning on having a career related to IT, will that be a Student program built from the group up or will it be something along the lines of a study group? Would there be any prior IT knowledge required for it?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] It will be a hybrid of both a student group and a study group. Yes there will be some prior IT knowledge required. They will have to have at least an A+ certification, or be in the process of obtaining one.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome. Do you have any certifications earned and which ones are you working on?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] I don't have any at the moment but I'm currently working towards my Network+. I have all the knowledge required for A+ but I find that it's not worth paying for. It's better to just have that knowledge and obtain something higher. My road map for the next few years is as follows: Network+ -> Security+ -> MCSA (Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate) -> Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) > Project Management Professional (PMP) by 2018.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Looks like you'll have yourself pretty busy for the next few years, best of luck with that. I see you've recently made a thread updating us about the Omc-rates.com page, what's new with that?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] OMC-Rates.com is the original OMC ticker/exchange rates calculator. I spent an hour yesterday and completely rewrote everything to be much more efficient. I also added in features that users have been requesting for a long time, such as an API and other coins. Today I released the API, and added in DASH, DOGE, and LiteCoin as per users requests.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Wow. That's a really nice update. I can see that becoming extremely useful for members looking to exchange currencies to buy awards on HF including the new DarkDash award. Do you have any big plans or implementations for the site? What are your thoughts on the future of the Omnicoin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] At this time I do not have any other ideas for the site. I don't see what else I can implement in it, I'll be looking forward to more suggestions. I think that all new CryptoCurrencies have potential. They can either go big, stay small, or just die out. OmniCoin is still pretty new and has a long way to go, and considering it's a coin that is backed by the one of the largest forums online, it does indeed have a lot of potential. I definitely don't see it going viral anytime soon, it will take time and a lot of hardwork. I'd recommend users to invest in a good amount of it, at least $20 and see what happens down the road.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] What do you think about the idea about Omniscient selling a group to the highest bidder with Omnicoin? Do you think these new implementations are effective in getting more people to invest in Omnicoin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] I think that it's a good way to give OMC the jumpstart it needs. It'll definitely draw more attention to the coin, but it has to happen farther down the road when OMC is a much more stable coin, and when theres more volume in trades happening to keep the value rock solid. As of right now the coin can still be manipulated when people manipulate the exchanges to drive the rate down.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=teal][b]Roger Waters:[/b][/color][/url] Some interesting insight there. It looks that's about all we have this week. Do you have any closing statements?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=gold][b]Cryptic™:[/b][/color][/url] I found that quote very inspirational and empowering. ([url=http://i.imgur.com/dS9NoaJ.jpg]Picture Link[/url]) One thing I learned over the past 2 years is that creating a vision for your self and then developing a timeline/roadmap for what you need to do in order to achieve them it is the best way to ensure that you actually achieve your goals and ultimately find success. Anyways, thank you for taking the time for interviewing me.\r\n[/spoiler][/align][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

If the transaction was covered by 2-factor authentication the malware will still get by it. Dyre Wolf uses a combination of social engineering, spear phishing emails and malware. In addition to all these attacks the Dyre Wolf criminals also use a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The criminals first use a spear phishing email to reach into the organization or corporation. They act as if it's an important document and once it's opened 'Updatre downloader\" uploads and executes the trojan onto the system. Once the victim tries to log into their bank account the malware displays a message saying the site has issues and that they need to call a certain number in order to do what they needed to do. This is where social engineering comes in because once they call that number they will be assisted by a real person. The real person is someone working with Dyre. They take all of the victims information then go ahead and make the wire transfer. Once that is done the Dyre gang sends a DDoS attack to the victim so they are unable to do access the bank account. The Dyre Wolf malware has successfully stolen over $1 million dollars from targeted enterprises.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b] Final Member of the \"Xbox Underground\" Group Has Plead Guilty[/b][/color]\r\nThe final member of the (XU) Xbox Underground group has plead guilty to stealing over $100 million dollars from Microsoft, Epic Games, and Valve corporation in intellectual property and data. In addition to all of this the group has stole an Apache helicopter simulator developed by Zombie Studios for the U.S Army which had then gave them access to access the U.S Army's computer network. \"Austin Alcala, a 19-year-old of McCordsville, Indiana, along with two other Americans and a Canadian, has found guilty to charges of computer hacking conspiracies and criminal copyright infringement involving theft of information related to then-unreleased Xbox One gaming console and Xbox Live games.\" Now the FBI has officially announced that all four members of this hacking group have pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Truecrypt Security Audited[/b][/color]\r\nFor several years, Truecrypt served as the Open-Source, free alternative for creating encrypted file containers, peripheral drives and devices, and whole-disk encryption. It was the top leader of encryption until May of 2014, soon after Microsoft stopper offering support for Windows XP, development on TrueCrypt had completely stopped. After the developers of the team left the project, they had put out a seemingly critical warning saying that TrueCrypt may contain unwanted security issues and that it would be safest to move to another encryption software. However, this was not taken lightly in the encryption community and suspicions of the program being 'backdoored' by federal agencies began to take root. [url=https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf]A 21-page security audit[/url] performed as part of the Open Crypto Audit Prroject disclosed a total of 4 vulnerabilities, none of which indicated a backdoor of sorts or a critical blow to encryption. The first of two critical vulnerabilities shows an API subject to silent failure which can allow it to insecurely generate random numbers. The second indicates that it may be possible to extract AES encryption keys from cache.\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]New Tool D efends Against Evil AP's[/b][/color]\r\nA common attack on wireless networks is the process of 'Cloning' which entails copying the connecting information of a WAP (Wireless Access Point) and waiting for people to connect to your fake WAP instead of the real one. This allows you to capture packets and information from the clients. The new application entitled [url=https://github.com/moha99sa/EvilAP_Defender]EvilAP_Defender[/url] is now able to detect many different AP's including ones that have a different BSSID, different attribute such as encryption protocol/channel/cipher, or different OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier). Once the tool detects that an Evil AP has been deployed, it can be set to automatically send de-authentication DOS (Denial of Service) attacks and it will also send you an e-Mail alert. Though this is aimed towards this being deployed in Business environments, it has a long way to go before it can be safely considered as a proper defense mechanisms. As of now, there may be several ways to deploy a WAP without being detected by this application, but it highlights the fact that we are taking strides towards better security for wireless networks.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ymeMSvr.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b]Obama Authorizes Sanctions to Combat Cyberattacks[/b]\r\nPresident Obama signed an executive order on Wednesday, April 1st (and no, this is not an April Fools' Joke), authorizing the United States to block financial assets of hackers involved in any cyber attacks against the United States. In a statement released by the White House, the Secretary of the Treasury is now allowed to “sanction malicious cyber actors whose actions threaten the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States.” after the signing of this order. In the statement it continues to state that the executive order is designed to go after the “most significant malicious cyber actors” and something that would not be used use every day.

Once on the site, vistors are served the \"Nuclear exploit kit\" through a drive-by attack. According to Malwarebytes Jérôme Segura, \"This exploit kit targets most browser plugins but it focuses in particular on the Flash Player which was affected by no less than three zero days in the span of a month.\" At the time of this report, there were no exact numbers on which sites or how many sites were effected by this attack.

Joe Sullivan, the one picked for UBER’s new position, was CSO of Facebook for multiple years and also worked in executive positions at PayPal and eBay. Sullivan’s main job is to overlook the cybersecurity aspect of the company. After the more recent data breaches that UBER has been accumulating lately, Sullivan has a long task ahead of him to bring UBER back into credible standing when it comes to data privacy. UBER’s cybersecurity is lacking with staff having higher administrative privileges than most companies would ever recommend. All the security issues aside, with the hiring of Joe Sullivan, UBER vows to fix any current issues with their data of customers and also assuring that they will continue to take security much more seriously than they had previously.

The anticipation for a release has been growing since the console’s release, with a 2015 release window being expected by many. However, in a recent development update by Nintendo, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma stated “we are no longer making a 2015 release our number one priority.” The result of this is that Legend of Zelda fans are going to have to wait longer for the series to make an appearance on the Wii U, with a release date of no earlier than 2016 being expected. However, the reported reasons behind the delay aren’t necessarily bad; uncovering new creative possibilities with the game, along with Nintendo’s constant strive for perfection, are what’s holding this game back from a 2015 release.

Spotify, a popular music streaming service, has not had an application available on any gaming consoles before now. For the time being these services are exclusive to Sony gaming and mobile products, namely the Playstation 3, the Playstation 4, and Xperia line of mobile devices. The ability to stream music from the service while playing games is available on the Playstation 4 but has not been announced as being available on the Playstation 3. Sony has yet to comment on whether or not the Spotify application will be available on the Playstation Vita, Sony’s flagship handheld gaming system. Microsoft currently maintains their own music streaming service built similarly to Spotify, known as Xbox Music. It has not been announced whether there are plans in the future to release a Spotify application on gaming systems that aren’t owned by Sony.

Apple's next-generation iPhone will reportedly include a chip manufactured by its rival Samsung. According to the recently released Bloomberg report, Samsung is lined up to build the Apple A9 processor chips that will go into the iPhone 6S, rumored to debut later in 2015.\r\n\r\nWhile Apple has long worked with Samsung in the past to power its smartphones, the iPhone-maker recently turned to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., ending Samsung's long-running chip partnership with the company last year. Apple picked TSMC to produce A8 processors for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices. Those agreements came as the relationship between Apple and Samsung soured because of legal disputes dating to 2011. Winning this order from Apple will help the world’s second-largest chipmaker rebound against TSMC.

Google Wallet is Google’s payment platform that allows users to pay for products in partnered stores as well as make online payments while keeping payment information secure. Beth Labson Freeman, a U.S. District Judge, released a statement Wednesday night that Google would face claims in court for breaching contractual user agreements. In total Google will face potential violations of the Federal Stored Communications Act and California consumer protection laws. The Federal Stored Communications Act is in place to limit the disclosure of electronic records by companies holding user data.

The device is fixed in place on the vehicle's windshield in a similar manner to fitting a satnav system. Once attached, it communicates with nearby traffic systems to announce its presence and turn the lights green, requesting priority as the car arrives at the junction. Currently being tested in Newcastle in the UK, it can detect traffic lights located 100 meters away and allows drivers to adjust their speed such that they only ever pass through green lights. For example, a driver may be warned to travel at 28 mph if they wish to pass through the next sets of lights without stopping.
