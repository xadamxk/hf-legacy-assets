This new forum was created for those who want to ask questions and discuss on different forum software such as vBulletin, MyBB and IP.board.  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#ff66ff][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has also added thread prefixes that you can use when creating a new thread. You can read more about that, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4658333]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]HackerCraft is Gone[/b][/color]\nOn January 31st, 2015 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread talking about the HackerCraft awards. In that thread [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made it clear that he will not be granting nor allowing the granting of any HC awards to HF profiles. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] wanted to make that clear so that any plans made are understood without his view on the matter. That thread can be found, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4664522]here[/url]. Unfortunately however, only minutes after posting that thread [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] then posted another thread in the HackerCraft section stating that HC has been ruined, that it's mismanaged and the fact that he's been lied to numerous times regarding how things are being handled. Since [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1205532][color=#EFEFEF][b]Robust[/b][/color][/url] ended up scamming, Peach ended up not seeming capable, and after a whole lot of trouble, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has decided to put an end to HackerCraft. He removed the nameserver, the IP may still work however seeing Peach ([url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1180981][color=#383838][b]Edward Snowden.[/b][/color][/url]) is now closed, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] assumes he'll close the server as well. None of this is good news but it has gone on for long enough and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has had it. He has no plans to re-license the HC brand to anyone else.

How you doing man?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Hello everyone. I'm doing pretty well. A bit sleep deprived, but can't complain too much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Are there any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Sure. I'd really like to give shoutouts to all my real friends that I made on HF. Through all the years I've been a member, I made the most friends in the early years when the site was much more tight knit. Those guys would be: Ph1sh, Lasalite, Tank, Sarge, Kn1ght, TRRS, N2h, camgartener, Synny, and pretty much all the malvager guys. Ofc shout to Nightfall and panikgang. I have a few new acquaintences, but really no new friends, no no no.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Been here since day one. How much different is the site now compared to back then?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Well a lot of things have changed. I remember that HF used to be mainly focused on what is now considered DBHA. You could get dumps, logs, any sort of shit you wanted really. I don't recall cc numbers being allowed but they were still posted. The lounge was really enjoyable, there was always witty banter every night. Not the bullshit that plauges it now. People had respect for each other. Now the board has come to be mainly a general discussion site which honestly is out of necessity. I know Omni doesn't like making rules and banning discussions but you have to protect your investments. Postcount, awards, rep, they all used to actually mean something years ago.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Would you say the changes are for the better, with such a rapidly increasing member base?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] I would say they are better for the site. Better for Omni. Better for the future of HF. As for myself and a lot of other members, they're worse. I guess I'd consider most of them a nessecary evil. At it's core, HF is a business first. You have to be about the almighty dollar before a bunch of strangers on the internet. Most of the rules currently are reasonable. It's not hard to stay out of trouble. I mean I don't really care about them one way or another so I act like they don't apply to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I agree with everything you said. So how did you get introduced to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Well it all started back in 2008. Used to be, you didn't have to have an account to view threads and things like that. So I didn't want to register on a hacking forum from a government owned internet connection, and I just lurked mainly and read a lot of informative threads. One day my friend (Envyyy Joker) introduced me to the site, and the first thread I viewed was a compilation of botnet tools, which if I remember was made by iBF back in his mobbin days. When the T-T34m hack happened and shit hit the fan, I ended up registering my current account.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Would you consider yourself to be a hacker? There are some pretty notorious hackers out these days.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] The term \"hacker\" gets thrown around very loosly frequently these days. There is a wide spectrum of hacking that goes on, and most of it is outside of HF and outside of the public eye. I suppose a lot of people would consider activities that I participate in as \"computer hacking\". I have a clicky keyboard, a pirate flag, and a blatant disregard for the feelings of others, so I guess I'm a hacker.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I see, you enjoy the blackhat lifestyle. What's the story behind Panik Gang?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Haha, well, a long time ago I was given an official HF group known as the SCUC, or Scammer Clean Up Crew. It was actually running well until my coleader, Notorious Mental, went apeshit and pretty much ran it into the ground, prompting it to be disbanded, much like the fate recently met by MRT. So all my friends from the crew and some other guys wanted to still be in a group and there was a bunch of idiots that were starting their own wannabe hacker groups in the subforums. Basically as a joke I started a thread and created \"Panik Gang\" as a parody. It blew up like a fucking paki in a bus station and basically before I knew it I had a thousand kids trying to be in my gang. The thread and application were the result of some late night skype calls with some of the malvager guys and everyone just ate it up. Some of the greatest names on HF, including Factor8 are longtime Panik Gang members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Wow. How does it feel to be a gang leader on the dark side?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Well I feel  kind of like I did all those years ago, except my ego is now the size of a small country. It feels good to know people have your back. I can literally hit people up that I haven't talked to in over a year and they will commit felonies at the drop of a hat.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'll be sure not to get on your bad side. What else do you do outside of the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Well I like to spend some time on firearm forums, car forums, and social networking like Twitter and Skype. I enjoy chatting with friends online and doing hoodrat shit when needed. Outside of the virtual world, I enjoy working, competitive shooting, attending car shows, spending time with my wife, and mostly just relaxing and trying to appreciate the finer things in life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Oh so you're a gun enthusiast? Do you have a collection or anything like that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I'm an avid shooter, NRA certified instructor, range officer, collector and 2nd amendment/gun rights advocate. As far back as I can remember, I was always interested in firearms.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome. Are you into hunting at all? Or just regular shooting ranges?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Well when I was younger, I liked hunting a bit. Deer, turkey, stuff like that. These days I don't really care for it all that much. I enjoy coyote hunting but that's about it. I appreciate the good that legal game hunting does for wildlife, but it's just not anything that I go out of my way to do. I much prefer a controlled range though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's cool, I have a bunch of friends that used to go hunting. Is there anything else you'd like to say before we conclude this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=96230][color=white][b]Panik:[/b][/color][/url] Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Hey, welcome to this weeks edition of the HF news! We're joined with our very own, 630. What's good dude? Any shout outs before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color] What's good? Well the Chicagoland region has had some crazy snow and for the past 24 hours we've been under a blizzard watch. Pretty tired from snow blowing today, but at least my college got cancelled today so that's one less thing I have to worry about. I'd like to give a big shout out to Cody of 143, Soxy of Mineclash and TheCause.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] To start things off -- who'd you want to win at the super bowl last weekend? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color] I'll be honest after the depressing season the Bears had the last thing I was focused on was football. I personally hate the Patriots and the Seahawks, but I was actually rooting for the Patriots to win. My boss is a huge Seahawks fan along with the rest of her family and I really didn't want to see them pull off a back to back Superbowl win. I think that Wilson is a great guy, but something inside me was not wanting them to win. On the flip side at least it was a fun game to watch, the bar I worked at was packed and it made it a pretty fun night.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] On a different topic, you've quite a bit of posts in the appraisal section. What got you into appraising social mediums? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color] Back when the Appraisals and Pricing section was first introduced I really was drawn to it. I had so many goals back then and two of those goals were to get a sticky and become a moderator of that section. As you can see neither happened. I busted my butt to stay active there and it just grew on me. I guess you could say I get a little satisfaction telling other people roughly how much stuff is worth. I mentioned this once before, but I hate seeing people get scammed or taken advantage of. After my two goals were crushed I made it my own personal goal to inform people because I didn't want to see someone get ripped off or taken advantage of because they were not well informed on the subject or just plain new. I guess you could say what got me into appraising was just general knowledge of different markets. When I first joined Hack Forums I spent a majority of my time selling original items, but have since stopped due to the immaturity of a lot of people and the rapid increase in price that some social media priced at now. Stay Plural recently made a thread about it, I can't stand all the swaglords calling their items \"The best dankest insta ever bro.\" People need to stop putting up such a front and screw on their head straight, but most of these people are in high school and I can't blame them because it's just their age and the need to feel accepted. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What does your alias '630' represent or mean to you?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color]  I really regret choosing the username '630' to be completely honest. Back when I joined Hack Forums I wished I made my username 'Garrett', but it was taken three or so months after I joined. 630 to those who do not know is an area code for the Chicago suburbs. Now 630 means a lot more to me, it's who I am online and I feel like I'm past the point where I can pick a new alias, also the zero username changes means a lot to me.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What else do you do with your free time? Besides being on the internet, of course.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color]  I'm currently a full time student and I'm enrolled at a local college. I also work at a bar as mentioned above four to five nights a week so I really don't have that much free time anymore. My friends have real jobs now so getting together with them is a harder task than it should be, but I do enjoy sitting down at the end of the day with friends having a drink, watching whatever is on the TV, and playing some darts. This year I decided to start golfing, it's a very hard sport, but I love it. I used to golf three or so times a week back in the summer, but now in the winter shooting is my new hobby. I have a few different guns and I do a lot shooting at the gun range. Recently Illinois passed concealed carry and I'm trying to get a free weekend to take the course.\t\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] How'd you even find the forums? Referred by a friend or just pure curiosity on your own?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color] I used to play a lot of Xbox and I guess you could say I got in with the wrong crowd. I used to hang out with Apock back in 2009-2010 and he was the one who told me to join Hack Forums, but the name of the site scared me so I never joined until 2011. I joined because of the gamertag reset because I heard everyone was selling them and people were actually buying. I had a few decent ones and made about $300. I was back in high school with no job and that was a lot of fun so I decided to stay and get more stuff to make money.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  How does the future of HF look like to you? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]:[/b][/color] The future of Hack Forums honestly hasn't looked good since 2011. We've been on a steady decline active members and even now I see my own friends not posting and taking six month vacation bans because they're sick of the community. I don't blame them, the community is awful. If I didn't have so much time invested here I'd be gone, but now I kind of just put up with people and hold my time. If you want to see how bad stuff is go into the Groups and Crews section, nothing but flaming one another. I don't like the fact that every group is invite only or is only run for personal profits. I don't think that the site will die due to neglect by the owner, but the community eating one another. Also I hate this new generation of swagfags, they also make me want to leave.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  I'm glad that you're honest!

I have other than posting my articles I rarely post there because of the conversations that go on. There's an group that run the lounges and troll around with one another and I don't want to get into that stuff, it's annoying and I wish the lounges were more serious. Other than that I have a high amount of respect for the people that complete their articles each week, being a seasoned writer I know how difficult getting stuff in on time can be because life sometimes gets in the way of it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Thanks for taking the time out of your day to do this interview with me man.

In a conversation with Topface's Chief Executive Oficer, Dmitry Filatov, they have stated that the hacker was paid an undiscolsed amount as an award for finding the vulnerability and will be called in the future to help the company with data security. Topface, with 92 million users, had found the hacker through his advertisements in which he offered to sell the data, but hadn't yet sold it by the time executives had contacted him and they were able to prevent him from leaking or selling the information. Most Cyber-Security experts advise not to pay hackers for the return of stolen data since many are dishonest and will accept the ransom without giving the data, however, Filatov agreed not to press charges and stated \"we do not see any reason for him to break it.\" Speculations for the amount of money paid are very far ranging since the information stolen was only email addresses, but it was enough to keep the hacker quiet. Unfortunately, Russian cyber-crime laws are not as strict as those of the U.S. and it seems to almost glorify the illegal theft of data.\n\n[b][color=white]ZeroActcess Reactivates[/color][/b]\nAfter being temporarily disrupted by law enforcement in December of 2013, the P2P (Peer-to-Peer) botnet, named ZeroAccess or Sirefef, has come back into connection. The original function of the botnet was advertising click fraud activities. The software had originally started to begin resurfacing in March and July of 2014, but it was not until late January that the bots started falsely clicking on advertisements. Before ZeroAccess was taken down, it had over 2 million infected users which has since dwindled to a still large, albeit much smaller, 55,000 machines. Since the American FBI and European EC3 were the law enforcement involved in the original takedown, the runners of ZeroAccess are targeting systems outside of these countries. Accounting for under 10% of the total current infections, even if the American/European bots were disabled, the vast majority of the botnet would stay up and perform unhindered. This would allow their click fraud scheme to continue and have each machine act as if it were clicking an advertisement to generate revenue for the attacker. Fortunately, active efforts are being made for an international takedown before it becomes as large of a threat as it had previously become.\n\n[b][color=white]Rise in Malware Data Theft Attacks[/color][/b]\nThe security firm, Darktrace, has reported that a group of hackers have successfully breached the network of a well-known financial service provider, although its name was never released to the press, and has been stealing data continually for the past 6 months. This came as surprise to many individuals and Dave Palmer, the director of Darktrace, has made a statement saying that it is a sign that, even today in our highly technological worlds with advanced firewalls and intrusion detection, our networks are still not sufficiently protected from even the most rudimentary attacks. Darktrace, among many other security firms, has seen a steady rise in attacks that compromise datacenters and intranets and slowly leak data onto the internet. He states that this is because \"people are so confident in [their] firewalls that companies aren't looking inside their networks.\" As someone who regularly works in corporate network environments and with professional datacenters, I can attest to how criticial proper security implementations and regular upkeep is to a system's stability. From the recent Sony scandal, hopefully businesses have learned to have far better security than the storage of company-wide passwords in an unprotected folder labeled \"passwords,\" and to keep up to date with safe encryption algorithms and best practice implementations.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vquwXAz.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91531]ven0m[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler= ][align=left]\n[b][color=white]The GHOST in the Security[/color][/b]\nA new vulnerability was detected this week named GHOST (officially called [url=https://access.redhat.com/articles/1332213]CVE-2015-0235[/url]).

According to their CEO, no charge will be pressed against the attacker since he has not shared the stolen data with anyone and has agreed to comply. Although, the company claims that no sensitive data apart from the email addresses were stolen, they paid the money as a [i]reward[/i] for finding security flaws.\n\n[b][color=white]CryptoTorLocker2015 Decrypted[/color][/b]\nBarely a month has passed of the new year, yet, we faced another ransomware calling itself [i]CryptoTorLocker2015[/i].

He stated that because of this, he never owned an iPhone. British Agency GCHQ was using iPhones UDIDs to track users according to the NSA. Recently Apple has come under fire for security vulnerabilities and back doors in Snowden leaks and it seems they are trying to cover up their imagine. Since OSX 8, iPhones can no longer be gotten into by law enforcement due to encryption options.\n\n[b][color=white]Skype Is of the past, the Future Has MegaChat[/color][/b]\nKim Dotcom has been working on a chat rival to Skype for some time in between lawsuits and jail time. The beta test is finally here. MegaChat's beta service allows video chat, and nothing else at the moment but it is a good start to a free and secure chat alternative to Skype. MegaChat is specifically targeted at people who do not like Skype for it's security holes, and is hopefully going to be easy to use for everyone else so that Skype can die off. MegaChat also offers a bounty to anyone who can find a security vulnerability, unlike Microsoft when it comes to Skype.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DJM3Woh.png[/img]\n[size=xx-small]Image Source: [url=http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/21/megachat/]http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/21/megachat/[/url][/size]\n\n[b][color=white]Google Translator Now Works in Real Time![/color][/b]\n\nPerhaps one of the most exciting things that technology holds for us in the future is breaking the language barrier. Google Translate has begun to do that in real time. Point your camera at anything in another language and you will be shown the display in the language of your choosing instead of the original. Google is able to create this thanks to Word Lens which is bought last year when it purchased the company Quest Visual, a start up gaming company.\n\n[img=300x300]http://img.readitlater.com/i/static1.businessinsider.com/image/54b629165afbd383088b4567-800/afp-google-turns-smartphones-into-real-time-translators/RS/w640.jpg[/img]\n[size=xx-small]Source: [url=http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-google-turns-smartphones-into-real-time-translators-2015-1]http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-google-turns-smartphones-into-real-time-translators-2015-1[/url][/size]\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
