Earlier this week, website owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3955885][b]thread[/b][/url] concerning the matter. He has made a PDF document available for all members to view at [url=http://hackforums.net/Analytics.pdf][b]this link[/b][/url]. A break down of the devices used to visit the forum is also included, boiling down to Windows taking more than three fourths of the entire device usage pie. Surprisingly, iOS follows as a second, Android in third, and the little used Macintosh OS a close fourth. Left in the dust is the usage of Linux machines, at a measly two percent. However, iOS, Android, and OSX are all based off of the Linux kernel. Those wishing to also view language and geography information can do so by visiting a secondary PDF document located [url=http://hackforums.net/Analytics_Lang.pdf][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]New Year's Logo[/b][/color]\nAs Christmas came and went, it is time to put away all the decorations until next year. However, New Year's Eve is soon to come and in relation to that date, site owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has posted a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3956231][b]thread[/b][/url] seeking members to create a banner that will be used for that day. He requests both a banner for the purple and the newer blue themes. Entries can be posted directly on said thread. As can be found by following the links in the first article, Hack Forums received many thousands of unique IP visits daily. If a member wishes to show off their proficiency in the graphical department and have it represent the website on New Year's, this would be the opportunity to do so. \n\n[color=white][b]Hacking Requests Clarification[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has posted a clarification in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=48][b]Requests for Hacking[/b][/url] section stating that per site rules, all marketplace style threads should be located under the Marketplace tab. He reminds users that they may not offer services in  the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=48][b]Requests for Hacking[/b][/url] section, not offer to pay for services provided. As usual per site policy, users found doing so will receive the regular three day \"automatic\" site ban. This announcement should clear up the confusion surrounding the section that is surprisingly popular to new members.\n\n[color=white][b]Infamous Charity - Coats-For-Kids[/b][/color]\nAlthough by now, you've missed the opportunity to donate through Infamous, it is our job to share this story with you.

At the end of the week, they managed to raise over four-thousand dollars in the name of charity. By their hands, hundreds of kids will receive a truly important gift and a few members will have the karma of lining a child with fleece, rather than the greasy pocket of the average [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=600771]Hack Forums Group Owner[/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKJXzuDW3M4XE.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=585389][color=#00AAFF][b]+mK[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=56088][color=#00AAFF][b]tux1[/b][/color][/url] has posted more than 10,000 times.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][color=#EFEFEF][b]'Snorlax[/b][/color][/url] has reached 2,000 reputation points and 1,000 prestige.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Repfucks[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=829359][color=#00AAFF][b]ᴀpex[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Active Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1134079][color=black][b]Kangaroo‎‎[/b][/color][/url] was banned for trolling.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1844212][color=black][b]Bull™[/b][/color][/url] was banned for account sharing.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=491392][color=black][b]Avaswift[/b][/color][/url] was banned for ub3r junk abuse.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1693297][color=black][b].Alerion[/b][/color][/url] was banned for low quality posting.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=766855][color=black][b]Baghead [/b][/color][/url] was banned for impersonating members.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1837949][color=black][b]Angry Grаndpa[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1028345][color=black][b]Ass Man[/b][/color][/url] were banned for assisting a ban evader.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Expired Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][color=#EFEFEF][b]Wallet[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1700066][color=#EFEFEF][b]Gаry[/b][/color][/url] was banned for asking for donations.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=103609][color=EFEFEF][b]Parazyd[/b][/color][/url] was banned for low quality posting.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Vacations[/b][/color]\n[list][list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=871484][color=black][b]Google[/b][/color][/url] took a lengthy ban.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1339278][color=black][b]Paragοn[/b][/color][/url] needed a little away time.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1582798][color=black][b]Jesse Pinkman[/b][/color][/url] took a short time off.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=891000][color=black][b]Xerucide[/b][/color][/url] requested a short vacation ban.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=black][b]Saturday[/b][/color][/url] took a short vacation ban.

Today we're interviewing Bay. Anyone you'd like to out before we start?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] Thanks, I'm glad to be here Clique. I'd like to give shoutouts to Genuine, Conception, Cloudy, Sir, Rage, TheCompany, and my buddy Shane.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] The whole gang, aye? So, tell us more about yourself. What do you do?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, lately I've been conditioning for the Track season. I'm a junior in highschool and I run Track as well as Cross Country. I enjoy playing Halo 3 in my spare time, and I also have been into Graphics lately.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Think that Baghead has a pretty good guide for that kinda' stuff. Have an idear of what you want to do once you're out of h/s?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, I've been talking to Baghead a lot and asking for tips and all of that. He's a pretty chill guy. Once I'm out of highschool I intend to attend a college in Illinois near Chicago. I will probably major in Business and/or Graphic Design. I want to own my own business for sure though, probably a clothing line.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True. Fashion/clothing is a pretty competitive scene. Best of luck on that type of stuff.  Did you register on the site for Hacking, or something else?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] Well, I used to be big into Social Engineering. That's one of the main reasons I joined. Last summer, the FBI came to my house and interrogated me, so I won't be doing any blackhat activity for the rest of my life. On the other hand, I did spend a lot of time in the Gaming sections of Hackforums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] So, you actually got caught doing that kinda stuff? Intense. Think you'll ever move onto the new consoles? Or are you sticking around w/H3 and all that good stuff.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] I might stick with H3 for awhile. If not I'd get the Xbox One. I hear the graphics are amazing.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Yuh, it's pretty dang cool man. Coming from experience here. What made you stick on the site? Rather than just leaving.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] To be honest, at first it was my RDP sales. I became really inactive for a few months and all I did was sell RDPs and look at threads, without posting. Now, I miss having tons of people to talk to daily, so I've just been sticking around because of the great community.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Is your shop still up, though? I remember it being around. Also, you have any plans to do something on the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] No, my shop is not open anymore. My plans right now are to just get active and maybe get into some new groups. Hopefully I can make myself known in the Graphics section. It's just going to take some time.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True. Think you'd love to be in that FlyByNight program. What do you do? Tagging or just anything you want?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, I'd be lucky to get into that program. I used to do a lot of tagging. Now I think I am going to move more towards illustration and vectoring. Tagging will still always be one of my favorite things to do when it comes to graphics.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] PYeah man! Best of luck. How'd you discover HackForums? Think that you'd become who you are today here?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] The story of how I discovered Hackforums is pretty weird. My friend on Xbox told me to sign onto his account to check if he had any posts on his thread. He told me I should join, and I didn't want to. A few months later, I thought back to it and decided that it wouldn't hurt to try it out. I had no clue that I would come to be so successful on this forum. It just happened. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Yeah, forreal man. Anyways. We're coming to an end of this interview. Anything you'd like to say before we're finished?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=434812]Bay[/url]:[/b][/color] I'd like to say thanks for having me. I'd also like to wish everyone a Happy New Years.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070]#Thunder[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Thanks for checking out this weeks HF News. Today I'm here with #Thunder. How are ya today #Thunder? Would you like give any shoutouts before we begin? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] Sure I'll give out some shoutouts:\n[list]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1374951][b]Evangelist[/b][/url] - You've been a chill member since I was a l33t.  Always been there for me for emotional support when needed.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1548093][b]Ηaze[/b][/url] - Our hilarious Skype conversations that we have.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b]Tibit[/b][/url] - You've been a noob, and will always be one champ.\n[/list]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome, so how did you come across Hack Forums? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] I originally joined HackForums because I heard about the Social Engineering subforum. Unfortunately, the subforum was closed because of the fraudulent activity that was going on in that section. When the subforum was pruned by Omni I left the forum and came back to the community about a year and a half ago.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I see, so what keeps you coming back everyday?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] I honestly came back for no real reason. I just decided one day to go back to the forum. But why do I come back though? Because I can chat with some people I met on the forum and to assist others in the Computing forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So do you have any plans for your future here at HF? Any projects or releases coming up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] My future plans would continue serving the individuals in the Computing subforum. For projects and such, I really do not have any mind.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's really good to hear. So which area in the computing section do you frequent most?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] The Android Operating System section is the one I really enjoy the most. But my second most favorite section would have to be the White Hat Help section. Both of those are my all-time favorite.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's cool, I imagine the WHH section is extremely active. So if you think HF could improve on one thing, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] WHH is a pretty active. If I were to change one thing, it would be the post quality. One of my pet peeves in that section is the users who give a link to Google, and expect he or she to escalate their own issue they made a thread about.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah posts like that are extremely annoying. So this is a little random but which HF theme are you using?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] I'm not using one of the default HF themes. I am using the following theme: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3908185][b]Black Glossy Theme[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=585389]+mK[/url]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That looks like a pretty rad theme. I personally use modern blue, but anything is better than the old school theme IMO. So I noticed you're an Empire member. How's that going? How long have you been in that group for and are you enjoying it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] It's doing pretty good. I've been in the group for almost a year now. The group recently got a huge new wave of members. So far it's been doing fine though. Really been enjoying the experience and the activity within the group!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What group have you enjoyed being apart of the most and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] It would have to be The Empire. I've a few groups throughout my time on HF but The Empire is what I have enjoyed the most. I just enjoy The Empire because of the community behind it. It's always active and never gets boring!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] There are a lot of cool people I've met from The Empire that's for sure. Well I'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any final thoughts you'd like to share, now's the time!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1021070][color=white][b]#Thunder[/b][/color][/url] I really have not much else to say. :P[/spoiler]",

That means free festive items, events and a lot of jolly fun, so even though Christmas might seem over, in the gaming world it is still going. RoosterTeeth have made a list of a few of the games making events and the list goes as following: Holiday-themed DLC and events to enjoy in Payday 2, Borderlands 2, Saints Row IV, Dota 2, League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, GTA Online, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf.\nAdditional Events:\nMinecraft PC has reskinned giftwrapped chests,\nGuild Wars 2 is running a holiday event,\nSteam is offering Left 4 Dead 2 (PC) free,\nStar Trek Online has a winter event,\nSo does Runescape,\nTerraria has some extra festive enemies,\nStarbound (beta) has bonus holiday items,\nSmite has 3 holiday skins,\nLord of the Rings Online has a Yule Festival,\nStar Wars: The Old Republic is running an annual event,\nNeverwinter is holding a festival.\n\n[color=white][b]Nintendo Removes Pokemon Bank In Japan[/b][/color]\nShort after the release of the Pokemon bank in Japan, Nintendo was forced to remove the service from the Nintendo E shop because the pressure on this service was too big. Following this, Nintendo closed down the entire Nintendo Network, most likely in an attempt to upgrade and prepare the service for when the Pokemon Bank will be re-added to the Japanese service. This could also very well mean that there will be a delay on when the service is brought to the US, simply because the servers are not ready.\n\n[color=white][b]Free Left 4 Dead 2![/b][/color]\nTo top off all the amazing deals steam has and still are featuring in the Steam Store, on Christmas Day they presented users with a little gift. All users could pick up a free copy of the well known title L4D2. The offer however was only valid during the one day and is now no longer in action. The deal caused Steam servers to experience trouble and a lot of users had problems receiving the game due to heavy demand. On a side note, it has been a great year for Steam which only seems to grow bigger for each day. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nA look at the GTA5 Christmas DLC!

In second place, then, PatoXD won a $100 J!NX voucher and some signed swag with his [url=https://d1y0oqfyli6x95.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gingerbread.png]gingerbread man creeper[/url]. Lastly, Taco_Thief won a $50 J!NX voucher and some signed swag with his [url=https://d1y0oqfyli6x95.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Taco.png]Christmas ninja[/url]. Overall, there were some pretty unique applicants and attempts.\n\n[color=white][b]MindCrack UHC Season 13[/b][/color]\nTraditionally, the Mindcrackers have started their new season of their four-man-team ultra hardcore survival. In four teams of four, the goal is to survive the longest (alongside PVP'ing other teams) and ultimately win. Not only are famous Youtubers partaking in the traditional event, but as are popular Minecraft developers such as Dinnerbone himself. The event brings in a large audience and it's likely very easily found as most (or all) of the players post each game to their Youtube channels.\n\n[b][color=white]Sorry Wii U-- No Minecraft for U[/color][/b]\nAfter releasing Minecraft on the PS3, many questions had risen regarding the release of it on the Wii U-- after all, it was on two other leading consoles. That being said, Notch, one of Minecraft's lead developers, had to respond. Doing so, he posted [url=https://twitter.com/notch/status/416451885650821120]a Tweet[/url] saddening many in that the Wii U won't be seeing Minecraft any time soon. Many were confused and had misconceived making Notch look like a bad guy. Thereafter, [url=https://twitter.com/notch/status/416452962450300928]another Tweet[/url] had to be made clearing up the issue; Notch \"<3's Nintendo.\"\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nThe server's news has still been further postponed due to a lack of activity. Omniscient has stated that he has plans for the near future, though, so don't be discouraged as the HackerCraft news will definitely see another day.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]Mindcrack[/color][/b]\nThough the server isn't public, it definitely deserves some recognition. All (or most) of its players put tons of effort into making builds on the server pleasing in both an aesthetic and functional sense. Doing so, they produce countless Youtube videos with their entertaining endeavors day after day. Tune into some of their videos by searching \"Mindcrack\" on Youtube.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbk3er9WdlWUGL.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Second Bomb Hits Russia[/b][/color]\nThis past week in Russia, another bombing has occurred. Fourteen innocent civilians have been killed and there have been investigations going on ever since. As the winter Olympics slowly approach, Russia needs to focus on their security and make sure something like this doesn't occur again. The first bombing in Volograd's train station killed 17 people and wounded 35. Vladmir Markin, who has shared as much as he could, stated that the attacks were by terrorists. The bombing that occurred yesterday was caused by a suicide bomber, and it has been said that this bombing was too. These two bombings in the past few days have brought a lot of grief towards Russia. Various footage has been released as well. Hopefully the security will be up to par, and everyone will be safe.\n\n[color=white][b]Attack on German Ambassador[/b][/color]\nShots have been fired on the German Ambassador in Athens, Greece. Reports have been given that 60 rounds from an AK47 were fired into the gate of the area he was in. Thankfully, no one was hurt. The rapid growth of an anti-German group has spread throughout Greece. Most of the people without jobs are somehow blaming it on the Germans. Germany is currently the biggest help towards Greece; they have contributed 240 billion euros, helping to save Greece from bankruptcy. As of now, no one has been caught and no one is sharing what they know about the people who did it.\n\n[color=white][b]China Tells Communist Party Officials to Stop Smoking in Public[/b][/color]\nAs of now, communist officials are not allowed to smoke in public places in China. Being the place with the highest population, China is currently #1 for largest consumer of tobacco. Beijing made a pledge way back in 2008 to ban all smoking in public places, but the rules have been bent, and no one follows them. Why is the government not taking action? Cigarettes (expensive ones) can be given as gifts, as can be a huge part of most people's lives. Instead of taking action and banning it, China taxed them even more. Major cities have tried enforcing rules on banning it, but as said above, people will continue doing it because there is no punishment taking place.\n\n[color=white][b]Japan's Homeless Recruited to Clean Up Fukushima [/b][/color]\nThree years ago, an earthquake and tsunami hit the east coast of Japan. Not only did it destroy various different cities, but it set off meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant. Today, new jobs have sparked up for homeless people around Japan, the biggest clean up occurred for such a horrible disaster. This has happened because there has been a lack of workers and motivation to actually get the nuclear plant going. According to police accounts, back in October, various different homeless people were rounded up and paid minimum wage to clean up trash and other waste around the city. Japan doesn't want to ask questions concerning this. One person who recruits others did state this: \"I don't ask questions; that's not my job. I just find people and send them to work.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbpto8022b2C4P.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Some Bad News for New Years[/color][/b]\nAccording to a [url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/30/tech/web/netflix-streaming-purge/index.html]post on Reddit[/url], Netflix has seized the ability to stream not only a large list of movies, but additionally plenty of TV shows as well. Although only an unconfirmed source posted the list, it's been made clear that many of the listed TV shows and movies expire on Wednesday when searched on Netflix. It's not yet mentioned why they've decided upon this, but they may have something in mind for the New Year.\n\n[b][color=white]Target Confirms PIN Data Was Compromised[/b][/color]\nAfter their recent security breach endeavor regarding credit and debit cards, it's now been made clear that in addition to the aforementioned, personal identification number (PIN) data has been at stake as well. Though the data was stolen, Target assures users that it was \"safe and secure\" due to its encryption methods. Not only are such measures taken, but in order to decrypt the data, a decryption key is needed as well. \n\n[b][color=white]Xbox One and Playstation 4 in Short Supply for Holiday Season[/color][/b]\nDue to a long wait for a new console, Microsoft and Sony have been having a hard time keeping their next-gen consoles on the shelves. In addition, a short a supply of their new hardware might also lead to such, but the constant expectation of something new certainly contributed. Nevertheless, it's very safe to say that most retail stores have and will be sold out of the next-gen consoles all throughout the holiday season.\n\n[b][color=white]A $4 Million Cut on Tim Cook's Salary[/color][/b]\nDue to a recent drop in stock prices, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, took a seemingly mandatory dock in his pay. According to Apple's compensation committee, not too heavy of a burden was wanted to be left on Cook, but it had to be done. Additionally, only less-than-half was needed-- making it not so bad for him. After a filing made by Apple, a claim was made that Tim Cook had a \"strong desire to set a leadership example in the area of CEO compensation and governance,\" hence his decision.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jR3lvB4HTGn9G.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Justin Bieber \"Retiring\". [/b][/color]\nNoticed many threads on HF regarding this, but guess what? It's likely to be a hoax. A publicity stunt for his upcoming new documentary (his third to date) \"Believe\" which hit theaters on the 25th. The Biebs spent his time retweeting tweets regarding the movie and not to forget he also has a new album coming out soon. Get this: Bieber's excuse for retiring was because too many \"lies\" from the media and also how being a \"belieber\" is a lifestyle. \n\n[b][color=white]Queen Beyonce #1.[/color][/b]\nBeyoncé remains at #1 on Billboard charts, barely missing the platinum mark (according to MTV). Almost hitting a million in sales with her self titled album \"Beyoncé\". Only two other albums have gone platinum in the span of two weeks in 2013: Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience. Beyonce was close, but did not hit it. Currently she has had 991,000 copies sold.\n\n[b][color=white]Katy Perry Crowned Twitter Queen Of 2013.[/color][/b]\nKaty Perry beat Lady Gaga and her monsters for most retweets, mentions, and followers. Perry gained more Twitter followers than any artist in any genre in 2013, according to Twitter. She added 15 million followers this year alone, bringing her total to just over 48 million. Close behind her is Justin Bieber, who gained gained 13.8 million new friends this year. Though she only gained 7.6 million new followers this year, Lady Gaga and her 40.8 million little digital monsters held on strong, making her the third most-followed artist.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbqvv2o0WFZf18.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nHappy New Year, ya cunts.\nNow I'ma go catch some shut-eye.\nI need my beauty sleep.",
