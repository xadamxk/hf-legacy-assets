This section will grow over time to more things, but for now we are just going to be doing Song of the week. We are open to what more we could bring to the section from your suggestions, but as a start, we feel adding the song of the week will be a great start for the section and lead the way forward for more things in the future.\n\nNow we know some of you may question what the song of the week is all about, and we have thought of what a great answer. We feel like the song of the week should be a meaningful song that goes deeper than just general music and has meaning to it all. Granted, we may have a little fun with it sometimes. (Yes, we will have a Halloween version and Christmas version too.) But we want to keep it at a level where we have found the song has a true message behind it all and not just something that everyone will just see as another song that is just a bit catchy or got a good few beats to it. We hope this helps those with that question and if anyone has anything that they wish to ask, please feel free to add them below. We are more than happy to give the reason behind it.\n\nThis weeks Song Of The Week:\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI0wUoCLnLk[/video]\n\n[hr]\n\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/contests.png[/img]\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=3929084]\n\n[u][b][size=large][color=#ffffff][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6310206]\n$100 Crypto Contest - Celebrating my entrance to Quantum[/url] By [mention=5655318] [/color][/size][/b][/u]\n\nA new contest has been created this week by [mention=5655318] He is celebrating his entrance to the new group Quantum by giving away $100.

The flaws—all of which are rated critical—can be chained to enable remote code execution (RCE) by allowing attackers to install additional plugins without proper authorization.\n\nWordPress security vendor Wordfence reported blocking roughly 8.7 million attack attempts aimed at its customers during a concentrated two-day window (October 8–9).\n\nThe operation leverages three distinct vulnerabilities tracked as [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-9234[/color], [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-9707[/color], and [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-11972[/color], each carrying a CVSS score of 9.8.\n\n[color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-9234[/color] is an unauthenticated flaw in a REST endpoint of the GutenKit plugin (≈40k installs) that permits installing arbitrary plugins without credentials.\n\n[color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-9707[/color] and [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-11972[/color] are missing-authorization issues in the themehunk-import REST endpoint of the Hunk Companion plugin (≈8k installs) that likewise allow arbitrary plugin installation.\n\nAn attacker who can exploit these weaknesses (or chain them with other privileges) may introduce an additional backdoored plugin that grants remote code execution on the host.\n\nAffected versions / fixes: [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-9234[/color] impacts GutenKit ≤ 2.1.0. [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-9707[/color] affects Hunk Companion ≤ 1.8.4; [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2024-11972[/color] affects Hunk Companion ≤ 1.8.5. Patches were released (GutenKit 2.1.1 in Oct 2024; Hunk Companion 1.9.0 in Dec 2024), but many sites remain unpatched.\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: BleepingComputer.\n\n[color=#2ECC40][b]Emergency Windows Server updates fix WSUS RCE with public PoC[/b][/color]\n\nMicrosoft pushed out-of-band updates to remediate a critical RCE vulnerability in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), after proof-of-concept exploit code became public.\n\nWSUS, the on-premises update-management component, is only vulnerable when the WSUS Server Role is enabled (it is not enabled by default).\n\nTracked as [color=#2ECC40]CVE-2025-59287[/color], the flaw enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to trigger unsafe object deserialization in a legacy serialization path, resulting in code execution as SYSTEM. The attack vector is low complexity and requires no user interaction, raising wormability concerns between WSUS instances.\n\nMicrosoft emphasized that servers without the WSUS role are not affected, and that enabling the role without applying the fix will expose the host.\n\nMicrosoft published updates for all impacted Windows Server releases and urged immediate installation, including (selection): Windows Server 2025 (KB5070881), 23H2 (KB5070879), 2022 (KB5070884), 2019 (KB5070883), 2016 (KB5070882), 2012 R2 (KB5070886), and 2012 (KB5070887).\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: BleepingComputer.\n\n[color=#2ECC40][b]Former cyber exec charged over sale of secrets to Russia[/b][/color]\n\nU.S. federal prosecutors have indicted a former general manager in the cyber division of defense contractor L3Harris (Trenchant) on allegations of selling trade secrets to a buyer in the Russian Federation for roughly $1.3 million.\n\nThe indictment states the defendant, Peter Williams, stole seven trade secrets belonging to two unnamed companies between April 2022 and June 2025 and knowingly intended them for sale outside the United States.\n\nCourt filings do not detail the exact nature of the secrets. Williams held senior roles at Trenchant, a unit involved in developing offensive cyber capabilities.\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: The Register.\n\n[color=#2ECC40][b]Microsoft blocks downloaded file previews to prevent NTLM hash leaks[/b][/color]\n\nAs part of October 2025 Patch Tuesday, Microsoft disabled preview rendering for files marked with the Mark of the Web (MotW), a Windows flag applied to files downloaded via browsers or received as attachments.\n\nMotW signals potentially unsafe content and already restricts risky behaviors (for example, disabling macros in Office documents). The new change prevents previewing such files, mitigating a flaw that could leak NTLM hashes during preview operations. Exfiltrated NTLM hashes can be brute-forced to recover credentials or abused in relay attacks.\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: Microsoft advisory / reporting.\n\n[color=#2ECC40][b]RedTiger — open-source Python red-team tool observed in the wild targeting gamers and Discord[/b][/color]\n\nRedTiger is an open-source Python red-team toolkit released in 2024 that bundles reconnaissance, network scanning, phishing toolkits, a Discord-focused module, and an infostealer. While intended for red-team and security research use, components have been observed reused by malicious actors.\n\nRecent telemetry highlights multiple RedTiger-derived payloads in circulation, with the infostealer component specifically targeting gaming communities and Discord accounts—an active trend described in multiple analysis posts this month.\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: Netskope blog.\n\n[color=#2ECC40][b]AI misclassification leads to armed handcuffing of teenager in U.S. school incident[/b][/color]\n\nA Baltimore teenager was detained by heavily armed police after an AI system mistakenly flagged a crisps packet as a firearm. The student, 16-year-old Taki Allen, said officers arrived in force and ordered him onto the ground.\n\nBaltimore County Police stated officers responded proportionally based on the information they were given. According to reports, human reviewers had dismissed the AI alert, but a school principal did not see the cleared alert and escalated the situation to the safety team, which called police.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for reviewing procedures around AI-driven monitoring at schools. The student reported he had an empty Doritos packet in his pocket after football practice; police arrived approximately 20 minutes later.\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: BBC.\n\n[color=#2ECC40][b]MuddyWater (Iranian actor) deploys Phoenix backdoor against >100 government targets[/b][/color]\n\nThe threat actor known as MuddyWater (aliases: Static Kitten, Mercury, Seedworm) executed a phishing campaign beginning August 19 that deployed Phoenix backdoor v4 across more than 100 government and diplomatic entities, primarily in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nResearchers from Group-IB report the campaign used a compromised [censored] account to originate phishing emails. On August 24 the attacker apparently disabled its server-side C2 component—suggesting a shift to alternate tooling or a new stage of operations. Most observed targets were embassies, foreign affairs ministries, consulates, and similar diplomatic missions.\n\n[color=#18FFFF]Source[/color]: BleepingComputer.\n\n[size=x-large][b][u]This week’s notable critical CVEs and POCs[/u][/b][/size]\n\n[b][color=#2ECC40]CVE-2025-24813 — Apache Tomcat path equivalence / partial PUT RCE ([color=#E82A1F]PoC [/color]repos updated this week)\n[/color][/b]\nA path-equivalence / partial-PUT handling issue in Apache Tomcat that lets an attacker write or replace files (including uploading crafted serialized data) leading to unsafe deserialization and RCE under certain configurations. Several PoC repositories and exploit scripts have been published or refreshed recently.\n[b]\n[color=#2ECC40]CVE-2025-30208 — Vite dev server /@fs/ arbitrary file read ([color=#FF4136]PoC [/color]scripts available)\n[/color][/b]\nA path traversal / @fs bypass in Vite dev server that allows arbitrary file reads via crafted query strings (e.g., ?raw?? trick).
