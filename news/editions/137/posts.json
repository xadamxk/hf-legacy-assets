It looks like we got a lot of you with the last edition of the news, though, we didn't expect the amount of flame we received towards the Writ3rs, especially the News Team. A lot of people didn't really see it as a joke and started to criticize our work. All jokes aside, we aren't going anywhere; not for a long time at least. We enjoy what we do, and we do it all for fun. We don't get anything in return for publishing our articles in the HF news each and every week. \n\nOfficial Empire group owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b]Tibit[/b][/url] also pulled an April Fools joke. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b]Tibit[/b][/url] claimed that they were closing and selling The Empire to former staff member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=661940][color=#0066FF][b]bugga[/b][/color][/url]. It looks like this was done because a lot of people didn't like how [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=661940][color=#0066FF][b]bugga[/b][/color][/url] moderated the forum, so they thought it would be a great April Fools prank. You may read the official thread located here: [url]http://bit.ly/ZEJaTq[/url].\n\nOfficial group Graphics Masters also pulled quite an amusing Aprils Fools prank. They posted a wall of graphics that were meant to look terrible. The \"Graphics Masters | Show Case can be found here: [url]http://bit.ly/Y3G4sY[/url]. \n\nSite owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] had also pulled a prank. There was a green notification in the header of Hack Forums which guided people to read their PMs. The PM was allegedly sent out from the Hack Forums server, and took awhile for people to receive as there were so many members to send it to. A lot of people didn't receive it and this still remains a mystery. The official thread posted by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] may be read here: [url]http://bit.ly/10BNrdK[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]All YouTube Awards Granted[/b][/color]\nSite owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has announced that all YouTube awards have finally now been granted. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also said, [i]\"If you have not gotten the award please PM me the original data. But I must see the upload date for the video between Dec 28, 2012 and Jan 1, 2013. Otherwise you will be denied the award.\"[/i]. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] claimed he gave out around 350 YouTube awards which took hours upon hours of work. He doesn't think he will ever do something like this again. It took him about three months to finish all of the awards, but he did it, so we can be thankful he didn't throw it under the rug.

As most of us know, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1232842][b]#Skyline[/b][/url] spends a lot of time around Remote Administration Tools. A reporter from one of the most popular news sources, The Sydney Morning Herald, asked [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1232842][b]#Skyline[/b][/url] if he would like to be interviewed on Remote Administration Tools, and he agreed to do so. The reporter did an interview over Skype, which to our knowledge was the method of communication. The article is titled [i]\"How hackers can switch on your webcam and control your computer\".[/i].

They also claimed they released information about stressers, and took a lot of products on Hack Forums down with the excuse that these tools were being overly abused by members. They said, [i]\"We have targeted several HF products, and released information as to the location of these so called 'stressers'. These are tools which are constantly being abused.\"[/i] Needless to say, they got a lot of people and claimed they targeted sticky products on the marketplace. Unfortunately it being April 1st, a lot of people had a feeling that was a troll.

Hey bud! Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b]D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] I'm honored to be interviewed; I did it for so long. Shoutouts... All members of InFaMoUs, The Alliance, Red Lions and the Writers. Ethereal for being my compatriot with the Wiki. xadamxk for being a badass in training. Mr. Snow for being one of the few sensible people who exercises his freedom of speech. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Sorry, I don't think I can continue the interview with someone who shouts out xadamxk D:\nJust kidding!\nHow are you doing today, D3xus? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Doing good. Setting up my Raspberry Pi computer for coding and Linux. My dad got it for me for about $20 and it's amazing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Raspberry Pis are so awesome for the price. Coding, eh? What language are you looking to code in? And what Linux distro are you using? Coming from a macphag here, going back to a non-unix OS would just be weird :P\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] I'm using Raspbian. I'm learning to code in C++ and Java so I can take the AP Computer Science exam... it would look great on a college resume.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Ooh, so you're in high school right now? You'll have to forgive me, I'm not overly familiar with the American education system 😝 Are you looking to do Comp sci in college?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] I'm hoping to pursue a degree in Computer Science, yeah. There are a lot of career opportunities and it is one of the fastest growing industries. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I completely agree. \nWhat do you think it is about technology that captivates people so much?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] People love how it can do so many things in a small amount of space or computer power. People are mesmerized by it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Are you at all afraid about this potential that's still being unlocked? I mean, could technology take us [i]too[/i] far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure some [s]genius[/s] idiot will do something to fuck humanity up. Just a hunch.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Well, that's just inevitable, I suppose 😝 Is there any upcoming technology that you're excited about?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url]  I suppose I am looking forward to when humanity builds self constructive robots. They can build and program themselves and outnumber humans in a short amount of time. It's scary but I'm curious to see what will happen. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Haha, exactly. So, what was it that first brought you to HF? :)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] For the longest time, I'd googled extremely naive, but at the time awesome, things for hacking or gaming things. How to hack websites. Boot people off of Xbox Live. Make lots of money. The simple things. I kept coming to HF, but I couldn't view any threads because of the guest permissions. I procrastinated joining, but one day gave up and decided to join. I then lost sight of why I came and stuck around the iDevice forum for god knows how long.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Hmm. I don't think I should ask you this, but [b]why[/b] iOS over Android? 😝\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] At the moment it's a tie. Android is much more user friendly and has a lot of different things that iOS doesn't have; Apple just seems to copy everything from jailbreak tweak developers and other companies and then cry about it whenever someone else steals their stuff.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Haha! I personally think that, although iOS is a great OS, there's nothing that makes it special. In my mind, at least. I think it needs to be freshened up a bit 😝\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] There are some good and bad things about iOS. Overall, it's a tie. They both have great features and things to compete with one another so they kinda even out in the end.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you, good sir <3 Any last words before we go our separate ways?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=white][b] D3xus:[/b][/color][/url] Never look back unless you plan on going that way.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152]Vazity[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to your first interview, Vazity! Shall we start with your shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] Yes! I want to throw a shoutout for my friends Froggy, Insidious and Razmus! I hope they've been enjoying their week on HF! 🙂\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] How did you find HF in the first place? Did you expect it to be as important to you as it is today?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] I originally visited Hack Forums, for the first time in 2008. Decided not to register though. It was after my friend hacked some Habbo Packets, so he could duplicate the russian samovar and dragon eggs (purple, green eggy things). That's how I found it. Didn't really expect HF to be that important to me. Later on I joined a danish hacking forum, figuring out that they where all on HF too, decided to finally register and I haven't regretted it since. I love it!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Have you learned anything while browsing the forums? If yes, what exactly?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] I've learnt a lot about the subject hacking to be honest, and about malware removal. HF is one of the best resources on the web I think to be honest, there's so much to be learnt. Since I joined HF, I've been become a lot more knowledgeable on hacking, and the different types of malware and such. Also expanded my webprogramming knowledge and actually learnt a few other languages from HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] What do you think about HF as a community?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] It's a great community, though there are a few bad people here and there, but overall I think it's good!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I see you're hosting a big giveaway thread. What inspired you to make it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url]  I was in such a good mood, decided to throw a big donation, and decided to celebrate my birthday in a way also being nice to other people, to be honest I am really happy these days so I thought I would give back the favor and make people in a good mood too!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I also see that you're a member of the Red Lions. Do you aim to be in any other groups?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] Well I have been looking out for The Empire too, many of my friends are a part of it and told me it's amazing, that's the only one for the moment. 🙂 Though I also feel fine being a part of RL as the only group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] That's damn right! The Empire is amazing! 🙂 Do you generate income IRL or online?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] Actually it's not going to be kept a secret. I make every single penny online. I am generating all my income online and have been doing so for a long time. I make it from my website called ViewTube and my 2 pieces of software called YouFlagger and YouComment and I am having great success with it as of the moment.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Very nice! That's some well-deserved income. Do you have any hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] Well I do not really have any in-real-life hobbies for the moment, I run and workout a few times a week together with some friends, and go out having some enjoyable time with friends. Though I have thought about doing starting for some sports in some weeks / months.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for letting me interview you buddy! I wish you best of luck with everything and happy birthday in advance! Do you have any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152][color=white][b]Vazity:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you Connected. I just wanna say it's fantastic to be apart of such a community, and thank you for interviewing me it's been fun! See everybody around on the forums! 🙂\n[/spoiler]",

The fake change log which was released on Mojang's website is huge, with ridiculous changes such as 'ultra realistic 4D graphics' and 'turn based PVP' which can only be fought with captured monsters. Although this joke was ridiculously overdone, many Minecrafters fell for it; although this might be due to the fact that much of the Minecraft community is under twelve years old. To read more about [i]Minecraft 2.0[/i], click [url=http://mojang.com/2013/04/its-finally-coming-minecraft-2-0/]here[/url]. \n\n[b][color=white]Griefing Section: New Moderator and Crackdown on Trolling[/color][/b]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] recently posted a thread titled \"[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3360673]LQP Crackdown on Trolling[/url]\" in which he addressed the huge amount of trolls in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=203]griefing section[/url]. He said the griefing section was no place for LQP and that staff would ban anyone trolling in that section for a week without warning. In hopes of reducing the amount of trolls and increasing the quality of posts, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=956054]Emylbus[/url] was promoted to moderator of the griefing section. When asked about the position, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=956054]Emylbus[/url] said, [i]\"I've only been in the position for a few days, but I think people would agree that the extra attention of a second dedicated moderator has only improved the section and hopefully has lessened the work for the staff. I do find myself handling a lot of trolls (this is the griefing section after all and that's what we specialize in) and low quality posters, however I feel that I have been saved the worst of it due to the massive crackdown Omni led on the section a few days before I was promoted.\" [/i] It seems as if our new moderator along with [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] statement have drastically increased the quality in the griefing section. \n\n[b][color=#87CEEB]Planet Beacon:[/color][color=white] Chadlana falls apart[/color][/b] \nChadlana, which was previously one of the biggest and most prominent factions on Planet Beacon, was recently disbanded. This all happened in a matter of minutes over a dispute between [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=661940]bugga[/url] and another member. Tozza (otherwise known as Phytrix), who was a very active player on HackerCraft and the owner of [i]Wolves[/i], recently rose from the dead and decided to log in to Planet Beacon. Phytrix was added to Chadlana as well as a Skype call with various Chadlana members; because of her history with Phytrix, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=661940]bugga[/url] wasn't happy. She left Chadlana along with [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=570186]TheHackersLove[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066]Judge Dredd[/url]. The trio joined Rogue, leaving Chadlana disbanded. The rest of Chadlana split apart, with most members joining either Conspiracy or TheCompany. \n\n[align=center][b][color=#FFA500]Featured Server of the Week:[/color][color=white] ScavengerCraft![/color][/b]\nThis week's featured server is Scavenger Craft!

Microsoft's upcoming Xbox is back in the spotlight with fresh \"always-online\" drama. Sources claim that the next-generation console will require an internet connection to boot-up. A source contacted Kotaku explaining that if the connection goes offline for more than three minutes, any game or application will be suspended, which means you may be greeted with the Xbox dashboard. \"Unless something has changed recently, Durango consumer units must have an active internet connection to be used,\" the source said. After this information shed light, Microsoft Studios creative director Adam Orth argued against the drama with \"always-on\" internet connection. Adam on his personal Twitter account account (which was recently set to private after the drama), argued \"sorry, I don't get the drama around having an 'always on' console. Every device now is 'always on'. That's the world we live in. #dealwithit\". \"Did you learn nothing from Diablo III or SimCity? You know some people's internet goes out right? Deal with it is a sh***y reason,\" replied BioWare gameplay designer Manveer Heir. \"Electricity goes out too,\" said Orth in response. \"The mobile reception in the area I live in is spotty and unreliable. I will not buy a mobile phone,\" Orth said as a joke. What is going to happen now? No one knows, however the next-generation Xbox should be announced within the next two months, where the \"always-online\" situation will finally be dealt with.\n\nThe spoiler contains images from Adam Orth's Twitter.\n[spoiler=]\n[img]http://puu.sh/2ufuz[/img]\n[img]http://puu.sh/2ufwc[/img]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][b]Battlefield 4 Release Date Revealed...?[/b][/color]\nXbox.com slips up sometimes and reveals things that shouldn't be revealed until a later date. Xbox.com may have revealed the Battlefield 4 release date - it was briefly published before quickly taken down, however these short reveals don't go unnoticed and it seems Battlefield 4 will launch on October 29. It was a post on Xbox.com by games editor, Denny Atkin, where he said \"Only in Battlefield can players go through a building instead of around it, eject from a jet and take out the enemy mid-free fall, or flip a tank.. DICE, a studio of Electronic Arts, announced that Battlefield 4 will arrive on the Xbox 360 on October 29, 2013.\" October 29th is a Tuesday which is the normal day games are released in North America. Gamers are going to get very excited, as this is the same date as the release of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. We are still waiting for EA to \"officially\" announce the release date, however this date seems very promising. \n\n[color=white][b]GTA V Boxart Revealed[/b][/color]\nRockstar have officially revealed the boxart for their highly anticipated game, GTA 5. It was revealed through the official Rockstar Twitter account, however photographs emerged earlier in the week with a GTA-like cover being painted on a brick wall. Rumours started popping up saying that it was the boxart for the game, and those rumours were right. The cover follows the GTA-boxart tradition with black lines and carefully selected images within. Grand Theft Auto is out on September 17th. You can view the official GTA 5 boxart in the spoiler below.\n[spoiler=]\n[img]http://www.xbox360achievements.org/images/news/gtav.jpg[/img]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][b]Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition Hitting Australia[/b][/color]\nAustralia was recently granted the R18+ rating in January, meaning games could have been re-rated to be launched in Australia. Warner Brothers announced the Australian release date for Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition. The game will hit shelves on May 1st for the Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles, and will retail for $39.95 (a very cheap price when compared to other games, normally being launched at $90-$100). Mortal Kombat was rated as R18+ by the Australian Classification Board for \"high-impact violence, blood, and gore\". Mortal Kombat was one of the highest profile games to be banned in Australia by the classification board because it was unsuitable to have the maximum M15+ rating. Australian gamers were stoked that the R18+ rating finally hit, and games that were not allowed are now being accepted.\n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft PC Hits 10 Million Purchases[/b][/color]\nMojang have announced the PC version of Minecraft has now sold over 10 million units. Jeb, the lead designer, tweeted the huge miltestone and he also hinted that horses will be coming in a future update. He tweeted a picture of a horse, which may be a main feature in Minecraft 1.6. The announcement comes after the developer for Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition said the XBLA game has sold more than 6 million copies since launching last year on the Xbox LIVE Marketplace. Mojang also said it will consider porting the game to PlayStation.\n\n[color=white][b]Black Ops II Uprising DLC Confirmed[/b][/color]\nActivision confirmed the upcoming Black Ops II DLC pack, Uprising. The DLC will hit the Xbox LIVE Marketplace on April 18, however it will be available on other platforms later (no date has been announced for other platforms). Uprising will include four new Multiplayer maps (Encore, Magma, Vertigo, and Studio) and a new Zombies mode called \"Mob of the Dead\" where players will be taken to the iconic island prison of Alcatraz in San Francisco, California. Uprising will be FREE for season pass holders or it will be available separately for $15 dollars.\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Xbox 360 Game Releases[/b][/color]\n[b]Apr 16, 2013[/b] - Injustice: Gods Among Us\n[b]Apr 16, 2013[/b] - Painkiller: Hell & Damnation\n[b]Apr 23, 2013[/b] - Dead Island: Riptide\n[b]Apr 23, 2013[/b] - Star Trek\n[b]May 14, 2013[/b] - Metro: Last Light\n[b]May 21, 2013[/b] - Resident Evil: Revelations\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - Fuse\n[b]May 28, 2013[/b] - GRID 2\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nThis week's video comes from the popular MrTechnicalDifficult, where he makes another kid rage on Black Ops II.

The payments are going to take place over the span of a year. Italy's Prime Minister, Mario Monti, said that the debt was \"an unacceptable situation that has been accepted for a long time.\" The decree has been somewhat concerning for the European Union, but the Prime Minister eased worries by saying, \"Economic policy is not changing course, and we don't believe that to revive the economy you have to create more public debt,\" The Italian government has eased their target debt-to-GDP ratio from 1.8 to 2.9. The Economy Minister explained, \"We have to follow a path between the two requirements: to help our economy to recover ... and to maintain budget discipline.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Kansas Enacting Pro-life Bill[/b][/color]\nOn Friday night, both the Kansas strongly republican House of Representatives and Senate house passed a bill that strongly restricts abortion rights. The bill defines the beginning of life at conception. It sets a lot more restrictions such as banning abortions on basis of the fetus' gender and not allowing employees of abortion clinics to give sex education. In the event that the bill is actually enacted, it will be only the 8th state to define life as beginning at conception. Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager of the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute \"It's a statement of intent and it's a pretty strong statement...should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade or should the court come to some different conclusion, the state legislature would be ready, willing and able to ban abortions.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Five Egyptians Die After Religious Clash[/color][/b]\nIn a city near Cairo, a fight between Christians and Muslims left 5 people died and 8 injured. Out of the 5 deaths, 1 of them has been identified a Muslim, and the 4 others were identified as Christian Copts. In the incident, Christian businesses were vandalized, a Christian daycare was set ablaze, and a Muslim's apartment was burned down. The catalyst of the event seems to be Chistian children writing religious text on a Muslim institute wall. Mahmoud Mahmoud al-Alfi, a Muslim, said, \"I saw the kids drawing on the wall after afternoon prayers so I grabbed them and told them to remove what they'd just written.\" The situation turned hotter when another person came onto the scene and started assaulted the children. After that, another man shot one of the boys--killing them.\n\n[color=white][b]China Slaughters Birds[/b][/color]\nIn a poultry-trading area of Shanghai, the Chinese State has killed over 20,000 birds as a result of a odd, deadly strain of the bird flu killing 6 individuals. The government also closed the Huhai agricultural market on Friday morning. The virus has been said to be the  H7N9 avian flu virus. Researchers looking into the virus found a strong similarities between the virus found to be killing individuals and the virus that has been found in the birds.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2ppo4[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nToday a rather popular iOS application known as AppGratis, was removed from the App Store mysteriously. Originally intended to provide news letters and up-to-date information on the current deals of other applications, this application turned for success rather quickly. Evolving from just an idea, the developers behind the application had gotten together with other popular iOS developers and offered free popular iOS applications for only 24 hours, helping the developer get their applications known. Hours after removal, an Apple spokesman had presented the reasoning for the removal of the application with the following:[quote=Apple Spokesman]\n2.25: Apps that display Apps other than your own for purchase or promotion in a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store will be rejected;\n5.6 Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind.[/quote]\nNo further word has been said about fixing this conflict with Apple. -[size=small][url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57578454-37/free-ios-app-service-appgratis-pulled-from-app-store/]Source[/url][/size]\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nAs all gamers are aware, Microsoft's next gaming console is said to be an updated version of the Xbox 360, known as the Xbox 720. Originally rumored to be announced on April 24, the date for the new gaming console has been moved to May 21. The device will not be shown to the public until the official [url=http://www.e3expo.com/]E3 Event[/url] in Los Angeles this summer. Rumors about the console are saying that the device will be an 'always on' game system, meaning internet connected will be required at all times. An unknown source has also said that the Kinect, an optional add-on for the current Xbox 360, will be a mandatory addition to the Xbox 720. The source has said that the Kinect must be connected, and calibrated in order to work properly.\n\n[color=white][b]Google[/b][/color]\nGoogle has been communicating with a company widely known for its social projects, WhatsApp. For about four to five weeks now, the two companies have been talking about the Mobile Application known as \"WhatsApp\". Rumors are said that Google has been planning to purchase the application for a price just passing 1 billion US$. WhatsApp has been used on all mobile devices, Android, iOS, Windows, and BlackBerry to make instant messaging easier for users. The application eliminates SMS fees, along with cross compatibility issues for other devices.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2ppob[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Daft Punk[/b][/color]\nElectro band Daft Punk have started a video series detailing how fans, friends and family have been a major factor in their latest release [i] Random Access Memories.

You should see what they're doing online just to get people to look at the 'Buy' button.
