We've got quite a bit happening this week starting with the removal of the Gamer's Crew. They have now been turned into the Gamer's Lounge Section which you can check out [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=65]here[/url]. The other group that was removed was Philker after a long life on Hack Forums. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s parting statement can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1424284]here[/url].\r\n\nIf you hadn't noticed, in response to the Database issue, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has had a forum-wide password reset. Mandatory for all leet/uber's it was shown at the top of the site. We can all rest easy that our passwords should be more secure now. The message looked like this: [spoiler][IMG]http://i663.photobucket.com/albums/uu353/fireren/HFPWRESET.png[/IMG][/spoiler]\r\n\nAnother way to make Hack Forums more secure has been introduced by our webmaster, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] who has shared the idea of having secondary e-mails that are non-changeable and encrypted within the database. These e-mails would be used to reset passwords for lost accounts.

For those of you who don't know what spam really is please watch the video [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1413983]here[/url].\r\n\nThis week [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=#4DD0FC][b]Judge Dredd[/b][/color][/url]'s profile has received quite a make over displaying his love for [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=631750][color=white][b]Railyn[/b][/color][/url]. \r\n\nThe staff member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][color=lime][b]xerotic[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of the user group Reverence and is playing a major role in helping them get everything up and running. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848][color=#AAAAFF][b]Qwazz[/b][/color][/url] has stepped down as leader of the new group Informers leaving just [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=616850][color=#AAAAFF][b]Atthackers[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=329361][color=white][b]Valik[/b][/color][/url] to run the group. We wish both members the best of luck. He has also stepped down as leader of the Black Knights, leaving the group with five other leaders to keep it up and running.\r\n\nHack Forums has two new moderators [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=657392][color=#AAAAFF][b]Astonish is nj[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=616850][color=#AAAAFF][b]Atthackers[/b][/color][/url], these two members moderate their group's sub-forums respectively. \r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=588781][color=white][b]Hуѕтєяιa X™[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651051][color=white][b]Wolves[/b][/color][/url] have both been promoted to leaders of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=80618][b][color=#AAAAFF]nokia2mon2[/color][/b][/url]'s group The Red Lions. This is quite a surprise due to what happened last time this group had more than one leader.\r\n\nThe Alliance has opened their doors to new members this week.

Rowling has announced an extension of the Harry Potter series—Pottermore.  This is where Rowling will share some things she could in the books such as information about the characters, locations, and events. This will definitely make Potter fans happy.

Hopefully this will persuade more and more states to support gay marriage. The other five states to support gay marriage are Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Iowa.\r\n\nA near Earth asteroid passed over the Atlantic Ocean this week. It passed 7,500 miles over the Atlantic, which is close considering the Moon is 250,000 miles away from the Earth. It’s girth was estimated to be around the size of a garbage truck.\r\n\nThis week, the Supreme Court banned sales of violent video games to minors to California. This is because “Like books, plays, and movies, video games communicate ideas…” This law is hoping to protect minors from becoming corrupted. Personally, if a minor wants to reenact acts shown in video games, they shouldn’t play the game. Most minors have enough common sense to not reenact these violent acts.\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNInterviews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 1 - Atthackers[/color][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIfxKiX_1hs[/yt][/spoiler]\r\n\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 2 - Astonish is NJ[/color][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler] [color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Hello Astonish, thanks for this interview, First thing I would like to ask is why did you join Hack Forums\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I joined because my friend and I were buying a booter for Xbox, And I did not think I would get involved in this forum until March, and that's when I became active.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] You are a fairly new member here, what did you think of the community when you joined?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I thought that this community was something that was dumb, Until my friend told me to start posting and that’s when this journey began. I am fairly new compared to other people.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Well now you have been here a few months. Has the place changed at all? If so, how?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] Yes, it has. I remember when Atomic was the only booter here. I also remember when I did not know what a group was xD, I use to apply to groups on the usercp \r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Haha, going from that, how does it feel to be a group leader?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] It feels cool, I do not look back. Sometimes I worry \"It's my friend how could I deny him\" But I do anyway you hear the A N D R E W.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] You have a staff member as a group leader. How did you choose him? Was it so you group would be more known, or because he has experience?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] Well it all started when I Pm'ed Hysteria about a month ago telling him, I was making a Coder group. I then asked him \"Would you want to lead it with me\" He said \"I do not code, but this really good coder who is staff by the name of Xerotic knows how to code\" I then Pm'ed you loved the idea. And now look where we are leading the group, we talked about one month ago.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Awesome. Is leading a Hack Forums group easier or harder than you expected?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I think it is harder than I expected. I thought I would make a group and just lead it, Once I bought it I realized how much work WE needed to do before accepting everyone. The reading of the apps were hard because about 10 friends applied and most were denied.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Ah I see. It can be a challenge turning down friends. What do you think about the recent problems on HF regarding security?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I think that they need to stop being babies and stop doing what they do. Omni does a great job and they have to realize that even if they do anything, everything is back to normal within hours because of the hard work that Omni and all the admins and staff do to keep HF the best it can be to keep secure. \r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Now I am going to ask a few questions about your preferences. Which do you prefer, oranges or apples?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I think that I like lemons the best.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Lol. When you were younger, what did you do for fun?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I played baseball, hockey and football. I use to hate video games until three years ago, and then I started playing and won about $750 playing Call of Duty WaW, But now I do not like xbox and I am now selling it. I still play hockey.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Awesome, sports are always good! Now, back to the present. What do you do on an average day?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] I wake up, check Hack Forums and then usually go to the gym. I then go out until like later. Then, I come back on and get back to HF. On weekends I party ;)  and I now have hockey season coming up. So being on HF will be put to a minimum when I have hockey.\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Nice! On HF there have been rumors that the Reverence and Informers have been fighting. Is this true?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] Nope this is something that is false. If I get any PM's about it, I usually eRage. So if you think we are fighting you are 100% wrong this time\r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright. Is there anything we can expect from the Reverence in the coming days?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] You can expect some programs and other exclusive products coming soon, you also want to watch out for some guides and things of other such from our Helpers. We have also other things that will come up which no one should know about and also some big donations. \r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Awesome! I am sure HackForums looks forward to it! Anyway, time to wrap this up, do you have any shout outs?\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] This is what I have waited for; let’s do this <3!  First, I have to give a shout out to you for everything you have done for me. I also have to give Impurity one for all the stuff he has done and for getting me into Minecraft. Some smaller ones are Buzz Lightyear,  Lemonde, McFlurry, Qwazz, Zach and all the Reverence Members. I would also like to make my biggest shout out to Max00355 for getting me to join and be active on Hack Forums. Thanks. \r\n\n[color=lime][b]xerotic:[/b][/color] Alright, thanks for this interview!\r\n[color=white][b]Astonish is NJ[/b][/color] Thank you xerotic, This was something that I never thought can happen, thanks again. I am out.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNClassifieds.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[align=left][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1417161][img]http://i.min.us/ibt5jq.jpg[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=right][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1416451][img]http://i.imgur.com/EoHGr.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=left][url=http://www.mskeys.in][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/X3GG1.jpg[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNTeam.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\n[color=white][b]Publisher & Head Writer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848]Qwazz[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Publishers Assistant[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033]xerotic[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Writers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712]Cobalt[/url] - Other News\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=153686]Fireren[/url] - Headlines\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url] - User News\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Reporters[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=129444]3x0r_$c0rPi0n[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=355307]chocothunda[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=126243]Decoy[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453]ReactioNz[/url] - Head Reporter\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=168826]Tyler777[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=200751]Zach[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=115612]-BoodyE-[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=137080]Boxing[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=92059]Aptitude[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Editor[/b] [/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=234024]Deities[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Graphic Designer[/b][/color] \r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671]panDa.[/url]\r\n[/list]",
