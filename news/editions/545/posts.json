If you have never heard of Hack Forum News, dont worry we have you covered. We are a team of members from the Hack Forums community who are journilists and writers, and we are here to keep you in the loop of the changes around the site and now even around the world.[/b]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/headlines.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=121196]\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6303093][color=#ffffff]Convo Public Room Open[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nOmniscient has announced that the Public Conversation Room has been temporarily reopened this week while he looks for a JavaScript-proficient developer to help resolve ongoing issues with the Group Convo Rooms. Features like /flip and other Convo games aren’t functioning as intended. The long-term goal remains to close the Public Room and transition fully to GCRs (Group Convo Rooms), but progress is currently stalled due to code difficulties.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=large][url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6303090][color=#ffffff]Large DDoS Attacks[/color][/url][/size][/b][/u] By [mention=1]\r\nOmniscient has informed the community of several high-traffic DDoS attacks targeting HackForums in recent weeks.

While acknowledging a past comment made during a difficult moment, he reaffirmed his 18-year commitment to HackForums and made it clear the site isn’t going anywhere. Thanks were given to Staff for handling the situation, and the message closed with confidence that this will soon be just another chapter in HackForums history.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/statistics-header.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=121196]\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/vNJE4Tu.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[img]https://hackforums.net/images/hfnews/awards-header.png[/img]\r\n[size=medium][b]Writer -[/b][/size] [mention=2331053]\r\n[color=#ffffff]\r\n\r\n[b]Quick reminder, the donation awards page has had a bit of a change.

RCE exploits are still a problem, and it's not an overnight fix. Here are some recommended tips for dealing with this situation.\r\n\r\nStop playing immediately: Do not launch or play any online modes for Call of Duty games listed on your PC. Do not assume you are safe in private matches.\r\nAwait official confirmation: The only safe source of information is from the official Call of Duty or Activision social media channels and their support websites. Do not trust rumors or unofficial sources.\r\nDo not download unofficial fixes: Be extremely cautious of any third-party downloads claiming to be a \"patch\" or a \"fix\" for this exploit. These are very likely to be malware themselves. Only install updates directly through Battle.net or Steam.\r\nCheck your system: While there is no evidence of widespread attacks yet, it is good practice to run a full antivirus scan on your computer if you have played any of these games in the last few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops II\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Ghosts\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered (on official servers)\r\n[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops III (A patch was released in 2023 by Treyarch.

The list of Entergram games being delisted is notably exclusive to the Japanese PlayStation Store. Entergram has stated that they are \"ending sales\" for these 106 games.\r\n\r\n\"Stop Killing Games\" is a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers. An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods - with no stated expiration date - but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.\r\nhttps://www.stopkillinggames.com/\r\n\r\n[color=#72FF84]Notable Game Releases (July 2025)[/color]\r\n\r\nDonkey Kong Bananza is available now for gamers on the Nintendo Switch 2.\r\n\r\nSports fans are not left out, with the long-awaited return of college football in EA Sports College Football 26 out now.\r\n\r\nGrand Theft Auto V and its online component has been officially released in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
