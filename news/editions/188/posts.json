For the unaware, the changes modified access to posting rights for normal members within the section, in an attempt to minimize the active trolls, LQP, and other unwanted pests within the forum's most controversial section. The poll has now been running for about two weeks and the result is stunningly even, with about ninety members being against the return of normal members to the section and an equal number saying that their involvement would be a welcomed change. From reactions to the initial change, it was clear that while it may have prevented many of the prevalent problems, it did leave those with a legitimate want for mature discussions unable to participate because they may not be financially able to upgrade. The future of the section depends on the input from forum members, so now is the chance to speak out if one wishes to do so. The thread can be read here: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4118163][b]SRPP Quality and Policy Change[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Possible Addition of Reputational Comments[/b][/color]\nIn a response to a thread made by the Ub3r member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1454187][color=#00AAFF][b]Ombra[/b][/color][/url] in the [b]Suggestions and Ideas[/b] sections concerning a possibility of commenting on reputation left on a profile, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated that he himself had been considering the idea since a similar previous suggestion last week. In a nutshell, this feature, if implemented, would allow users to be able to place a comment as an explanation or other usage on reputation left for them. Upon viewing a member's reputation page, the comment would appear underneath the reputation it was intended for and gives members an opportunity to, for example, say that it was false. In the event of a false deal dispute, a link to an explanation thread could be left as well. On the positive end of things, a simple \"thank you as well\" could be added to a positive reputation following a successful exchange or deal. As of now, this feature is a \"maybe\", and most certainly not guaranteed to be implemented within any time frame. The suggestion, along with [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] reply, can be viewed [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4139382][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/gIeGa1Z.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1697806][color=#EFEFEF][b]SWS.[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation.

How are you doing on this fine Sunday, Krew?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] I am doing good, Clique! Although it is already Monday haha. How are you?\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Dang timezones, amiright? I'm doing quite alright my man. Just finished assembling my new table and chair. Feelin' good. Any shout outs before we continue?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] Of course! Big shoutout to Xen0n for being awesome, and of course my friends in 143.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Speakin' of 143. What do you guys have planned? The group has been, well -- pretty quiet recently. Are you allowed to tell us?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] We do indeed have some plans coming up, but as always it stays a little secret till the moment is there to keep people curious, you know?\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds good. Looking forward to it! So, you've been around here for a while, eh? How are you enjoying your time on this site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, almost 5 years. I have really enjoyed my time being on this forum, though there were moments where I just wanted to leave the website for good. I learned a lot from this forum, and I am really happy about that.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Safe to say that you can see yourself here for the years to come? Also, what do you do outside of here -- anyways?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] Yep! Planning to stay on HF till I get bored of it. May take some time if you ask me!\nOutside of HF? I am currently in college where I am going for a Business degree and hopefully after that I can create my own company (already have one, but not official). And of course I like to hang out with friends, going out, and last but not least 420blazeit. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Almost finished with school? Best of luck with your future endeavors. Which are the main sections that you frequent here, on HF?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b] Correct, 1 more year and I am done with the hell called school! I really like to hang out in the 143 subforum, and I used to like the HFL33T section until Omni came and deleted all the Upgraded Members Lounges because a lot of them were LQ. I don't really specifically choose a section to post in though, I just check out interesting threads and post on it if I feel the need to, and got something to say about it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Nice going! What's your opinion on Omni's decisions with the changes about the upgraded forums?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] I was pretty mad about it to be honest with you, but what change can I make, right? Was pretty harsh of Omni to delete threads with quality conversations in it. Had good talks with all kinds of people.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'm sure yall can make a skype chat and continue there, eh? So. I almost forgot to ask: how'd you find out about this site here man?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] Of course, of course! Already exists, hehe. \nWell, that is awkward....I joined this website because I had the slighest clue about Cain & Abel and wanted to know how it worked. My friends in class didn't know the slighest thing, so HF was where I had to be!\nFyi: http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=67721\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Would you recommend this board to a friend with similar interests as yourself? Kinda embarrassing to see how you were when you first joined -- amiright?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color]Yes, though I would recommend them to use a different approach to ask for more information than create a rather skiddy thread as newcomer! \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Perfect advice. Anything you'd like to say before we're officially done with this interview? (Sorry for keeping you up, by the way!)\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=792136]Krew[/url]:[/b][/color] I want to thank you for the interview if that's alright.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] Hello and thank you for having me on the news, I'd like to give a shout-out to all the people I hurt through the recent incident and I'd most importantly like to thank everyone who has stuck by me on my time here.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] You are a previous leader of Respawn and I'm sure most members seen the drama. Do care to fill us in on the situation between you and Astonish?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, not to long ago I was a leader of the newly revamped gaming group, Respawn. My time their wasn't that fascinating due to the things that happened that most members have read about, right now I myself yet to know where me and Astonish stand, but all I know is it's not something good. I'm sure the word will spread out in the near future.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] That's a bummer to hear. I know you're gone now, but what do you think will become of the group? Any plans on returning?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] No, I don't plans or never will to return to Respawn nor member, nor leader. Due to Astonish's care for something he owns that is one of the most valuable things on Hack Forums, Respawn in my eyes will never go anywhere. The amount of effort I put into the group was enormous and it still failed due to him, therefore I see it going no where. The group itself, name, concept and graphics have huge potential Astonish's disease to money and inactivity will bring the group to no glory.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well it's a bummer to hear you have no plan on returning, my wallet cringes for you. So tell me what is it that you do online to be so financially successful?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] Believe it or not, I do not make that much money compare to 70% of marketers on this forum. I save and work hard for my money, I didn't believe at the time when I bought the leadership spot I'd be utterly wasting my money, So believe it or not I lost big time. But back to the question you asked, I make most of my money offline with my job, on the other hand I make some nice bank of my MineCraft Service and selling small bits and pieces around the forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's good to hear then, hard work truly does pay off. So tell me what are some of your hobbies outside of the wonderful world of the interwebs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] That's a great question, I enjoy sport, I play for the 1st 17's in Basketball and recently one a huge tournament. I also enjoy hanging out with my mates, designing woodwork and IT.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So you were pretty big in the Hacker Craft scene at one point, do you still play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] Yes not to long ago I was highly addicted to Hacker Craft and it's section on site, although recently I lost my vibe and started to drift away from the server while still staying highly active in the SF. I mainly stop playing due to lac of interest in MineCraft itself. After I completely stopped playing I will still active in the SF and helped out user as much as I can, although not to long after I got a PM telling me \" You're such a suck up in the HC Section, You post in every thread!\" \"We know you're trying to achieve Staff\" and things amongst those lines, I couldn't be bothered with arguing so I then on drifted away from the section to.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree with you, Hacker Craft is going downhill and nothing is being done. I've been on the fence leaving the server, but can't seem to get away for more than a day or two. This has been bugging more for quite some time now, why are you still l33t?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] Now that's a very good question and I have a nice story behind it that I'm sure everyone would love to hear. Although before I start I'd like to say I am NOT permanently denied and am able to reapply in 1 Week. So, months ago I was partners with someone that I shall not name. Are sales where going good and our products where expanding dramatically. One day he posted a thread selling a laptop, as any business partner would do.. I vouched for him. Later on he was found to scamming the member $1,000+ for the laptop and was banned for Multi Accounting along that. I had no clue about this but was -10 by Omniscient for \"Vouching for Scamming Ban Evaders\" ever since then (4 Times) Iv'e been denied Uber, recently Omniscient removed the -10 after our conversation. Hopefully in the upcoming weeks I'll be accepted due to the fact it's gone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Damn that's rough. I wish you the best of luck reapplying. So you're a June 2013 member, which is relatively new, how did you find HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you, I damn hope I get accepted. Yes I am not that old on HF, I found HF in a very funny way. Once I was apart of this MineCraft Forum back when I was the biggest noob at computers and everything related. A member who is on this site right now \"AlreadyCoded\" linked me to a HF Thread saying \"LOL [LINK]\" via skype I had no clue what it was, believe it or not no matter how embarrassing this may I sound as straight is it loaded I exited away as I thought it was a virus or something! but after he explained I signed up as a noob, got warnings, became leet, joined my first group and just went from there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Haha we found HF in similar ways, the domain scared the crap out of me. You're in a wide variety of groups, tell me how have groups impacted your HF experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] When I started I made a great relationship with +Awesome who isn't really active on Hack Forums any more. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be where I am today. He accepted me into the GFX section for Complexity, I spent numerous months in Complexity and enjoyed it a lot but then was kicked for the Hacker Craft Award Scam report that was quickly resolved, which was months ago. from then on I found a interest in groups especially gaming groups. Iv'e been in Respawn, Skill, Instinct and now Nexus. Overall basically groups are like a family to me but all located in different countries for when I want to hang out.

If you could change one thing about the forum what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] As much as I want to co-operate with this Interview I absolutely cannot answer this question, HF is a amazing place to me and it would take a lot and I mean a lot of thinking to pick something.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's a good note to end on then. Do you have any final remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1839274][color=#EFEFEF][b]Skitlz:[/b][/color][/url] I'd just like to say thank you for having me on the HF News, It means a lot to me. I'd also love to give one last shout-out to Acroz for everything he has done for me.

Today we're here with Eeluminati. How are you doing today man? Any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Thanks for interviewing me! I have a few shoutouts, X-RАTED, Aura, Freddy Krueger and Zayne.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Excellent. So, why don't ou tell us a little bit about your interests and how you discovered HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Well, I originally discovered HF after being ratted for all my Runescape gold.. The guy who hacked me told me to go to HF and learn something there. I still honestly have no idea who he was to this date, oh well. I enjoy computer games, hacking topics, graphics (shoutout to my boys @ FBN) and football/soccer. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Do you have any active services on HF? If so, what do they offer?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] I have a graphics service thread which get's a fair amount of attention. It's fun to do, but can be a hassle when people purchasing don't cooperate. I also currently have a free graphics request thread at the moment, people can visit that if they're interested.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's awesome. Since you've been registered with HF what's the one thing that keeps you coming back?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Recently it's been the knowledge I'm able to gain. With the change to Legion, I am really looking forward to learning a lot, it should go really well. I am also building some nice friendships with users. I probably missed quite a few in the shoutouts and they'll probably hate me for it but oh well. I am liking all my groups right now, Nexus is fun and Empire is awesome. It's really just the enjoyable community as of now, but who knows, I might hate HF in a month. :P Register with the referral 'Eeluminati' and get 5 posts for $1! LET ME KNOW ONCE DONE! http://businessboards.net/member.php?action=register&referrer=9\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] The Empire is a great group. So, what other interests do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Chilling with friends, and chilling alone. I like to relax and just chat with people online and in real life. It's relaxing and you can really just mellow down have down-to-earth chats with people. I am just in to that kind of stuff, I know some people aren't. What about yourself?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah I agree. I think everyone on HF would agree that the interne tis wonderful. This interview is about you muy good man. So if you could change one thing abut HF what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Well, I know it is next to impossible to change, but I wish it could. There is a lot of corruption among group leaders and members offering services etc. It's a bit saddening finding out that people are a lot different once you get to know them rather than their appearance of their HF posts. It's impossible to change, but it's a wish of mine. Oh I wish.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] There's so much more to people then their online profiles that's for sure. Would you ever want to run your own group on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Hmm, well I would and I wouldn't. I'd love to be in charge and do what I want to do, but I don't think I have a fair enough attitude to deal with members issues and drama that goes on. It would be nice to try at one stage, but I feel as it requires a lot of time and effort to be a really good leader, and if I was in that sitation, that's the kind of leader I'd want to be. Right now I am happy being a member in groups, I don't need to have power to enjoy myself on HF. :p\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] No you definitely shouldn't. So out of all the groups you've been apart of which one was your favourite and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Let me see, since joining in march 2011, I have been in a fair few. Graphic masters, the old Respawn (controller UB), the new Respawn, Legion, Techsperts, Eminence, Infamous, Empire, Nexus and Reverence. Up until now, I have honestly enjoyed the Empire the most. It's active, not too strict, great quality members, great leaders, great everything. There are very few cons about it compared to other groups I've been in.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Are there any groups you'd like to join in the future? Or pephaps any groups in general that you're a fan of?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] I'd like to join either Polymath, Brotherhood or Null in the future, but I don't see that happening too soon, I just don't see myself capable of the expertise required in these (mainly Null & BH, Polymath is just very hidden and I want to see what it's all about). I would also like to join the writ3rs some day. I speak to past members and they say it's very boring doing things for the news every week, but it just leads me to think they were just in it for the userbar. I don't see how someone can be interested in their field, research it once a week and compile a few paragraphs on it then not enjoy it. You're learning things as you go, I'd love the opportunity to be apart one day.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Polymath does seem like an interesting group. I too would like to learn more about it, anyway thanks for taking time out of your day to do this interview with us. If you have any closing statements feel free to make them now\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1987673][b]Eeluminati:[/b][/url] Not really. Sorry to anyone I forgot to shoutout, you should know who you are if we talk a lot, I couldn't really think straight. Thanks Clark for taking the time to interview me, was fun! Have a nice day. :)[/spoiler]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

This is a tool I've talked about in the past, its full name is Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. It is a security tool, and they just reached a major milestone, filled with some major changes; however, the question remains whether they are for the better. The classic and what was generally perceived as good interface of MBAM has been totally redone. While the company states that its new flashy UI is more intuitive, many people are saying it reminds them of rogue antivirus software among other things. Others are thoroughly enjoying the change. While it is still mostly in the beta portion, many people are jumping on board. Though, we are seeing a fairly big difference in the marketing of the tool. They have switched from a one time payment for the paid version to a subscription model of $24.95 per year. This is a major change from the previously lifetime access you would get. With this change though they are trying to break this preconceived notion that they are only secondary protection, rather than something which should be used actively. This change may allow the company to truly broaden their horizons, and compete with some of the industries dominant forces. Moving on, there have been several other changes. For one we're now seeing additional rootkit detection and removal, as well as their 'Chameleon' software. The last major change was described in very general terms as improvement to their detection and removal engine. MBAM can be quite a powerful tool for dealing with malware, and it truly provides ease-of-access to security for those who may not be experienced in the field. These changes due shed some light on a few other things, as we're seeing other tools' features being pulled into their main product. Two other tools from this company are Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit and Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit. Each are excellent tools, but it is becoming clear that modules are being shared between these tools. Personally, I think MBAM is moving in the right direction, and hopefully they can break this shell they have created for themselves. My only worry is that money will get in the way.\n\nHere are some pictures of the new UI.\n[spoiler=][img]http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware-2-0-Has-Fully-Redesigned-UI-422225-3.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n[spoiler=][img]http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware-2-0-Has-Fully-Redesigned-UI-422225-4.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n[spoiler=][img]http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware-2-0-Has-Fully-Redesigned-UI-422225-5.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][b]NSA May Take a Hit[/b][/color]\nPresident Obama has pushed forward a plan that would limit the NSA greatly, but not entirely. While the fight over privacy vs. security keeps on waging, President Obama is trying to find the middle ground. His new bill proposes that the NSA or National Security Agency will no longer be able to collect bulk data, but rather have to get a get ordered mandate from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or FISC to get the data from the telephone companies. This is a major step up from what we are seeing now. While this is not set in stone, and it dependent on the highly partisan congress, many Americans are hoping this will get passed. Many politicians and Americans think this is not enough though. They want truly sweeping reform to utterly get rid of most of the NSA and their spying habits. The question is what that means for our security in the future due to this sensationalized period of overzealous hatred of anything which even minutely infringes on what they call privacy.\n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nKeeping your software up to date should be a core habit of all computer users. Many people tend to slack with this, leaving gaping holes in their security for anyone to take advantage of. The main problem is that the population is too lazy for the numerous updates. Not to mention that it can slow down a computer for a while, and it can mount up quickly, so some ignore it. While this seems like an easy way out, it is most certainly a huge issue for anyone who wishes to remain secure online. Therefor, I advocate software which makes keeping track and even updating easier! I suggest checking out [url=http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/][b]Secunia PSI[/b][/url] or [url=http://www.filehippo.com/updatechecker][b]File Hippo Update Checker[/b][/url].

He brings up an interesting point about the ideological leanings of many Bitcoin users towards \"crazy\" libertarianism. \"Without being too inflammatory, the user base for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly informed about currency systems and macroeconomics.\" He goes on to explain that while it was originally created by well-informed libertarians, the culture has degraded into polarized, uninformed discussion. Branching off from his disdain for the uninformed Bitcoin crowed, he went on to discuss the merits of Dogecoin, a currency too stupid to have ideological ties, so to speak. \"[Dogecoin] has all the features of bitcoin – technologically speaking – but frees itself from the libertarian culture of Bitcoin that turns off so much of the mainstream.\" Regardless of cryptocurrency ties, Wong noted that Bitcoin et al. are catalysts for a payment system that's nearly frictionless, with fewer fees, and without the necessity of trust. \n\n[b][color=white]Mt. Gox May Have Lost as Few as 386 BTC to Transaction Malleability[/color][/b]\nDespite initial rumors that bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox lost hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin to transaction malleability, new research suggests that Gox lost far fewer coins than it reported. A team of researchers at the ETH Zurich University created specialized Bitcoin nodes to analyze double spend attacks, and were able to analyze transactions dating back as far as January 2013. The team concluded that only 302,000 Bitcoins could have ever even been involved in transaction malleability attacks, with under 2,000 likely belonging to the troubled exchange. However, the real number is likely far lower than this. The report concluded that \"even if all of these attacks were targeted against Mt. Gox, Mt. Gox needs to explain the whereabouts of 849,600 Bitcoin\".\n\n[b][color=white]Japan Raises Consumption Tax to 8%[/color][/b]\nJapan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, raised Japan's consumption tax, a sort of national sales tax, to 8%, up from 5% earlier this year. The last hike of the Consumption Tax was in 1997, under Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, which went from 3% to the previous 5%. However, Japan also plans to raise the Consumption another two points to 10% in October 2015, providing that everything goes well with the initial rise. However, investors are skeptical that Japan's economy will survive the shock. However, the Bank of Japan is remaining unperturbed with this, claiming that \"Japan’s employment situation is far more favorable than that in 1997. The [Bank of Japan] believes that, while Japan’s economy will temporarily decline immediately after the consumption-tax hike, it will continue to grow\". However, before the tax raise took effect on Tuesday, some industries saw a spike in demand. Namely the paper industries, with retailers nationwide creating fliers reminding customers to get some last minute shopping in before the tax hike.\n\n[b][color=white]Bitcoin Will Be Taxed as Property in the US[/color][/b]\nIn a recent ruling, the United States' Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it will be taxing Bitcoin in the same category as stocks, where gains and losses made by trading must be reported to the IRS, and any payments made to independent contractors (e.g Freelancers) must be reported on a 1099 form. The IRS has remained silent on the issue of taxation and Bitcoins for years now. However, this ruling comes in the face of the fast-approaching deadline for US citizens to file tax returns. This could leave some Bitcoiners scrambling to report their earnings and losses, especially from those whose records may be lost in defunct exchanges. However, what remains unclear is how the US has any hope of taxing crypto currencies aside from the fiat conversions that go in, and come out of them, if they have further plans of regulation at all.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/TF7PsyM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft Announces New Xbox Head[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft announced this week that Phil Spencer will become the next head of the Xbox division. Previously serving as the head of Microsoft Studios, Spencer will now be in charge of just about everything Xbox, including Xbox LIVE, Music, and Video. Based on his reputation from his previous positions, Spencer is known for bringing the things gamers really want to the table, which could mean a bright future for the Xbox brand and the Xbox One. Spencer has replaced previous Xbox Head, Don Mattrick, who left Microsoft to become CEO of Zynga last year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed the reason for his promotion: \"Combining all our software, gaming and content assets across the Xbox team under a single leader and aligning with the OSG team will help ensure we continue to do great work across the Xbox business, and bring more of the magic of Xbox to all form factors, including tablets, PCs and phones.\"\n\n[color=white][b]List of 100+ games to be released for the Playstation 4 this year[/b][/color]\nSony released a list this week of over 100 games that will be released for the Playstation 4 this year.

In order to find them, you must be zoomed in at a certain percentage and tap them once you find them. They are set in all different places of the world, and is said to be over 100 different Pokemon scattered around the world waiting to be caught. People who catch all of the Pokemon will reportedly be offered a job at Google, and will be invited to Google for a tournament as well.

Notch released in a statement that he cancelled the project because \"Facebook creeps me out.” Though ports of the game already exist, they aren't official nor do they have any branding from the studio. This would make a decent alternative to the game many were looking forward to.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of March 30, 2014:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]The Elder Scrolls Online - April 4, 2014 - PC, Mac\n[*]Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga - April 3, 2014 - Wii U\n[*]MLB 14: The Show - April 1, 2014 - PS Vita, PS3, PS4\n\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Upcoming Gaming Events:[/b][/color]\n\n[list]\n[*]None Reported\n\nInterested in having your gaming event posted in here?

The feature has been requested by many and has equally been something that many have been waiting for. That being said, its implementation will likely come with the next major update, 1.8. Mojang has dedicated [url=https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/928638-minecraft-usernames]an entire article[/url] to just the speculations/details of the future feature with clarity that it's coming for sure.\n\n[color=white][b]TU14 is Out![/b][/color]\nGiven that its arrival has been anticipated since the beginning of time, TU14 has finally been released for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Minecraft. Not only have many bugs been fixed from the prior version, but many features have been added and many changes have came to the survival mode of the game. Many of the new features or implementations, though, have been on PC version of the game for a long time now. That being said, many can expect a new skin pack release in the near future. \n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nWith the help of Robust (previously themadman300), Omniscient has finally reimplemented the factions plugin.

The procedures, known as bariatric surgery, involve techniques such as gastric banding which help selected patients lose weight. A new study of 29,000 patients reveals that patients receiving this procedure reduce their death rates by 40% and half their chance of having a heart attack. This research is the first comprehensive review of the impact of surgery on heart disease, stroke disease and death. According to Senior author Dr. Yoon Loke from UEA's Norwich Medical School, these findings suggest that bariatric surgery should be seriously considered by obese people who have a high risk of heart disease. \n\n[color=white][b]Underweight People At A Higher Risk of Dying Than Obese People[/b][/color]\nA new study led by Dr. Joel Ray, a physician-researcher at St. Michael's Hospital and the hospital's Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute has revealed that underweight people are at a higher risk of dying than obese people. He found that adults who are underweight – with a B.M.I. under 18.5 or less – have a 1.8 times higher risk of dying than those with a \"normal\" B.M.I. of 18.5 to 24.9. The risk of dying is 1.2 times higher for people who are obese (B.M.I. of 30-34.9) and 1.3 times higher for those who are severely obese (a B.M.I. of 35 or higher). The studies were done on underweight people over 5 years or longer, to avoid those underweight for cancer or terminal illness purposes. Common causes of being underweight include malnourishment, heavy alcohol or drug use, smoking, low-income status, mental health and poor self-care.\n\n[b][color=white]Brain Scans Link Justice With Reason, Not Emotion[/color][/b]\nPeople who care about justice are swayed more by reason than emotion. That is the unexpected finding of new brain scan research from the University of Chicago and Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (f.M.R.I.) brain-scanning device, the team studied what happened in the participants’ brains as they judged videos depicting behavior that was morally good or bad.  The participants were then asked to rate on a scale how much they would blame or praise the actor seen in the video. The brain imaging yielded surprises. During the behavior-evaluation exercise, people with high justice sensitivity showed more activity than average participants in parts of the brain associated with higher-order cognition. Brain areas commonly linked with emotional processing were not affected. This new study shows that those seeking justice are not driven by emotion, rather, they are driven cognitively.\n\n[color=white][b]Smoke-Free Air Policies Seem To Protect The Heart[/b][/color]\nPolicies prohibiting smoking in workplaces and other public spaces may substantially improve public health by reducing heart disease and death, according to a new study on the impact of Michigan's statewide smoking ban. In their study, researchers found a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular disease and death with related hospitalizations decreasing by 2.03 percent. Studies on previous indoor smoking bans have consistently shown a major decrease in hospital admissions for heart attacks after smoke-free laws went into effect. Public health officials have warned that breathing even small amounts of second-hand smoke can cause heart damage to nonsmoking adults and may trigger heart attacks in those who are already at risk.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7zlNcBz.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Turkish Leaders Admit to Planning a False Flag Terror to Justify Going to War With Syria[/b][/color]\n\"I'll make up a cause of war by ordering a missile attack on Turkey\" is one many comments that was leaked from conversations involving the key Turkish military and political leaders. When confronted about these conversations, the Turkish Prime Minister could only describe the leaking of the tape as ‘villainous’. That’s right, the leaking, not the actual act itself. In an attempt to stop this recording from reaching the Turkish population, the Prime Minister blocked YouTube, against the court’s ruling of these bans.\n\n[color=white][b]Preaching About The Gay[/b][/color]\nStudents have responded with outrage and resorted to launching a petition to have education chief's apologize for the words of Sister Jane Dominic Laurel. In a lecture given by the nun, the children were basically told that masturbation, divorced parents and porn can and would make them gay. The North Carolina’s Charlotte Catholic High School nun was heard by over 2000 students. One student has claimed that she said \"gay people are gay due to an absent father figure, and have not received the masculinity they should... also a guy could be gay if he masturbates\". I guess that makes all of us here gay, huh?\n\n[color=white][b]US Courts Lift the Funding Cap[/b][/color]\nThe US Supreme court removed the limit on the amount of contributions donors can make to political candidates, meaning that any campaign can effectively be funded by rich individuals.  The overall cap of $123,200 over two years has been removed, allegedly doing little to stop bribery \"which is seriously restricting participation process\". This is one of those issues that will resolve itself with time. Do you think it'll increase bribery? Tell us what you think in your replies.\n\n[color=white][b]Earthquake in Chile[/b][/color]\nAn earthquake with a magnitude of 8.2 hit northern Chile on April 3rd, but caused surprisingly little damage, with only 6 deaths being reported today. The earthquake hit the northern coastal city of Iquique with a population 200,000 people. The earthquake meant that thousands had to evacuate and spend a night in the cold, fearing a possible tsunami. The earthquake meant that 300 inmates also escaped from the women's jail, forcing officials to close off the border to Peru. The president Bachelet waited more than five hours to address the people, which was a wise move, given that the last time she addressed the people, the tsunami warning was cancelled too early and hundreds were swept away by massive waves. Our hearts lie with these people.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/qIhVVNQ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Japanese Phones To Get Alerts For Man-Made Attacks[/b][/color]\nFolks from Japan already get phone alerts for natural disasters, but now they are going to get alerts for something that seems a little grim. Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency states that citizens of Japan will receive alerts when there is a hostile missile launch, chemical attack, terrorist attacks or any other human-made threats. The system will use the same technology that they use for the natural disaster system, but will be tweaked slightly. Hopefully they don't have to use it, but it's better to have it just in case.\n\n[color=white][b]GS5 Can Double As Baby Monitor[/b][/color]\nThe Galaxy S5, already known to have a ton of features, such as being a fitness guru of sorts. News comes now that the phone could double as a baby monitor if you have a Gear Watch. The technology uses the phone as a listening station and sends vibrations to your Gear Watch to let you know when your child is crying at night, or during a nap. This could come in handy for people who are always running around the home and don't have time for a dedicated monitor.\n\n[color=white][b]Google To Become Strict On Android Apps With Deceptive Ads[/b][/color]\nGoogle has issued a new set of rules for Google Play apps to try to stay ahead of developers with malicious intent. This includes apps that have pop-up ads that spoof a notification to make you click something thinking it's something else. These rules also target promotion tactics, that cause downloads without permission to do so. They are making developers and advertisers clarify when and how they use in-app purchases on top of it all. Google is currently allowing a 15-day grace period before getting rid of the devs.\n\n[color=white][b]Blackberry Seriously Considering Bringing BBM To Desktops[/b][/color]\nNot too long ago, Blackberry was very hesitant in allowing BBM to find its way to other platforms, but now this may change. It was only very recently that Blackberry allowed the service to go on to Android and iOS, but they supposedly aren't going to stop there. We have heard that is coming to Windows Phone in the coming months, and it could actually come to desktop in the near future. The move could allow users to start a conversation at their desktop and bring it to the phone to continue it. This could bring up the users and get them some more revenue as well, seeing as they have been taking large losses recently.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/eXQx0Yx.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]April Fools from Lil Wayne[/color][/b]\nGiven his odd turn of events in his career, Weezy's word on his retirement can always be taken seriously. With that said, [url=https://twitter.com/LilTunechi/status/450979724576428032]a tweet[/url] was posted by him to contribute to April Fools by saying he was retiring. Many, though, questioned the legitimacy of the statement. Just last month, Weezy [url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/1010791/lil-wayne-says-he-will-do-another-solo-album-for-25-to-35-million.jhtml]made a statement[/url] regarding the fact that he'd never make another solo album-- at least not for free; $25-35 million, to be exact actually. With that in mind, many still believe the aforementioned in that his retirement might be true.\n\n[b][color=white]Avicii Too Sick to Perform at Ultra[/color][/b]\nTo have recently discovered he had problems with his gallbladder, the famous EDM artist, Avicii was hospitalized on-the-spot for an excruciating pain in his side during Ultra Music Festival. While he was scheduled to be the closing act during one of the days of the event, he was too sick too perform and therefore had Deadmau5 cover for him. It's said that he's making progress and is feeling better, however, and will likely be back to himself during the week. At least he's been able to [url=https://twitter.com/Avicii/status/450834214481821696]catch up on House of Cards[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Pharrell to Join The Voice[/color][/b]\nFor the seventh season of the popular television show, The Voice, the popular pop artist, Pharrell, has joined as a voice coach. Following several tweets annotating his official decision, NBC's The Voice seems very happy to have him aboard. Even Ellen DeGeneres [url=https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/451079685611339776]made a comment[/url] regarding the matter. Nevertheless, though, given Pharrell's achievements and accomplishments in modern music, it's clear that he'll do a great job and an even greater addition to the show.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

Truth me told, this isn't the first time a group on HF has \nsupported that game, but a full out group dedicated to that single \ngame will not go well and thus concludes my negative impression \nof the group because it seems that Nexus will not hold any official \nteams nor become a LoL community at this moment in time, which \nresults in a halfway between an organised team and a community.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1221375][i]-Ryuusei Cartwright[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right]-=-=-\n\n[i]\"Everybody seems to enjoy the change or are too scared to give \nan honest opinion.

Void was one of the best groups to be part off, \nit was a very fun group to be part in, and not to mention it was \nhelping the SRPP section gain some credibility.
