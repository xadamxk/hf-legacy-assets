I immediately investigated to confirm the validity. I spent hours making adjustments to secure the data.\"[/i] None of the data includes Credit Card information or user's passwords. However, Omniscient stated: [i]\"The data in our orders database consists of the order first name,last name, address, email, phone, ip, order date, and user id. More or less probably everything needed to DOX thousands of members. HF accounts themselves are secure. No passwords are in the DB.\"[/i] You can read more about it [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3235050]here[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3235989]here[/url]. Shortly after the announcement, parts of the database were released, all of which were on the members of Legion, one of the official groups, from a site associated with one of the leaders of root, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1448109]RyanC[/url]. Omniscient has since revoked [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1448109]RyanC[/url]'s signature privileges due to the personal data of members being located on the website in his signature. At the time of this edition's release, the database is only with a small number of people and is not posted for the general public to download in full.\n\n[color=white][b]Site Changes[/b][/color]\nSome new changes happened on the site this week, most notably would be that 'Post to PM' threads are no longer allowed on Hack Forums. For more information you can see Omniscient's Announcement [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3219429]here[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/announcements.php?aid=5]here[/url]. Omniscient also made a tweet about it [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/296703571334926336]here[/url] stating: \"[i]'Post here and PM me' no longer allowed on HF. Enough of this LQP practice. 25% warning issued for violations and threads locked.[/i]\" Omniscient also announced that members are able to hide content to l33t and Ub3r users, it was formerly just for Ub3rs. The announcement can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3219703]here[/url] and the tweet is [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/status/296734224680116224]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]The Angels Fall From Grace[/b][/color]\nA lot of recent drama has surrounded the new group 'The Angels' formerly known as 'Logic'. The group's owner amassed a large amount of debt totaling over $5,300+ USD. The Deal Dispute that uncovered the debt is now the largest thread in the Deal Dispute section and can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3226734]here[/url]. Currently the groups owner, Sandshrew, is working to pay all his debts. His thread about the paying back of his debts can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3230707]here[/url]. The Angels was originally going to be an invite only group, but Sandshrew has announced that he will be selling membership spots if allowed by Omniscient. The future of the group is currently uncertain as Omniscient hasn't made a statement regarding the issues yet. Here are statements from those involved:\n[list][*][i]\"I am very disappointed how it came out. I was very excited about getting it up and turning it into a very prestigious group. Many problems came up, and now I am down $1.2k as well as many other members had losses.\"[/i] - Juicy Booty (Leader of The Angels)\n[*][i]\"No matter what happens, it will be what it is. I can't change time, but I do regret selling Logic. The only thing I can do is move on and work with Sandshrew. I wish the best for Sandshrew, but money is something you do not play with.\"[/i] - Hexicial (Former Owner of Logic)\n[*][i]\"I will be repaying everyone that I owe. I started selling spots to the group to help pay them off quicker. Once everyone is paid off, spots won't be sold.\"[/i] - Sandshrew (Owner of The Angels)[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]WiFi Gang[/b][/color]\nEminence's owner, WiFi., has changed his group to 'WiFi Gang.' The group's description of the group is: [i]WiFi Gang is a group dedicated to the musical arts, We are composed of talented Artists, Songwriters, Producers & Musicians.[/i] Their announcement thread can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3220964]here[/url]. They are currently recruiting [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3225860]here[/url]. The group has an official site http://wifigang.com/. It currently features songs from the members. WiFi. expects to start adding members within a week. He has stated that it will be based off the quality of their music and applications. This is the newest group change bringing it to 4 official group changes in the last month, others include Beacon, Legion, and The Angels.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIgo[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1462090][b]Special One[/b][/url] reached 1,000 reputation points!\n\n[color=white][b]Repfucks[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1070150][color=#383838][b]tdog0403[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1168835][color=black][b]Raspberry Pi[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=861282][color=black][b]Badass[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1077925][color=black][b]Imagination.[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=904208][b]Liquified™[/b][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1140865][color=black][b]serg06[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=746220][color=#0066FF][b]Hentai[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=772964][color=black][b]Callum.[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1228258][color=black][b]Darken[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Bans[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1181919][color=black][b]LevelUp[/b][/color][/url] was vacation banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451][color=black][b]Yellows[/b][/color][/url] was banned for DDoSing members.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121196][b]Natha[/b][/url] was banned for DDoSing members.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1070150][color=#383838][b]tdog0403[/b][/color][/url] had his account closed.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=432503][color=black][b]Deanie[/b][/color][/url] was vacation banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1140865][color=black][b]serg06[/b][/color][/url] was banned for being a Grammar Nazi.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=187420][color=black][b]Reblue[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=772964][color=black][b]Callum.[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=333869][color=black][b]Fanatic[/b][/color][/url] was vacation banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1228258][color=black][b]Darken[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=918986][color=black][b]La Fama[/b][/color][/url] was vacation banned.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=279157][color=black][b]TxTriton[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reporting [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s post.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91531][color=black][b]ven0m[/b][/color][/url] was vacation banned.\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Awards[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][color=#0066FF][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/color][/url] received the Drunk award after photos of him crossdressing while drunk were leaked.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1617327][color=#FFD700][b]Google Expert[/b][/color][/url] received the YouTube award.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=923197][b]KyleWTF[/b][/url] received the Master Donator and Cool awards.\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][b]Group Leadership Changes[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/url] is no longer a leader of The Empire.\n[/list]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIgZ[/img][/align]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1114693][color=#FFD700][b]Keeper[/b][/color][/url] -

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649]DaL33t[/url][/font][/size][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: For the 128th edition of the HF News, we've sat down by the fireplace to have a chat with DaL33t. Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make before we continue?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for interviewing me today. Kohsti, Litespeed, Askaa, Legend, Pineapple, Marjinz, CarrotMilk, jQuery, Prince of Persia, Hades, stayplural... there's so many people I speak to, but that's off the top of my head. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Lots of people from Illuminati. How much are you involved in the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: This is a pretty long story, however, here we go. Recently after the group was formed, I was invited by BELLAGIO - I joined, of course. After lots of negotiations about who was going to be group leader (as well as BELLAGIO himself) I had to leave the country. I was inactive and was kicked out of the group. As of an hour ago, Kohsti added me back in. Interesting eh? So if anyone wants to join a REAL group, Illuminati is what you're looking for!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad you have a pretty nice history with the group. Why did you have to leave the country?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: Just some stuff that went down back in the UK. Nothing personal, but it's not really relevant. I live in Dubai now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Dubai is an awesome place. What are your interests on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: On HF, I enjoy just looking around, speaking to new people and selling stuff around the marketplace. I haven't been able to find any other marketplace with the capability of matching HF's.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: What kind of things do you sell?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: Currently, just a VPN. However, I'm looking into a few other markets and trying to see what else I could sell - I'm especially interested in finishing a project I started a long time ago but never got round to in regards to antivirus scanning ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do you code your products from scratch, or do you hire different people?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: All of my recent projects have been coded by me from near-scratch by using different libraries such as Twitter's bootstrap for CSS. However, I'm actually teaching myself CSS right now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How hard is it to learn the language?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: CSS doesn't seem too hard, but that's probably because I know some other similar languages. It's just about getting the feel of the language.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad to hear you're having a good time with that. What other languages do you know?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: I know a bit of pretty much all useful languages. PHP is my main language. I know some Java, HTML/CSS I've become prominent with, C#, VB.Net, C and more...\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: How long did it take to learn those?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: Let's just say, a really long time. I started off mainly with Java (I used to run a few RuneScape servers), but then I realized that I like PHP more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Do you still play RuneScape, or have you lost interest in it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: I never actually played RS. I ran servers, but never played the real game properly - the only times I've been on there is to sell/buy RS gold or interact with customers of mine.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Awesome to hear. That's all the time we have for now... any closing comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=303649][color=white][b]DaL33t[/b][/color][/url]: Just going to say: stop with the whining! Thanks :)\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473]Coffee[/url][/font][/size][/color][Spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: In this edition of the HF News, xadamxk has been freed from jail, and has made a new acquaintance. Would you like to make any shout-outs Coffee?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473][color=white][b]Coffee[/b][/color][/url]: Yeah, to Blackchaos, Morchid, Insidious, #Anthony, yourself,  and anyone else I've forgotten.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: You are known for your graphic talents around the forums, what ever brought you to that hobby?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473][color=white][b]Coffee[/b][/color][/url]: Back in 2007 I got my first iPod Touch, I jailbroke it and the first thing I did was download a theme. It had a few icons missing so I found out how to design them using Photoshop. I've loved it and continued to do it since then.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, I have seen several of your themed tutorials. What did you think about the jailbreak released just recently, called Evasion?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473][color=white][b]Coffee[/b][/color][/url]: Unfortunately due to a battery problem I've been unable to update to iOS6 yet and therefore have not used the jailbreak however, after keeping up with the news about it it seems like a very stable addition to the jailbreaking toolkit.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: That it is, bless those who have helped contribute to the community. Do you plan on contributing to the iOS community in the future, now that the 3rd party iOS world will be at it's peak? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473][color=white][b]Coffee[/b][/color][/url]: I most definitely will, I had a bit of an inactive period on HF recently through university and family stuff, but now I'm back I plan to resume posting in all my favourite places like 137. I'm also hoping to become part of a team which will benefit the iOS community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: It seems that several members, including yourself are returning to the iOS forums, which makes me happy. As jailbreaks release for newer devices, it seems that it takes the iOS Teams longer to develop a working jailbreak. Do you think Apple will ever make the iOS too hard to exploit?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473][color=white][b]Coffee[/b][/color][/url]: I think that they're definitely making it harder, after all it's been a long time since we saw a bootrom exploit, or a TIFF exploit (as per the first ever \"user friendly\" jailbreak) But as long as the programmers like pod2g and such are dedicated we'll always be able to find the exploits.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Indeed, maybe a new generation of iOS developers will begin to show themselves. Never the less, do you have any last words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91473][color=white][b]Coffee[/b][/color][/url]: Hopefully, I look forward to the future of the iOS community. And just that I'm glad to be back part of the HF community after my inactive period and I look forward to conversing with people I haven't spoke to in a while.\n[/Spoiler]",

Sadly there isn't much activity at the moment on the HackerCraft server, so there's no need for a segment dedicated solely to the events within it. This section will now house news regarding Minecraft, Hackercraft and related servers such as PlanetBeacon. Suggestions and feedback regarding this new segment would be appreciated.\n\n[color=white][b]Inactivity on [color=#9400D3]Hacker[/color][color=#32CD32]Craft[/color][/b][/color]\nActivity on HackerCraft has dramatically decreased following events leading up to many of the biggest factions being disbanded. Most of the regular players have quit the server, including former admins and moderators. They've all migrated to PlanetBeacon, a PvP-Factions server run by Dan. Many members blame [color=#00BFFF][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url][/color] for the server's lack of activity and claim that he had a direct hand in many of the server's biggest factions leaving, such as Chad and Wolves. Of course, [color=#00BFFF][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url][/color] was sick for a week and did not take any action related to the server during that period of time. He and Holynick claim to be working on reviving the server and Holynick has recently opened the buildworld, which brought a bit of activity from some new players. The server activity typically peaks at fifteen members per day whereas it used to peak at around fifty. \n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft Snapshot 13w05b[/b][/color]\nSnapshot 13w05b is out, although the changelog shows nothing but bug fixes. This snapshot is a progression release of Minecraft 1.5; the much anticipated Redstone update! The redstone update adds all kinds of new gadgets to the game, such as light sensors, weighted pressure plates, hoppers and more! This update will also bring a new lighting engine which should fix, among other issues, lighting glitches with stairs and half-slabs. Redstone wizards will have some fun new toys to play with once 1.5 is live. For more about the redstone update, click [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Update]here.[/url] To download snapshot 13w05b, click [url=http://mojang.com/2013/02/minecraft-snapshot-13w05b/]here.[/url]\n\n[align=center][b][color=white][color=#FFA500]Featured Server of The Week: [/color][color=#E0FFFF]PlanetBeacon[/color][/color][/b]\nPlanetBeacon, run by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113]Dan[/url], is this week's featured server! Featuring PvP-factions and players of the HackForums community, PlanetBeacon currently houses all the old players of HackerCraft. The server IP is:  play.planetbeacon.com[/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIiL[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]GTA V Delayed[/b][/color]\nRockstar Games announced that the newest title in the GTA series has been delayed and will hit shelves on September 17. It was previously targeted to hit this spring, however Rockstar came out and said the delay was to allow the company to further polish the game. Rockstar said, \"We know this is about four months later than originally planned and we know that this short delay will come as a disappointment to many of you, but, trust us, it will be worth the extra time. GTAV is a massively ambitious and complex game and it simply needs a little more polish to be of the standard we and, more importantly, you require. To all Grand Theft Auto fans, please accept our apologies for the delay, and our promise that the entire team here is working very hard to make the game all it can be.

The Call of Duty Championship, presented by Xbox, featuring a $1 million Call of Duty®: Black Ops II tournament, will take place in Hollywood, CA April 5-7. Activision Publishing, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard and their award-winning studio Treyarch, in partnership with Xbox®, Major League Gaming (MLG) and the Electronic Sports League (ESL) will bring together 32 of the world’s most skilled multiplayer teams on the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft to compete head-to-head in Call of Duty: Black Ops II in a live-streamed spectacular to be broadcast to the masses.\" You can view more event details and more by clicking [url=https://elite.callofduty.com/esports]here[/url]. \n\n[color=white][b]Latest Xbox Achievements (New Games)[/b][/color]\n[url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/gears-of-war-judgment/achievements/]Gears of War: Judgment[/url] - 50 achievements, 1000 points. \n[url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/bioshock-infinite/achievements/]BioShock Infinite [/url]- 50 achievements, 1000 points. \n[url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-3/achievements/]Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3[/url] - 50 achievements, 1000 points.\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Game Releases (February)[/b][/color]\nDead Space 3 - February 5\nAliens: Colonial Marines - February 12\nMUD: FIM Motocross World Championship - February 12\nOmerta: City of Gangsters - February 12\nCrysis 3 - February 19\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance - February 19\n\n[align=center][color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color][/align]\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbS15ZaUig[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIjc[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Possibility of US-Iranian Talks[/b][/color]\nUnited States Vice President Joe Biden publicly stated that the US is open to talks with Iran concerning their enrichment of Uranium. The current sanctions on Iran are some of the hard-hitting sanctions history has seen. However, Joe Biden asserted, \"But we have also made clear that Iran's leaders need not sentence their people to economic deprivation and international isolation.\" Negotiations in the past have been a dismal failure, but President Obama believes that direct talks with Iran's leadership would make things potentially more successful. The talks are likely aimed to keep an explosion from happening in the middle east and Israel, should Iran develop nuclear weapon capabilities.\n\n[color=white][b]25 Killed after Mexican Explosion[/b][/color]\nAt Mexico's state-run oil company in Mexico City, an explosion occurred which resulted in 25 deaths and 101 injuries. Many people were unable to get out of the exploded building; they were trapped inside. Overall, the explosion that occurred in a building basement had caused two floors to crumble. The government is unable to conclusively determine what caused the blast, but the attorney general is investigating. Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, Pemex comptroller office attorney, stated, \"People were screaming. ... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground.\" Paramedics, officers, helicopters and paramedics all raced to get the survivors out of the exploded buildings where they were trapped.\n\n[b][color=white]Egyptian Presidential Palace Assaulted[/color][/b]\nThings have been heating up in Egypt, and the latest assault on the Egyptian presidential palace by protesters is climactic proof of that. Molotov cocktail, rocks and other similar material were violently hurled at the palace's security forces. State news had even captured video of security forces assaulting a naked man. Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations explained, \"The continued attacks suggest a real breakdown in central power, we're coming close to that...none of the political forces have control over the people in the streets.\" This is only one incident of an on-going violent protest against President Morsy.\n\n[color=white][b]Muslim Extremists Destroy Ancient Artifacts[/b][/color]\nOver the years, there has been a growing number of incidents where extremist Muslims are destroying cultural artifacts. Most recently this week, over 2,000 manuscripts located at Mali's Ahmed Baba Institute were ruined. Experts on this issue point out that this is the desire to get rid of idol worship or rather the worshiping of false gods. While most Muslims are tolerant of these artifacts, there are Islamic extremist organizations who do show this behavior. Usama Hasan, an employee at U.K.’s Quilliam Foundation, stated, \"It’s very sad. You lose all that cultural heritage, music, history, art, ancient books. If they (Islamists) don’t agree with what’s in them … they seem to think it’s okay to burn these books.\" \"If you’re not Muslim or don’t subscribe to the same narrow interpretation the militants do, they will oppose everything you do and do so violently if they need to.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIjC[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nThere hasn't been anything special with Apple this past week. However, The Evad3rs have released their Untethered Jailbreak for iOS6 this last Sunday, Feb 2nd. The jailbreak is known as 'Evasi0n' and its homepage can be found [url=http://www.evasi0n.com/]here[/url]. If you're looking forward to jailbreaking your device, you can look at the tutorial written by MarkMare and xadamxk about using the tool, which can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3218214]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Twitter[/b][/color]\nTwitter posted in its blog that a recent attack may have compromised about a quarter million of user's accounts. Afterwards, they suggested that their users get a new, stronger password. Quoting them, \"This week, we detected unusual access patterns that led to us identifying unauthorized access attempts to Twitter user data. We discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later. However, our investigation has thus far indicated that the attackers may have had access to limited user information -- usernames, e-mail addresses, session tokens, and encrypted/salted versions of passwords -- for approximately 250,000 users. As a precautionary security measure, we have reset passwords and revoked session tokens for these accounts. If your account was one of them, you will have recently received (or will shortly) an e-mail from us at the address associated with your Twitter account notifying you that you will need to create a new password. Your old password will not work when you try to log in to Twitter.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Samsung[/b][/color]\nReports say that the smartphone giant, Samsung, will make a huge announcement later this month. It's expected to be about the next version of their Samsung Galaxy S series, the S4 smartphone. Samsung released its S3 last year, in May. Having shown a lot of growth over the past few years, they are the toughest competitor for Apple. The release of the S3 made quite a downfall in Apple's iPhone market, but the iPhone 5 saved them with a leap back up the ladder. With lots of patent battles between these two giants, which resulted in the ban of the S3 being sold in U.S, Samsung will try to regain their sales with the S4. \n\n[color=white][b]Sony[/b][/color]\nSony has decided to unveil its newest video game console, the 'Playstation 4,' this February 20th in New York City. Sony has sent invitations to the press regarding their unveiling. Journalists says that Sony will work not on the hardware part of the PS4, but rather, on how to interact with the players more than PS3. It's expected to go on sale later this year. Many have suggested to go with AMD chips over Sony-IBM-Toshiba of PS3. Well, Sony has added a small clip with its invitation, that can be seen below:\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-3GMHIgR-U&feature=player_embedded[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIjS[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Mel C and Jack Dee Almost Killed By Crocodiles[/b][/color]\nActress and singer Mel C came close to being drowned and eaten by Crocodiles with comedian Jack Dee, after an attempt to raise money for the UK charity Comic Relief. They were paddling in the Zambezi river in Africa, which is notorious for its large number of crocodile and hippopotamus inhabitants, both of which can cause serious danger to human life. The Kayak they were initially in capsized and they ended up entirely helpless in the water. She said the experience was \"really scary,\" and that \"It was probably the most terrifying situation I've ever experienced.\" When they were eventually rescued, the two changed their vehicle for improved safety and they finished their journey in rafts without any further incident. They are hoping to have raised over $1.5 million after the end of their trip for the charity.\n\n[color=white][b]Mariah Carey 'Stares Into Space' When Nicki Minaj is Talking[/b][/color]\nMariah Carey has been reported to be blatantly ignoring her fellow American Idol judge Nicki Minaj, whom she sits directly next to. The two have been known to fail to get along well, especially after the incident in which Nicki famously gave Mariah Carey a tongue lashing when they both disagreed over a contestant on the show. Recently Nicki confirmed she was sure that Mariah Carey does not like her, and this is suspected to be true from alternative sources. An insider told the Heat Magazine: \"Whenever Nicki has something to say in meetings, Mariah completely ignores her and stares into space.\" This in turn aggravates Nicki, especially when she attempts to speak as Mariah will turn her head off to the side in order to isolate herself from what is said next. One time in particular, after an argument between the two stars, Nicki allegedly had threatened to 'shoot' Mariah. Although Nicki denied this, Mariah admitted to hiring extra security in the days following the comment. The bosses of the show are worried that the two will be unable to work together in the future and they are unsure as to which move Mariah may take next.\n\n[color=white][b]Nervous Adele Needs Comforting from Boyfriend[/b][/color]\nSinger Adele has reportedly been incredibly nervous in the days leading up to her Oscars performance, where she will perform her song Skyfall which has been nominated for the 'Best Original Song' category. After giving birth to her baby on October 2012, she has been anxious about public appearances and so she needs her boyfriend to calm her down. A private source has confirmed: \"They speak all the time and, when she's feeling stressed, he just tells her how beautiful she is and how lucky they are to have their beautiful baby.\" Simon Konecki, her boyfriend, has been encouraging Adele to spend the majority of her time in the US as the event approaches. He has been persuading her to go out and enjoy her time in LA while she is there, even though he is aware that she prefers to spend most of her time at home, in private, with him.\n\n[color=white][b]Music video of the week[/b][/color]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Otla5157c[/yt]\n\n[color=white][b]User suggested music video[/b][/color]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx0rApSk6w[/yt]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/1XIkm[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nGod damn.\n---\nWell, it's out.
