The ban comes as coronavirus has been ramping up in China and is now spreading at a faster pace globally. British developer Ndemic Creations said, “We have some very sad news to share with our China-based players. We’ve just been informed that Plague Inc. ‘includes content that is illegal in China as determined by the Cyberspace Administration of China’ and has been removed from the China App Store. This situation is completely out of our control.” Ndemic Creations is working on bringing the game back to China but is facing difficulties as this is not an easy process to keep the game unbanned. Many players are hoping that the game will be brought back as it has helped some of them deal with the virus.[i][size=x-small][url=<br />https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51673293] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Spot is on the Move[/color][/b]\r\nSpot the dog is going to land a new career.

The company said more robots will be put in place in the future and will assist with oil operations. Massachusetts police have also recently added Spot as an extension to their bomb squad, which Spot is capable of many scenarios for any situation.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a30872342/spot-boston-dynamics-norwegian-oil-rig/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Happy Birthday Raspberry Pi[/color][/b]\r\nRaspberry Pi celebrates its eighth birthday (February 29), thus adding double the memory to its base model and holding the same price of $35. Currently, the Raspberry Pi 4 offers “40 times the CPU performance and eight times the memory” compared to the original Raspberry Pi that was released in 2012. The company is delighted that they had achieved the goal of being able to sell a $35 Linux desktop, “When we were first started talking about Raspberry Pi 1 Model B back in 2011, we were very clear about what we were trying to build.” This price reduction will be permanent from now on, and it is not clear whether the 1 GB Raspberry Pi model will retire with this price reduction for the latest model.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/raspberry-pi-birthday-price-cut/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/gamingnews-redsox.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]'GTA Online' gets competitive F1 racing[/color][/b]\r\nWhere does one even begin to describe the amount of activities that can take place during a single session of GTA Online?

The GPU is based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture, and the CPU is built on Zen 2. Xbox Series X supports up to 120fps.

A couple of editions ago, an article was written about the Anime Tourism Association having a special event for those that are outside of Japan to be able to visit the country, and even attend the AnimeJapan convention. Not only has the virus canceled big events such as AnimeJapan 2020, but the virus has caused cancelations for upcoming episodes of anime that are airing and even future anime that will be releasing in the spring season.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the last edition, there was a report on other cancelations, such as Bandori's major cancelation, where they had to cancel major events relating to their mobile games, new anime, and much more. This time, we have Bandai Namco having to cancel their Love Live! event. The coronavirus is getting out of control and it is very scary how much it is affecting things.

Everyone has their own favorite Pokémon, and there are many different reasons why we may choose a favorite. For instance, the look of the Pokémon might be cute and adorable. Another example would be that the Pokémon's personality is just like you. Well, most recently, a public vote was created to see who the best all-time Pokémon was. Some might think that the face of the Pokémon company, Pikachu, is the best, but you might be surprised with who the top three highest-ranked Pokémon were. At the number one spot, Greninja has won Pokémon of the Year. Geninja was able to win with an outstanding 140,000 votes. The runner up with 102,000 votes was Lucario. Surprisingly enough, Lucario was able to make a huge comeback, going from fifteenth place to third. Making their way into the third-place spot is Mimikyu, everyone's favorite Pikachu clone.

You might assume that because anime is so big in Japan, that anime has a huge influence when it comes to commercials, movies, tv, and more. This is true to an extent. What's starting to occur more are companies creating anime shorts to advertise their products. In December of last year, McDonald's made an anime short, featuring food from the Japanese region, most likely advertising a nice warm meal to eat after traveling in the cold weather. You can check that short [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OuW0RAmw9I]here[/url]. The latest anime short to be created for a company is by Apple Japan. Apple recently created a 38-second short anime film. Included in the short was snippets from different anime that some may know, such as New Game. The snippets had scenes where characters were using some sort of laptop, however, the laptop had the famous half-eaten apple logo that Apple is known for. You can see that video [url=https://youtu.be/V85CQzsyvj4]here[/url].

The book is about a man who is middle-aged and has a liking for a girl who is around twelve. How this relates to anime is the number of characters who depict younger girls. The majority of the time, the way to make this acceptable is by stating their age being over 18. However, this is not only the case. There are countless amounts of famous characters who are underaged and liked by anime fans. The South Australian senator Stirling Griff brought forth to the Australian parliament that anime depicting young girls in sexualizing manners should be reviewed. In most places, including Australia, you are not allowed to produce, possess, or distribute any pornographic material relating to children, even if it has to do with drawings. One of the anime under the radar in Australia is \"Eromanga Sensei,\" which depicts a solid case of incest as well as multiple underage girls interested in sexual things, such as genitalia, and much more. While this may be unacceptable elsewhere, Japan's laws state that when it comes to child pornography, cartoon characters, such as those in anime and manga, are exempt. What do you think of the matter?
