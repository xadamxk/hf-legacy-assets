To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://goo.gl/pxojJ][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://goo.gl/cA8RE[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has created a new section under the Marketplace - [b][url=http://goo.gl/y7k11]Premium Ebook Bazaar[/url][/b]. This section is for upgraded member sales only. It's mandatory that all e-books posted in this section be reviewed by the official Reviewers team. All new threads will be moderated; this means that once you submit your thread you will not see it until it's approved by a leader of the Reviewers team. [url=http://goo.gl/bm9lH][b]-BoodyE-[/b][/url] is the official moderator of the section. You can read the official announcement [url=http://goo.gl/KTosk][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is currently running a special offer for advertising on HackForums wherein an 88x31 footer image is priced at $25 per month. This is quite a deal with it being 50% of his original price. You can read more about it [b][url=http://goo.gl/LrWOY]here[/url][/b].\n\nThere was confusion and mild uproar over whether or not forum-specific moderators can bypass the minimum message length of 35 characters. This confusion was cleared by [url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] in [b][url=http://goo.gl/Ar7gi]this[/url][/b] thread. He stated that group moderators are not forum moderators, therefore they should follow the 35 character limit.\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated on his twitter that he has dismantled the [b]Malvager[/b] group and removed the IRC link at the top of any HF page. you can read his tweet [url=http://goo.gl/SXkfi][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] created the [i][b]Blizzards Battle.net[/b][/i] forum category with 3 sub-forums (World of Warcraft, Starcraft Series and Diablo) in an effort to make things more organized.\n\n[b][url=http://goo.gl/1c2Si]тнє Jσкєя[/url][/b] was disqualified for MOTM this August. [url=http://goo.gl/Lv8v9][b]Joey Tribbiani[/b][/url] won the MOTM for the month of August. We congratulate him on his wonderful achievement!\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made another youtube video this week entitled [i][b]Summer is Over, Back to Work, Back to School[/b][/i] which in he explains various things - from what he plans to do on HF to his philosophy on school and learning. It's a very intriguing video which you can watch [url=http://goo.gl/HF1Z1]here[/url].\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/cXOVH][b]xerotic[/b][/url] and [b][url=http://goo.gl/IlcIQ]AsSaSs@iN[/url][/b] are no longer part of the Staff at HackForums. Both of them have now been allocated the position of a Mentor. [b][url=http://goo.gl/IlcIQ]AsSaSs@iN[/url][/b] resigned to focus on his studies. Currently, the reason for [url=http://goo.gl/cXOVH][b]xerotic[/b][/url]'s demotion is not publicly known.\n\nLast week, the HF News suffered an attempted hostile takeover. [b][url=http://goo.gl/kQNfV]Cobalt+[/url][/b] handed the news over to [url=http://goo.gl/PHefi][color=#4DD0FC][b]Judge Dredd[/b][/color][/url] after much harassment. After realizing his mistake, [b][url=http://goo.gl/kQNfV]Cobalt+[/url][/b] tried to recover it. Eventually, [url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made a new group [b][color=white]Writ3rs[/color][/b]. this group controls the HF wiki, help docs, and most importantly, the HF News. [url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has stated that he will be making an official statement soon. The only people in this group at the moment are [b][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/b], [b][url=http://goo.gl/ctCKH]itylernallen[/url][/b], and [url=http://goo.gl/XSV0p][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]. We at HF News hope to see what will become of this group and HF News.\n\n[align=center][img]http://goo.gl/0zRhM[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=45246][b][color=white]Valiant[/color][/b][/url] accepted the newest batch of HJT Members, good luck to them!

Although reported as a 7.2 scaled shake at first, the [url=http://goo.gl/hCXcM][color=#FFDAB9]USGS re-evaluated[/color][/url] to a 6.8, and issued a potential tsunami warning just to be on the safe side. But it turned out to be a small  of a wave on the coast of the community of Atka. Because the earthquake was quite far away from the shore, minimal damage was caused by it and the residents of AK could sleep peacefully the rest of the morning.\n\nThey may be Anonymous, but they're definitely not unknown. In a bid to react against the recent activities of the hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec, suspected hacktivists have been arrested in separate parts of the UK. According to a news report; Amazon, PayPal, the CIA, US Senate and the UK's Serious Organized Crime Agency have all suffered either intrusions or denial of service attacks, designed to take their websites offline. \nApparently, these arrests are the efforts of a mass roundup involving UK law enforcement and the FBI. So its safe to assume the US is also in cahoots here. \nFor more details regarding this, you can check out the article [url=http://goo.gl/u6t23][color=#FFDAB9]here[/color][/url].\n\nThis Friday was probably one of the most exciting events in FPS gaming history with the grand opening of the COD XP convention, which was a convergence of fans around tie world both new and old to the Call Of Duty franchise. The event was held in Las Vegas, USA on Sept. 2 and continued on Saturday as well. The main reason why many of the gaming legends like Hutch and Sark were out there was for the Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer preview and the $1,000,000 COD Tournament. The event was concluded with USA's Team Optic taking home the grand prize.
