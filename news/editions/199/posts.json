At the time of writing, the price seems to still be in decline, now reaching under the $0.005 dollar mark - effectively making omc-rates.com display the value as $0.00. Cryptic was, however, quick about improving the accuracy of the calculator, to show members that the coin still isn't completely worthless. Hopefully new features will soon bring the currency back up.\n\n[b][color=white]Wallets Giving Peace of Mind[/color][/b]\nSince the major Omnicoin heist, users have been looking for a secure alternative to the multitude of online wallets. This has brought up the demand for locally signing coin wallets, keeping the coins separated by user and out of the hands of the server owner. This should bring new users peace of mind, as neither the owner of the service, nor any potential intruders, will be able to withdraw funds from wallets using the same principle as the one with blockchain.info. IcYSeptember recently [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4282082]showcased his upcoming wallet service[/url] which will hopefully resolve the security issues and rebuild confidence in the coin.\n\n[b][color=white]Dripping Coins[/color][/b]\nHackforums has been about earning money for a long time, but as usual, members come back to repay their debt to the website and its users. This becomes obvious with the range of newly opened omnicoin faucets, providing newcomers with an easy way to earn their first coins and play around with the currency.  This solution is particularly popular with the users owning lower-end computers, or users in bad financial conditions who are unable to buy or mine the coins.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yVoOuuj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white][u]Entertaining Threads[/u][/color][/b] \n\n[color=#333333]---[/color][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4277356][b]Don't fuck with Omni[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][b][color=#99FF00]xVulnerable[/color][/b][/url]\n[color=#333333]---[/color]Omniscient makes an example out of a user over just $20, banning his account and leaving the user's dox in his signature.\n\n[color=#333333]---[/color][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4288204][b]The Drunk Adventures of Tibit [Now With Audio By Eternal.][/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][b][color=#00AAF1]Tibit[/color][/b][/url]\n[color=#333333]---[/color]There are some things in life that simply cannot be explained.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] Hey 630, I'd like to give huge shout-out to The Gamer and Doxicity for being EPIC and to all Brotherhood members!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I always see you rocking Brotherhood's userbar, what exactly does the group do now? It has changed a lot since I was in there.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] True, The Brotherhood was the first group I was recruited to, It's my favorite group. I've been in The Brotherhood for quite a long time now, I think about 7 months. When the group had been divided in to multiple sectors I was recruited into The Brotherhood RAT team. Sadly some members in my sector started to be inactive and it was decided to close the sector. Still I do not regret the great experience and friends I had made in that sector, one of whom is Doxicity. The group's purpose is to help one another by posting high quality posts and tutorials. Current sectors are doing a great job their tasks right now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I miss my spy squad days, those were some good times. So tell me what made you choose your username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly I leeched the idea from xvisceral . Then changed it to xVulnerable because \"Vulnerable\" sounded like l33t heckers would use you know?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I feel you. So what do you do outside the forum? Any fun hobbies you like to do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] I play tennis around 4 times a week, im in love with the sport. I consider myself pretty good at it as I play against the top players in my tennis club in tournament matches. I like going out with friends, mostly clubbing on Saturdays. Apart from that, it's internet all the way. I'm a huge internet addict. When I have nothing planned for the day I literally spend from when I wake up till i go to sleep browsing the internet on my Laptop, and maybe I give my PS4 a go but that pretty much it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I don't know too much about tennis, but I find the sport extremely challenging. What games do you play on PS4?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] It certainly is, professionalizing the sport requires daily training and practice. I mostly play COD Ghosts & FIFA 14. I also give Runescape a go PKing when i'm bored. (Oldshcool Runescape)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Not a big fan of ghosts personally, I just recently got back into BO2. Are there any upcoming games you're looking forward to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] I used to be a PRO in BO2 back in the days when I used to play on my PS3. I heard about Watch Dogs, I've had friends telling me it's great and some telling me it's bad. I don't know...but the IRL trailer was so EPIC though check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJNOaPfw-q0\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I've been watching that as well, just not sure if I can make a game switch just yet after I invested some money in BO2 with the maps and camos. So how do you feel about the recent OmniCoin craze? Do you have OMC fever?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] It's a genius idea for Hackforums considering the huge marketplace this place has so props to Omni and the OMC team for that. I'm no crypto expert though, I remember I had invested in some OMC as soon as everything was official hoping they would rise in price due to high demand but shit they went so low in price I lost everything I had invested in which was about a hundred dollars. Since then I promised myself I would never invest in a cryptocurrency again.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] I first joined HF to learn how to setup a RAT to hack Runescape accounts, I was pretty good at it. I had no intentions of staying active at first but then i realised what a great community there is on this forum. I had learned so much from this forum and it's a nice place to make some money if you're smart enough too.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So you've got the brony award... Was it worth being branded as a brony and losing $100?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] Meh, $100 is nothing compared to how much I make from this forum. And hey, it's a colorful award. Who doesh't like one of those?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I had it and removed it... Too much color for me. So what do you do on the forum to stack all this cash.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] Really? Haha now that's a waste! I sell multiple products and services here on HF. I personally believe I have great marketing skills, I know how to market a product, on HF atleast. My most sucsessfull service is my RAT Mentoring service where I offer my time to those who are new to the ropes of RATting and wish to learn from an experienced user.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So how would you rate your overall HF experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] Defo 10/10. I've been active on many forums but I have never had a great experience as I had on HF. There are 2 types of people here, skilled users that actually know what they're talking about, and wannabe 15 year olds that have no clue on what they're doing. There are people who make good tutorials here such as myself and that's what attracts people to visit this site which is why the forum is always growing. As I said before I learned so much here, and I have yet to learn more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could change one thing what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] I would ban money making Ebooks from being sold, the amount of scams you see is a disgrace. I would allow Ebooks to be sold, just not money making cause there are actually a few legit Ebooks here and there but money making ones are scams guaranteed.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree. I feel 99% of eBooks are shit and the section has too many fake vouches. Well that's about all the time I've got for this interview. Any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][color=white][b]xVulnerable:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for having me, if you're feeling bored check out my site http://xvulnerable.com and have a laugh!

(You know who you are )\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] How did you discover HF? What persuaded you to register?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Discovered HF throughout a computer game. Minecraft to be exact, actually. I was running a server back in the day and I caught a player who was using xray and flying all over the place and I didn't know how he was doing that -- so I asked and he provided me with a link to the forum and I promptly signed up and used the site primarily for leaching Minecraft clients. After a few months I was growing bored of the same old stuff in the griefing section and then I saw what else the site had to offer and stayed. (I've talked about it more about it on my feedback thread that I've made in the past http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3672403)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Have you learned anything about computer security since you're registration?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I was more into Apple computers when I originally signed up so I only ventured into the section for them. I've learned the very barebones of security and keeping safe on the internet. (for the most part) I'm planning on spending time into learning more about it in the near future. (Chief & Aura, I'm looking at you!)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Awesome. Do you personally feel as if Apple products are over priced? Or do you feel that the rice is justified for what you're receiving?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I use both Mac & Windows and I believe that the price of Macs are justified because of the type of quality you receive when you purchase one. (Just my opinion) Bottom line is: If you can afford it, go for it! It's definitely worth it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I agree. When you're not on HF, masturbating, or playing LoL what are you doing?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I do what every teenager does, for the most part -- hang out with friends that are girls and have a good time every single day, no matter what. Especially now since summer recently started rolling on in. I've been trying to get back into photography and bodybuilding again as well. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] How long have you been body building for? Do you have any advice for the members of HF that are looking to get into shape for summer\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I was steadily for about two years or so. I had to take a year long break because of an injury that was followed up by a surgery and a recovery process that took way too long. Yep, sure. Watch what you eat and eat good foods -- not junk. Easiest and simplistic way to put it like that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Do you have a special lady in your life?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Not at the moment, free agent right now. Ya know? Had one for a few years and we recently just split to do our own thing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I see. If you could change one thing about HF what would it be and why?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'd like to see reputation getting handled officially sometime in the near future.  Other than that everything is damn well perfect.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I couldn't agree more. Do you feel RDCA has what it takes to be staff?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Definitely. I knew eventually he'd end up getting either staff of mentor soon. He's a responsible dude and I give him props for that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Do you hope to become a Mentor or a Staff member one day? So you can contribute on a higher level?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I think being a mentor some day would be pretty cool, definitely.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#DDA0DD]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] How has your position with the Writ3rs affected your overall HF experience?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Being a Writ3r has actually been a pretty fun experience throughout my time here.

Do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Clark is a better interviewer than me.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Welcome to the 199th edition of the HF news. This time 'round we're joined with the legendary HF interviewer, Clark. What's up dude?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] Hello Clique, thanks for putting off this interview until the last second.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Well I'm glad you feel that way. Anyways, to start off with -- any shoutouts before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] I'm going to attempt to list everyone. Sir, Saturday, RDCA, Harlem, Clique, Baghead, Grin (for teaching me how to write), eiqhtworks, Yellows, and a big fuck you to all of the newphs in the writ3rs except Feynman and Devour\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What's your opinion on RDCA being promoted to Staff? Do you believe that he's fit for the task? I think that he'll do great.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] Without question, though it would appear that he accidentally gave me a warning. He's still new at this, and accidents happen.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Why don't you send him a message about it? He's a very understanding[size=xx-small] (and cute)[/size] type of guy.  Anyways, how'd you stumble upon this great site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] There were a few reasons; Python help, cheap XBL, and Clique.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Did you ever get into the sales of Gamertags? Do you still program in Python? What other languages do you know?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah but the market's awful now. Everyone's so bloody shady and the children have ruined that forum for me. Not so much Python anymore, I focus primarily on web design/development. I know HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C# and Python.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  True. Do you have a life outside of the forum? What do you do in your free time?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b] No.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Very interesting, moving on. What are you driving right now? Pretty sure it's something like a cavalier or something similar to that, right?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] Honda Civic Si, which happens to be the fastest car on the forums.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Gorgeous car, dude.  Anyways -- what do you think of the recent expansion of the news? Are you happy with the influx in members?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] No they're all pissing me off.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] They'll grow on you eventually. What does an average Friday/Saturday night look like when Clark the King is around?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] I ask women out on dates but they keep saying no so I generally hit up HF to keep the newphags in check. A job best suited for eiqhtworks.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True. I miss that little guy, I hope he still reads the news here. Any advice for newbies that front up here on HF?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] Try to help others out. Forums should be used as learning tools (amongst other things) IMO, and there's tons of resources on HF. If you come across a question that you're able to answer, please do so. Provide a detailed response including as much relevant information as you can. It sets an example for everyone, especially the OP.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Real talk. Do you think that HF will be around by the time you're a father?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] I hope so, and I hope to be active for years to come.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Preach. Any finals words before we wrap this up?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]:[/b][/color] Stay quality HF.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, I'd like to make a shout-out to my noobs in The Empire. Especially that noob Freddy/Body.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] What was it that initially brought you to join Hack Forums and what has kept you here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I was brought to this site by coincidence, was looking around for a song that I couldn't find the name of. The rap & rap battle section kept me in the beginning, from there I discovered more parts that fascinated me..\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Being a rap fan, I'm sure your name Jake Miller comes from the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Miller_(rapper)]rapper[/url], correct? You must be a big fan of his.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] I am a huge fan of Jake Miller. I've followed his journey from the beginning and have seen him grow into what he is right now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] You are a Hack Forums member living in Denmark. I'm sure the majority of the community has never been to Denmark, myself included. Could you describe what it is like to live there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Well there really isn't much to see in Denmark. Our main attraction is Copenhagen. The society here is very modern yet everything looks so retro.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Much of your activity here on Hack Forums is in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=128]SRPP[/url] forum. Which of the four subjects (science, religion, philosophy and politics) interests you the most?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Religion is why I got into the SRPP section. The main reason is that The Empire once had an debate team ran by Evangelist. I've learned a lot from the section and can proudly say I've outdebated my religion teacher.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Do you consider yourself a very religious person? What sort of beliefs do you have regarding this topic?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not a religious man at all as I'm atheist but like most atheists I do know a bit about every religion. If I was to turn to a religion it would probably be Satanism.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Do you believe that living in Denmark has helped to shape your views at all? From my understanding, Christianity and Islam are the two most common where you live yet church attendance is fairly low.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Well I wasn't born in an overly religious family. Everything I know about different religions is what I've learned from the internet, school and the SSRP. I wouldn't say Denmark has affected me at all.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] What sort of personal hobbies do you enjoy and participate in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Dog training. I spend several hours a week training with my dogs teaching them tricks. It requires a lot of patience to maintain a dog's training. I also train myself; I used to train at a gym but now I just train at home.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] A lot of training going on in your life I see. Which do you find more rewarding-- Training dogs or training yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Dog training, but I can't complain about the benefits a well trained body has on a public beach.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of beaches, my research has told me that Denmark is a country where it's fairly common to see topless women. What are your thoughts on whether or not women should be able to legally do this worldwide?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] There's not as much as people say. But to answer your question, public nudity should be allowed everywhere from the hip and up of course. I don't see why it shouldn't be legal and think people should be able to go to a beach and get a tan on their breasts.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] I agree completely. Is there anything we did not talk about today that you'd like to bring up and discuss?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] I don't think so.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952870][color=#2E64FE][b]Alien:[/b][/color][/url] In that case, thank you very much for your time and responses. Both the interview and the conversation were enjoyable.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1616077][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jake Miller:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed it was, peace out HF.[/spoiler]",

Though, a light of shining hope has appeared now that the United States House has passed an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act 2015. Basically, what this is doing is removing funding for this type of invasion; however, it does not make it illegal for them to do it. The idea that our own goverment is making faulty products with security holes designed into them is an extremely worrisome thought on multiple levels. For one, it allows the government access to our personal data, and it posses a massive security flaw which can possibly be used by anyone. The New America foundation had sent a letter to the House earlier in the week, urging this bill, and saying in part, \"Both of these measures would make appreciable changes that would advance government surveillance reform and help rebuild lost trust among Internet users and businesses, while also preserving national security and intelligence authorities.\" This non-profit coalition often takes strikes at the NSA, and is backed by companies such as Google. \n\n[b][color=white]Windows 8 Problems in China[/color][/b]\nRecently China implied on its national TV station that Windows 8 could be stealing Chinese personal information. Realistically Microsoft is getting in the middle of the crossfire of the ever growing cyber war, and they're taking aim at the American based company claiming that it can identify people, their accounts, their contact lists, and use this information to help perform cyber espionage. Microsoft is striking back saying it has never \"assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients,\" \"concealed any requests from any government for information about its clients,\" or provided backdoors into their software. China is using the entire NSA scandal as a leverage point to create propaganda and to attack big American businesses. \n\n[b][color=white]Security Tip of the Week[/color][/b]\nOn Android mobile devices, whenever you install a new software it tells you what it can and cannot modify. The simple fact is that some apps demand full permissions when they do not need it. In my honest opinion, this is a huge read flag. People need to be aware how many apps they're giving full access to, as it is creating a massive security problem. There are two places you can see which apps have access to your Google account, first online and secondly, via your smartphone. Newer updates include a special setting called Connected Apps under Google Settings.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=751152]Vazity[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=878768]SomeWhiteGuy[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Bolivia's Central Bank Bans Bitcoin[/color][/b]\nEl Banco Central de Bolivia, the central bank of Bolivia, has banned any currency or coins, that are not regulated or issued by the government, including Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies such as Peercoin, Namecoin, Quarkcoin, Primecoin and Feathercoin. They went on to say that citizens are prohibited from using any kind of currency that is not ussed or controlled by a government or authorized entity. Sebastian Serrano (CEO BitPagos), told that such an announcement would do little to encourage the startup community and prohibit Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies from helping those in the country, who could benefit from economic freedom.\n\n[b][color=white]500,000,000 Dogecoins Mined in a Malware Attack[/color][/b]\nAn unknown hacker has mined an estimated 500 million dogecoins, which is worth nearly $200,000 USD at the current rates, by hacking into a series of data storage hubs, according to SecureWorks. The report revealed that the hacker had targeted boxes made by the Taiwan-based Synology Incorporated and used its power to mine Dogecoins through a private pool. Several customers of Synology Incorporated has also reported in on Facebook that their servers had performance issues, which could be linked to this episode. To date this incident is the single most profitable, illegitimate mining operation.\n\n[b][color=white]OpenBazaar: Decentralized eBay with Bitcoin[/color][/b]\nWhat began as an award-winning concept for a P2P marketplace may develop into a e-commerce revolution. OpenBazaar is about enabling the exchange of products while not employing a risky centralized exchange. With a network unbound from interference from any authority, users will conduct business through OpenBazaar while not paying fees or maintenance costs. Overall OpenBazaar could offer a way for online buyers and sellers to avoid the risk of scams and focus on engaging in commerce without barriers.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[color=white][b]Earth and Moon are around 60 Million Years Older than Previously Thought[/b][/color]\nAccording to new research by European Association of Geochemistry, the timing of the giant impact between Earth's ancestor and a planet sized body occurred around 40 million years after the start of solar system formation. This means that the final stage of Earth's formation is around 60 million years older than previously thought. To find the date of Earth's formation, head scientists Guillaume Avice and Bernard Marty analysed xenon gas in quartz found in South Africa and Australia, which dated 3.4 billion and 2.7 billion years. The quartz acted as a time capsule of sorts for the gas, allowing scientists to compare the isotopic ratios of xenon to that of billions of years ago. \n\n[color=white][b]Air Pollution Linked To Irregular Heartbeat and Lung Blood Clots[/b][/color]\nAccording to a large study published in British Medical Journal, air pollution is linked to an increased risk of developing an irregular heartbeat, a higher risk of stroke, and blood clots in the lung. The evidence suggests that high levels of certain air pollutants are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular problems, but exactly how this association works has not been clarified. Over 400,000 heart attacks, more than 2 million emergency admissions for cardiovascular problems, and 600,000 deaths from a heart attack or stroke were linked to average levels of air pollutants over a period of 5 days using data from the monitoring station nearest to the place of residence. The study focused on several air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone. \n\n[color=white][b]Processed Red Meat Linked To Higher Risk of Heart Failure and Death In Men[/b][/color]\nResearchers from the American Heart Association showed that men who regularly eat moderate amounts of processed red meat such as cold cuts and sausage tend to have an increased risk of heart failure incidence and a greater risk of death from heart failure. Researchers recommend avoiding processed red meat and limiting the amount of unprocessed red meat to one to two servings a week or less. It was found that men who ate the most processed red meat (75 grams per day or more) had a 28% higher risk of heart failure compared to men who ate the least (25 grams per day or less). The study followed more than 37,000 people over 12 years. Almost 3,000 of those had heart failure, 78% of them ate more than recommended amounts of processed meat.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Twitter Adds Embed Tweets to Mobile App[/color][/b]\nTwitter has released a new interesting feature for its users. This new feature is for the passionate retweeters of twitter. On the latest update for the Android and iOS twitter app users have the ability to embed tweets in your tweets. That’s right, it is like an inception of tweets. It may be a little bit more confusing though for the people who are used ton just straight out tweeting. The feature works by copying and pasting others tweets into your composed tweet. This feature is quite annoying since your followers cannot see the embed tweets on their computer. It is certain that this new feature will stay and it is most likely an experiment by twitter. This new feature isn’t widely used and overall takes double the effort to make a tweet.\n\n[b][color=white]Canadian Supreme Court rules internet anonymity is key to privacy[/color][/b]\nCitizens of Canada can now officially be free and anonymous online. However, for all you blackhat hackers they will still prosecute hacking related crimes if police get a warrant to investigate your accounts. So that means all of the internet’s finest trolls and flamers can freely rage at each other in YouTube comments. This ruling of internet freedom came down after Matthew Spencer was convicted for possessing child pornography. Now police must have a warrant to ask for information on user accounts, and cannot peek at a person's details by request. The Supreme Court of Canada believes that anonymity is a key component of personal privacy and encourages people to live a free life online. Obviously, law enforcement is upset with the ruling since they have to process more warrants, but this is a crucial step on the road to an open web.\n\n[b][color=white]The FCC is looking into Netflix's issues with Comcast and Verizon[/color][/b]\nFor months Netflix, a popular online movie streaming service has been talking about internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon. Netflix claims these ISPs have manipulated deals that they “forced us into for adequate service”. Finally, the FCC has decided to investigate this case. Early discoveries in the FCC investigation propose the question, whether or not consumers are getting what they’re paying for. Each ISP questioned has so far provided excuses and blamed each other for the slowdowns. Comcast stated that they have “\"long published our peering policies.” Meanwhile, Netflix stated that “Americans deserve to get the speed and quality of Internet access they pay for.” I wonder what ISPs will be exposed, and how this will affect Netflix long term.\n\n[b][color=white]Samsung Suggested That Next \"Note\" Phone Will Have Quad HD Display[/color][/b]\nSamsung has unquestionably created a smartphone empire with its Galaxy series. It seems everyone loves it, and that begs the question, where will Samsung go from here? We got an answer as to what is happening with the next Galaxy Note, quad HD display. Samsung has hinted at the next phone in the Galaxy Note line will be quad HD, with the resolution being about 2,560 x 1,400. This means that the phone will have even sharper visuals than the current lineup. There aren't any other details about the phone at this time, other than that it will keep the current 5.7-inch screen.\n\n[b][color=white]Truly Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds Recharge In Your Pocket[/color][/b]\nBluetooth has become sort of synonymous with wireless audio recently, with everyone making Bluetooth speakers, headsets, as well as earbuds. Beats have released Powerbeats, but they are not truly wireless, having a cord that stretches from one earbud to the other. Earin looks to solve this though, with their completely wireless buds, which they also called Earins. The buds are powered by a dedicated battery in each, and will last about 3 hours on a charge. You may think that 3 hours is a very short time, well, good news for you then because they come with a tube that allows you to place the buds in and they will recharge themselves using their own battery. The whole setup fits easily into your pocket or purse so you can take them with you wherever. They are very close to their goal on Kickstarter, and if you happen to back them for £99 ($170), you secure yourself a pair to be delivered by January 2015. If you would like to check out Earins, click [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1629248706/earin-the-worlds-smallest-wireless-earbuds]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Toyota Shows Off Led-Lit Concept Car With Customizable Hood[/color][/b]\nToyota is showing off new concepts for their Camatte, which if you can remember showed up about two years ago with interchangable panels. They have added a new level of customization to this version, though. You can translate images to the nearly 7,000 LED lights on the hood, so you could use practically any image for it. Anything from your child's drawing to art of your own to some random image you have lying around. This could big in the development of the Camatte, seeing as everyone is crazy about custom things nowadays. There is no real word on if the LED's will reach the final version, or even how much they will cost, but it's speculated that a complete LED hood would be rather expensive to say the least. Check out the latest concept video below.\n[sp][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxJvrmNkMaE[/yt][/sp][/align][/spoiler][/align]",

According to them, the touch control of the Wii U Gamepad and the 3DS would allow Minecraft to reach a wider audience than ever. In Takashi's words, \"We've always thought internally that using the GamePad would probably make for a Minecraft that's very easy to play. And, of course, if we were to do something with Minecraft on the 3DS, similarly we would probably do it where it would be easier to play and could probably reach a lot of kids.\"Their focus for a possible Minecraft port is to make it appeal to as many users as they can. This does not seem to be an obstacle, however, but rather an opportunity. \n\n[color=white][b]GTA V I'm Not a Hipster Update[/b][/color]\nOn June 17, 2014 a new update for GTA Online was released which is called \" I'm Not a Hipster.\" This new Update provides a number of new Vehicles, two new Weapons, and a host of new outfits, hairstyles, tattoos, and other cosmetic enhancements. The I'm Not a Hipster Update is a free DLC which makes it even better. You can find all of the features and contents that's included in the link to the news on official Social Club website.\n\n[color=white][b]University Now Offers League of Legends Scholarship[/b][/color]\nRobert Morris University-Illinois has announced on its website that qualified League of Legends players can now receive scholarships for college to play the game. RMU has now became the first college to ever offer such scholarships for Sports athletes with this announcement. Students who qualify can receive up to 50 percent of tuition and and up to 50 percent of room and board costs covered by the aid. RMU has also created a Varsity League of Legends team along with the establishment of the scholarship which will be competing with other colleges in the Collegiate Starleague. ther participating colleges include Harvard, George Washington, and Arizona State. Teams from the United States and Canada compete for the North American Collegiate Championship, a League of Legends tournament organized by developer Riot Games. Winners receive $100,000 in scholarships from the tournament. It is likely that more colleges will follow the decisions of RMU in the coming years. Either way, this will certainly fuel the debate of whether or not eSports should be considered a \"real sport.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Grand Theft Auto V to ’take full advantage of the power of PC’[/b][/color]\nAccording to the official steam page of the game, Grand Theft Auto V \"will take full advantage of the power of the PC\", when the game is launched for the PC later this year. The PC and Next-Gen version of the game will feature numerous enhancements, including increased resolution and graphic detail, dense traffic, upgraded AI, and greater draw distances. In addition to these enhancements, the game will feature new wildlife, advanced weather, and more damage effects. As expected, all downloadable content for the Xbox 360 and Play Station 3 versions for Grand Theft Auto Online will be included in the Next-Gen and PC versions of the game, this includes Jobs, weapons, vehicles, properties, and character customizations.\n\n[color=white][b]Nordic Games has acquired the THQ trademark, will publish under that name[/b][/color]\nAccording to a report by Polygon, Nordic Games has acquired the THQ trademark and will reportedly publish under that game. “It was kind of a surprise to some industry veterans and players that we were the were the winner of the auction of the THQ titles,” general manager Klemens Kruezer told Polygon. “The challenging fact is nobody has ever heard about Nordic Games before the THQ auction. There were so many articles with the headlines ‘Who the fuck is Nordic Games?’ We said, okay they were right. We have seen an uplift in the name of Nordic Games, and what we also have done is we have made a second deal with THQ where we bought the THQ trademark.” Nordic Games was one of the few companies that acquired portions of THQ's properties when the company went bankrupt earlier last year. Properties include Darksiders, Red Faction, and the MX series. A MX vs ATV game is expected later this year by the company and they are expected to continue the Darksiders series. \n\n[color=white][b]Release Dates for the Week of June 14, 2014:[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]EA Sports UFC - Play Station 4, Xbox One - June 17, 2014\n[*]Pushmo World - Wii U - June 19, 2014\n[*]MotoGP 14 - PC, Play Station 3, Play Station Vita, Xbox 360 - June 20, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[color=white][align=center][sp=[b]Gaming Video of The Week[/b]][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQPyXVJDnSc&list=UU__Oy3QdB3d9_FHO_XG1PZg[/yt][/sp][/align][/color][/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/D8fNJCn.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft News: Final Edtion[/color][/b]\nAfter a year and a half and 77 installments, the Minecraft News is, unfortunately, being retired. Originally HackerCraft News, it was created to inform players of happenings on the then popular HackerCraft server. After it died, the HackerCraft News was rechristened Minecraft News in order to cover the game as a whole. For a time the Minecraft News was focused around Planet Beacon, a server that attracted the Hack Forums community and acted as a substitute for HackerCraft. Later on, the news gradually grew smaller and smaller as Planet Beacon died. Months later HackerCraft was reopened and revamped; the server saw an influx of activity from old and new players alike, but it only lasted for a few months. Following this, HackerCraft was revived only to die again multiple times; in May,[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#ff66ff][b] Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] decided to close it permanently. The permanent closure of HackerCraft unfortunately means the closure of the Minecraft News. While there are still community events, active servers, and frequent snapshots and updates, there is unfortunately not enough site-relevant news to necessitate a whole section devoted to Minecraft. Minecraft related news will still be featured from time to time in the gaming section of the news, and Minecraft enthusiasts can find development updates on Mojang's official website. Over its lifespan, the Minecraft News was written by three sole writers: [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][b]Phytrix[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227][b]Lovol[/b][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][b]Baghead[/b][/url].

Iraq has been covered in violence for many decades but since 2006 the deaths each year have been slowly decreasing but Sunni jihad militants have now exploited the anger of Sunni Muslims against the Prime Minister and the government and are now marching violently with the death toll rising above 2013, so early in the year. The militants have an estimated 150,000 fighters marching, while Iraq have close to 200,000 in the army alone, so on paper Iraq outweigh the force but the militants continue to gather the support of the people and with force of arms there is signs of a civil war soon to erupt. America have already deployed a carrier in a bid to help prevent the violence and are close to stepping in.\n\n[b][color=white]French President Caught In Affair[/color][/b]\nFrench President Francois Hollande has reportedly been caught having an affair but what makes the situation even worse is that where he was caught having the alleged affair was at a Corsican mafia run apartment. The name on the rental lease is of Michel Ferracci who has had a suspended-sentence of 18-months for money laundering, Ferracci has links to the Corsican mafia. This all comes off the back of news that Hollande's partner being recently hospitalized and when asked whether the report was true he refused to comment but did say that the report causes: \"violation that touches a personal liberty.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Man Found Eating Love Rivals Heart[/color][/b]\nA man in South Africa has been arrested on claims that he was caught eating his ex-girlfriends lovers heart.

The grizzly attack took place in a Gugulethu township near Cape Town and Western Cape Deputy Police Commissioner, Sharon Jephta has said police have offered any of the witnesses and the lover counseling due to the gruesome scene.\n\n[b][color=white]Canadian Escapees Captured[/b][/color]\nAfter a several week long manhunt, three Canadian criminals have been captured. The trio escaped from a detention center in Quebec by boarding a helicopter that landed in the middle of the rec yard and then took off, leaving guards and authorities baffled. The men were arrested early Sunday morning, and now they are right back at the very same detention center. Involved in the apprehension were Quebec City police and a SWAT team. \n\n[b][color=white]Pope Excommunicates Mafia[/b][/color]\nOn Saturday, Pope Francis declared that Italian Mafia members are excommunicated from the Catholic Church. “Those who in their life have gone along the evil ways, as in the case of the Mafia, they are not with God, they are excommunicated,\" Francis said. This means the members of the mob are no longer welcome in the church. The Pope has spoken out against the Mafia, even telling bosses that they are on a road straight to hell. Speaking on the mobsters use of unemployed youth as pawns, he said “They must be told, NO!” to a crowd of over 100,000 gathered in Piana di Sibari, Calabria, for an outdoor Mass.[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ndzWS1q.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1624866]Muzzy[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1161771]#Beau[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]PSY x Snoop Collab Live[/color][/b]\nThe man responsible for one of the largest music hits in the entire world - and YouTube's highest viewed video - PSY launched his new single this week, featuring iconic rapper Snoop Dogg.

Interviewed Sheeran said that he was attending a \"passover dinner\" with Usher, when he was called to attend a studio session and work on the track. Only time will tell how it pans out.\n\n[b][color=white]Uh-Huh Honey[/color][/b]\nRick Rubin, producer of Kanye Wests my recent album \"Yeezus\" has told BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe that he's \"Looking at vocal ideas\" for Ye's next album; giving a final confirmation that he will make a return.
