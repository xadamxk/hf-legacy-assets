These tools are a possibility, ranging from HackForum's own \"Text Editor\" to \"Resolvers\" and more. We do not know much of these tools, but [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] closed [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3721144]the thread[/url] and claimed, \"For now I have a decent list to get me started on this.\" There is no estimate on when these tools would be released, but [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also stated \"Don't hold your breathe on this.\" It seems that these tools would be open for \"[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3721144&pid=34888196#pid34888196]ub3r/3p1c[/url]\" upgraded members only.

[i]\"Movies, Films and Cinema\"[/i] has retired and up holds the [i]\"Movies, TV, and Videos\"[/i] section. This section welcomes the posting of YouTube videos and episode discussion; hopefully now some control will be brought to the videos posted in the Lounge.

The Lannisters was popularly titled from HBO's Game of Thrones. Not so long after the group was branded and set up, it was changed again, because of the high demand for the past gaming group it was known for, \"Legacy\". Once more, the invite-only gaming group returns.

It seems that group owners have complained one too many about the flooding of requests to join groups through the [url=http://hackforums.net/usercp.php?action=usergroups]Group Memberships page[/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] decided to change the plugin's function for this issue. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] did not remove the function entirely for the belief that less abuse will go through the \"Join Group\" function if it is limited to upgraded members only.

We will talk about the changes Illuminati is going through as well as some other things that might be interesting about him. Anon, is there anything you wish to say before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: Thank you for taking your time to interview me and I wish you the best of luck with MOTM. I would like to give a shoutout to the teachers of Legion who're doing an amazing job to pass on knowledge to the Legion students along with making sure things are running smoothly within the group while I'm spending time on Illuminati. In addition I would like to thank Bugga, mad, Perfect Cell, LulzCat, Inclination & Understalker for being amazing persons - they know why.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Thanks. What brought you to Hack Forums? Did you expect to be such a successful marketer when you joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: I most certainly didn't. I joined these forums merely because the name appealed to me. I had been hacking with smaller groups for quite some time and thought I might as well try my luck on a larger forum. I studied marketing in college and quickly saw the potential for selling within the marketplace; my initial goal wasn't actually to earn from my products, but merely provide a quality service at an affordable price, and so I started with a VPN service which grew in popularity quite rapidly, from there I simply moved on to other products and I've got half a dozen pending projects.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Tell us about your experience owning two official groups on Hack Forums? Is it a lot of work and is it worth it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: I purchased what's now known as Legion almost a year ago and the time with this group has been a rollercoaster. Illuminati was purchased not long after in the beginning of 2013 and it has too been a special journey. For a long time I didn't run the groups alone - I was concerned that it would take too much time, which would result in me running both groups poorly -, so I had leaders overtake different roles. I've now been running Legion alone for several months and things have settled quite nicely with a lot of helpful teachers who do some of the boring work, so that I can spend time on more important tasks. I now feel like I'm in a position where I can run both groups by myself. The groups requires work and attention, but it's always a pleasure to drop into the subforum and see all of the tutorials that has been posted. The friendships I have with the members are indeed something that makes up for all the work.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Tell us about the changes you will be bringing to the Illuminati group.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: As I had my attention on Legion, I had others try to run Illuminati, but it became obvious that things wasn't run correctly and that something needed a change. Therefore I decided to revamp Illuminati and turn it into something I don't believe we've previously seen on these forums: an exclusive club for the absolute elite businessmen. The previous leaders tried to have an applications thread, but it didn't turn out as expected; I'm tired of lying kids with no online income who tries to lie their way into the group, furthermore I also believe it's only right that all of us who profit from our activities on here give back to the community one way or another. Due to this I decided to add a paid monthly membership to the group; this 'barrier' would ensure that only those who actually earned something could get into the group and also guaranteed that the members would give back to the community - as the payments from this membership are used to fund our monthly 1000 USD contests. An important factor that makes this different from other \"buy-in\" groups is that I'll personally look through everyone who wants to pay for membership, and I'll solely accept the absolute elite businessmen - I've already denied half a dozen members as I didn't think they were of high enough quality to be apart of this exclusive club.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Let's talk business. What projects are you running right now? Tell us about them.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: As always I'm selling my black hat services, but enough about that.\nProducts I'm selling on-site includes stresser, VPN and a miner, but I'll be selling a lot of other products in the near future such as hosting, Resolver API's, Crypter, Scanner, RAT along with other spyware and possibly LegionOS if everything goes as planned.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do your online and offline life go hand in hand?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: I feel like a very lucky person, because my job is in fact my hobby. I make a living from my online activities, which mean I can stay at home everyday and plan my schedule however I want; This is great as it gives me a lot of time to spends with the kids and the fiancé - and I think they appreciate it just as much as I do. Sure I'm up late from time to time when things are burning hot or when I gotta meet a deadline for some BH job, but whenever I do work I'm at home and not absent like I would be if I actually had a 'real' job. I greatly appreciate how my friends and partners bear with me when I'm spending time with my family - it's all about prioritizing correctly and I'm pleased to see that they know what's more important.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any small tips you'd like to share for the aspiring marketers who are reading this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Αnonymous[/b][/url]: Praise every dollar earned because it's just one step on the road to becoming a great marketer.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFA600]Connected[/color][/b][/url]:  Thanks so much for sharing all this information with us, Anonymous.

Today we get to interview the popular member, leader of the official group Skill, and now the brand new Halo Section Moderator, Starstruck! Before we begin, do you have any shoutouts to anyone out there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]I'd like to give a shoutout to Platinum, Vinnie', Glassy and all of my Skill members. you guys are great. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]D: I see how it is! No love for Xypher. :c Back to my corner I go. So what first brought you to the world of hacking as well as HF itself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]Don't be sad ;-; Hahaha. I am a notorious Halo gamer, but one day I was playing some MLG and a couple of my buddies kept talking about Hack Forums this and Hack Forums that. After hearing them talk about it so much I figured I'd check it out. At that time the Halo section was booming and there were a lot of extremely active and competitive gamers. It's kind of died down lately, but I've been working very hard over the past 2 years to keep it alive and well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Well your hard work seems to have paid off what with you being the new Halo Section mod and all! But before I get into your recent promotion; you've had multiple username changes over the users, but you seem to always go back to, \"Starstruck,\" what inspired it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]I've used the name Starstruck as an alias for over 5 years now. It started back in my mid-late teenage years. I wanted a name that indicated fame and fortune, something that identified who and what I want to be. In life everyone wants success, but not everyone reaches it. I personally am willing to do what I have to do to be great, to be Starstruck.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Well you certainly have reached a level of fame and success here on HF. I'm sure you'll be able to accomplish that anywhere else you try. ^-^ So as of the past couple of days you've recently been made the moderator of the Halo section here on HF. How'd that all go down? I'm sure Omni PMed you about it a bit before hand.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]Actually no, as most people know you are not supposed to ask or recommend yourself of anyone else for moderation or any specific positions, they are to be earned. All I did was simply express my interest and aspirations for the Halo section to Omni. The section barely got attention from Staff and Mentors and it became a playground for trolls and flamers, it needed to come to an end. After showing my commitment to the section and it's members as well as gaming overall, Omni gave me the chance to prove myself by making me the moderator of the section. I'm very grateful and I'm glad he has given me a chance to show my potential on the forum. I will go ahead and warn members, do not attempt to seek any form of power the same way I did, I wouldn't be surprised if he usually just tells people to fuck off lol.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's pretty amazing. You have shown massive dedication to that section, so I'm sure I speak for many when I say that I'm not surprised you were chosen for the job. Now, other than gaming; what hobbies -on and offline- do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]My real life is pretty occupied, I'm a father and aspiring to be a musician. I have 2 babies in my life, first being my beautiful son and the second being my guitar. I love to go camping out at Kentucky Lake, drink some beer and go fishing. Pretty much just the simple things in life. On-site my other hobby would have to be graphics design. I was a member of Graphic Masters and Fly By Night, but had to leave the group due to a lack in activity during a rough time in my real life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Oh wow, you sure have quite the busy life. What type of music do you listen to and play? :o\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]I couldn't really say I have a particular style that I listen to or play, but if I had to pick I guess I would go with punk and classical music. For some reason classical music has always seemed to be able to calm me down, and punk music seems to hype me up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's Amazing. I'm a huge fan of classical, it fits all moods in my opinion. Have you thought of joining Fly By Night's music program? From what I've seen, they've got some very talented musicians in there.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]I was invited to Graphic Masters to assist with the Music Program, I wasn't labeled as a student or a teacher. I believe I was intended to be the Acoustic Guitar mentor or something. I was invited before Fly By Night was officially created. Due to leading a group and several devastating things happening in my personal life I was unable to maintain activity in the group and eventually was removed. There were no hard feelings, Fly By Night is a quality group full of amazing talent and it was a privilege to be a part of it. Hopefully some day when my schedule isn't cluttered I'll have a chance to be a part of the program again.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Hopefully that day comes soon as well. :3 So you moderate a section, you lead a group, you're a family man, how do you keep sane through all of that? I'd go nuts if I had that much on my plate.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]It's simple, I turn to my music. Most people only learn songs they enjoy playing and don't show any diversity, I play something different just about every time I pick up my guitar. It's where I can express myself openly without people realizing that I'm letting out any anger or sadness that I'm feeling. For most people, music is a hobby, for me it's a way of getting through life. Through the roughest times and my darkest days, I always find the inspiration I need to overcome anything simply through the power and calmness my music gives me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's good to hear. Having a way to escape from reality is always important. 😉 Have you ever thought of pursuing your music career past it just being a hobby and a way to escape?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]Yeah, but finding a band is the problem. I've stood in for a set as the bassist for the Wish You Were's at a house show. That's the furthest it's gone so far because nowadays taking care of my son is my highest priority.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That must have been a truly wonderful experience. Hopefully as your son grows up, you'll be able to spend more time on it. Maybe even he'll be able to pick up an instrument. :3 Sadly, it looks like we're all out of time. It was wonderful interviewing you and getting to know more about your love for music, Star! Do you have any advice for members reading this?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck: [/b][/color][/url]Be who you are instead of what people want you to be.\nYou cannot succeed if you fear failure. \nStrong words to live by, if you follow them you'll be happy in the long run. Thank you for takin the time to interview me. 🤝\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]And there you have it folks. That was a wonderful interview with the new Halo Section Moderator and quality member, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=900087][color=white][b]Starstruck[/b][/color][/url].

However, the 'Xbox On' command will only by available in 5 regions at launch. Microsoft said they are trying to deliver the best quality voice control for the Xbox One, which can take some time. Voice control will be available in more regions in the future, but an exact date has not been revealed. \"Our vision is to bring conversational voice control and voice search to every country where we sell Xbox,\" a Microsoft representative said. \"At Xbox One launch, we will offer voice control in 10 of our 13 launch markets, with eight total languages: English US, English UK, French, Spanish MX, Spanish ES, Italian, German, and Portuguese. There will be some voice experience variations in different markets at launch; the 'Xbox On' voice command will only be available in five markets (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany) and will come to others in the near future.\" \"There are many complexities associated with delivering a great voice experience around the world, and we're working hard to add more voice features and more countries; we'll share more details in the future.\" The delay may be worth the wait, but how many people would actually use the voice control feature? Let us know by posting below.\n\n[color=white][b]Introducing, the Nintendo 2DS[/b][/color]\nNintendo has announced the Nintendo 2DS. It will feature two screens and two cameras, however unlike the 3DS, the device is not hinged which has caused a lot of hate. If you have a 3DS, you'll be happy to know that the 2DS is backwards compatible with 3DS games. Nintendo said that they are still committed to the 3DS and 3-D capability. \"It doesn't mean that we are not committed at all to 3D and that we don't think that's a really valuable, unique eye-popping feature for a lot of gamers,\" Moffitt told GameSpot. \"We just wanted to continue growing the installed base and needed to find a way to get to a price point that was more accessible for a broad swath of consumers.\" This new handheld console will launch alongside Pokemon X and Y in the United States and Europe on October 12.\n\n[color=white][b]PvZ 2 - Downloaded nearly 25 million times.[/b][/color]\nElectronic Arts, owner of PopCap Games have announced that the popular new release game Plants vs. Zombies 2 has been downloaded nearly 25 million times. Earlier in the month (August), the game reached 16 million downloads. EA also announced some other statistics about the game; 5.4 billion zombie waves, 10 billion plants planted and gamers have logged over 81 million hours in-game. These are some pretty impressive statistics... who knows what milestones the game will reach in September? You can download the game on iOS.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nGTA 5 is probably the most anticipated game this year. Rockstar Games recently released another trailer that will feature on TV. This particular trailer will debut during Breaking Bad. You can watch it now below.\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvoD7ehZPcM[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Better Biome Generating to Come[/color][/b]\nPrevious allegations and claims by Mojang have stated that they'd alter the ocean biome in addition to actually bringing more biomes to Minecraft. That being said, though, they've never actually stated how they'd do it until now. With recent news, it's said that oceans are to be much smaller (and thus generating more land). Minecraft developers had stated that the update is being pushed due to complaints regarding too large of oceans, too uneven/random biome generation, and not enough variation in general. It's said that such update will be coming to Minecraft in it's upcoming update, 1.7.\n\n[b][color=white]Mash-Up Pack Coming to Minecraft: Xbox 360![/color][/b]\nAfter the recent TU12 patch for Minecraft for the 360, a Mash-Up pack was promised to be released with it or shortly after. After a week, though, fans haven't seen any sight of it. On August 30th, however, a Tweet was made by 4J Studios hinting the pack's release in the upcoming week. \"We're looking forward to the release of the trailer for the first Mash-up Pack this Sunday! Thanks @hat_films :) #MinecraftXBLA,\" says 4J Studios. For those that don't know, Mash-Up packs are similar to that of resource packs for the PC, making the game's theme completely different (in terms of default skin, items, blocks, music, etc.), thus probably exciting many 360 users.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color][color=white]'s Return![/color][/b]\nAfter a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3713561]thread posted by Omniscient[/url] regarding the server's future was made, many users stated that they'd love the return/continue of it. That being said, Omniscient took people's opinions into thought and thus made [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3722882]a thread[/url] stating that the server would continue. In exchange for a free 100 slot server, as Omniscient stated, he'd honor a free paid-sticky for the user granting him said deal. In the thread regarding the server's return, you can see that he's also taken into consideration the much favored return of factions and PVP.\n\nFor the current moment (while things are settling in and as Omniscient sets them up), the server is now in beta. [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3725327]A thread[/url] was made regarding such, allowing users to connect freely while everything is underway. Due to past problems, he stated, the server will likely not use its old world and everything will be reset. As a positive, however, users who bought Pow3r in the past will be honored with such and receive it on the newer server.

The president came to the unexpected decision during a walk Friday evening with his chief of staff. In his statement, Obama condemned Assad's regime, describing the alleged chemical attack as \"an assault on human dignity\" that \"presents a serious danger to our national security.\" He had previously characterized the use of chemical weapons as a \"red line\" that Assad should not be permitted to cross. Obama pledged that any military involvement would be of \"limited duration and scope.\" Before saying Saturday that he would seek approval from Congress, the President made clear that \"we are prepared to strike whenever we choose.\" \n\n[color=white][b]Man Robs 3 Banks 48 Hours After Prison Release[/b][/color]\nA man accused of attempting to rob three banks in Bucks County, Pa., within an hour and a half had just been released from prison two days prior, and used his bail release form to write at least one of his demand notes, police said. Luke Radick, 26, of Howell, N.J. was arrested just a few hours after he robbed three banks. Radick allegedly presented a demand note ordering tellers to raise their hands and give him money. Investigators say this demand note was the one written on the back of his bail release form. He ran off after a teller handed him some money. Police along with the FBI Fort Washington office launched a manhunt for Radick and had him in custody by 3:55 p.m. On his way into an arraignment hearing, Radick told NBC10 he did it \"for the money.\" When asked if he was sorry he did it, he replied, \"No, I'm sorry I got caught.\" \n\n[color=white][b]Teen Sentenced to 3 Years in Delhi Gang Rape Case[/b][/color]\nAn Indian teenager was sentenced to three years in juvenile detention on Saturday for the December gang rape of a trainee physiotherapist, the first verdict in a case that sparked debate over whether India is too soft on young offenders. Police say the 18-year-old and five adult men lured the 23-year-old woman and her male friend onto a New Delhi bus where they repeatedly raped her and beat them both with a metal bar before dumping them on to a road. The woman died in a Singapore hospital two weeks after the Dec. 16 attack. Four of the teenager's co-accused are still on trial and face the death penalty if convicted. The teenager pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges including rape, murder and robbery. His trial was held behind closed doors to protect his identity and media were barred from reporting on any details of the proceedings. \n\n[color=white][b]Japan's Radioactive Ocean Plume Will Reach US Waters in 2014[/b][/color]\nA radioactive plume of water in the Pacific Ocean from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant, which was crippled in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, will likely reach U.S. coastal waters starting in 2014, according to a new study. The long journey of the radioactive particles could help researchers better understand how the ocean’s currents circulate around the world. Ocean simulations showed that the plume of radioactive cesium-137 released by the Fukushima disaster in 2011 could begin flowing into U.S. coastal waters starting in early 2014 and peak in 2016. Luckily, two ocean currents off the eastern coast of Japan have diluted the radioactive material so much that its concentration fell well below the World Health Organization’s safety levels within four months of the Fukushima incident.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Amazon Kindle Users to Expect a Refund?[/color][/b]\nDue to a recent lawsuit against Apple (along with a few other publishing companies) regarding the fix of eBook prices, any user that purchased an eBook from Amazon (from publishers including  Simon & Schuster, Hachette, Penguin, HarperCollins, and Macmillan) any time between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012, are entitled to a refund of anywhere between $0.30 and $1.32, as stated by the US Attorneys General. However, if there is no appeal in court (during its settlement in December), users will just simply not attain the refund. \n\n[b][color=white]New to Nintendo: 2DS![/color][/b]\nAfter announcing its $50 price-cut on their popular system, the Wii U, Nintendo announced that they're also releasing a newer product, the 2DS. The 2DS, much like the name suggests, will be similar to the 3DS (another handheld device by Nintendo.) However, as you can tell, will only offer games in two dimensions. The system will be priced at $120 and will likely feature popular (and probably retro) 2D games such as Mario, but in turn will also turn any 3DS games into 2D. Surely it's a restriction, but perhaps due to the price difference, some users might enjoy it.\n\n[b][color=white]Target's Response to Online Videos[/color][/b]\nTarget's new service, \"Target Ticket\", is said to be released in the near future, allowing users to buy, rent, and order TV shows, movies, and videos, similar to Netflix. Details about the service were released earlier this year, but nothing sufficient has really come out until recently. Target has decided to not release an official statement regarding the matter yet, but rather has said that they're just testing the service with a few team members. However, they have partnered with a popular company, UltraViolet, in order to further continue the means necessary to release the upcoming product.\n\n[b][color=white]Further Analyzing Your Performance?[/color][/b]\nA new app, Strike Social, was just recently released in order to further analyze your views (amongst other things) on YouTube. Best of all, the app is free and has a reliable interface that works well. Though it's free at the current moment, the company's CEO, McKenna, stated that as the service gets bigger, a premium version of such will be released, introducing further/more exclusive services. The site is still in it's \"1.0\", thus there may be bugs of many kinds, but it is expected and is not permanent. As of right now, over 100 data queries are searched amongst Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube to find out exactly where your views are coming from and how many there are. In the future, however, users can expect to see the release of advertising tools (which will likely be for premium) among other perks.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Miley Cyrus at the VMAs.[/color][/b]\nNothing new with Miley Cyrus, she's still trying hard to get rid of that \"Hannah Montana\" image she created as do most Disney stars (just look at Selena Gomez.) First she tried \"twerking\", then hanging out with rappers, and finally in her new song she mentions doing \"molly\" and cocaine. Well, she really stepped up her game this time by twerking, molesting an innocent foam finger and deciding to touch all over Robin Thicke, a married man with a kid all while doing this live, on national TV. To be he honest, it probably wasn't even her idea to do this. It was most likely her agent, who was once the agent of Britney Spears. Britney Spears once did a similar \"shock\" performance as Miley back when she was younger and got the same response as Miley Cyrus did. Massive uproar and media attention, which boosted her career. iit can be said that Miley was trying to get the same effect. As Charlemagne put it, \"Miley Cyrus Wanna Be A Nigga So Bad. She Swears She's Ratchet Pussy.\" The only thing left is a porno. \n\n[color=white][b]Kendrick Lamar Starts Beef with Fellow Rappers.[/b][/color]\nIt's about time for some competition and beef in the rap industry like in the golden age of hiphop. In Big Sean's new song \"Control\" from his album H.O.F, Kendrick disses Big Sean on his song as well as Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale, Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake, Jay Electronica, Tyler, and Mac Miller. Funny thing is, most the rappers not mentioned, decided to respond like Lupe Fiasco and sadly, B.o.B. Even A$AP Rocky mentioned how people not even mentioned are getting butthurt:\n[spoiler=]\n[img]http://24.media.tumblr.com/30846869127b00fc2be6ca2e036da37b/tumblr_mruhnhN3Kz1rrkbkqo1_500.gif[/img]\n[img]http://24.media.tumblr.com/e7388e6fcdc2a49620eeb09fab3c17f3/tumblr_mruhnhN3Kz1rrkbkqo2_500.gif[/img]\n[/spoiler]\nK.Dot even mentioned how he had to \"dumb down\" his lyrics due to the fact that his audience would probably not have understood his verse. That's just sad.\n\n[b][color=white]Eminem Releases New Song, \"Berzerk\".[/color][/b]\nEminem is taking it back with a 80's beat similar to the Beastie Boys. Straight from his upcoming new album, \"Marshall Mathers LP 2\" is sure to be a hit. Though Twitter was on fire when Em released the song with little prepubescent kids, who probably listen to 2Chainz and Lil Wayne. People don't like the unfamiliar and the unpredictable, which exactly why Em named it \"Berzerk\"; Kanye got the same reaction when [i]Yeezus[/i] was released. Another reason many didn't like it was because people don't want to listen to classic hip hop music with that boom bap rhythm. Eminem is doing what he wants, what he feels like. He doesn't need to put out a highly offensive song to get attention anymore; he already gets attention.\n\n[b][color=white]Pusha T \"My Name is my Name\" Cover Art Released. [/color][/b]\nOne of the most anticipated albums of the year is Pusha T's \"My Name is my Name\". With his recently single he released, \"Numbers\" proved Pusha T's new album was something to take seriously. With features from Kanye West, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and Pharrell, Pusha T's My Name Is My Name will be released October 8. He kept the cover relatively simple just like Kanye:\n[spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/FxOWYfX.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]Music of the Week:[/color][/b]\n[spoiler=]\nA$AP Rocky's new song for GTA5:\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOoDK1aUZn0[/video]\nThe music video of the week is dedicated to Eminem this week.\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkUvmDQ3HY[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nBudgeting. In this mainly capitalistic world that we live in, money really does make the world go 'round. Sometimes it can be difficult to budget your finances into categories of what you want and what you need. I'm not only talking about those who are living on their own and having to afford food, clothes, and shelter. Even those who live from meager summer job paycheck to paycheck while living at home or still going to school have budgeting concerns. When you start to enter the adult world, all of a sudden, your money has places it needs to be: in the bank or in the tank. Then, those few financial scraps that you can gather have to be divided between certain amenities to keep yourself sane. Personally, I had the cash to either afford a Chromebook for my upcoming classes or a few games that I had been interested in. While it was a tough decision, I decided to get myself the Chromebook and save the trouble of trying to get one later on. And whaddya know? You wouldn't be reading this right now if it weren't for that decision to purchase the Chromebook that I am currently typing on. Be wary of where you spend your money--what you want, may not always be what you need.",
