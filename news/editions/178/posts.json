Since early 2013, he has begun having occasional seizures and, after the continuous reappearances of these seizures, decided to pay the hospital a visit in order to find out what was causing these disruptions. It turned out to be a lesion in his brain, as determined by the results of a CAT scan and an MRI. At a mere 1.3 cm in size, it doesn't seem all that large but his neurosurgeon still believes that it is the root cause of the seizures. Even though medication against the return of the seizures helps, they also have strong side affects including severe irritation, affecting his culinary classes. Several other problems have also arisen over time, including light sensitivity and trouble concentrating. Viral Dragon has been a member of Hack Forums for over four years at this point, sharing his knowledge to others completely free of charge. Being a Mentor, he is relentless in keeping Hack Forums a good place to be. Now the roles are reversed; Viral Dragon is the one who needs help. On the [url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-my-love-diagnose-a-lesion-in-his-brain]Indie GoGo[/url] campaign started by his significant other, [b]iceybunneh[/b], several ways of how members can help out are described, from sharing his story on social media to making a donation, helping them raise $13,000 needed to diagnose the lesion and hopefully improve the quality of his life. \n\nLastly, I usually do not go first person when writing the headlines. In this situation, however, I make an exception. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=23809][color=#00AAFF][b]Viral Dragon[/b][/color][/url] is a leader, someone to look up to and learn from. Share his story, help how you can, let's make a change for the good. -Mohatu.\n\n[color=white][b]PayPal Holding: A Bannable Offence[/b][/color]\nIn a sudden turn of events, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has decided to disallow members from either using PayPal holders or offering to be one. For those unaware of what a PayPal holder is, it is someone who quite literally holds PayPal funds for another member who is either unwilling to use PayPal or has been banned from their services. This leaves both parties vulnerable: the receiver of the funds is likely to have to deal with chargebacks while the one using the services of a holder is never guaranteed to receive the funds being held for them. On several occasions, Hack Forums' members have awoken to PayPal balances in the negatives, often by several hundreds of dollars. In an effort to reduce this type of occurrence and cease young members from falling victim to debt at a young age, the practice has been decided to be disallowed entirely. There are, of course, members who may be angry at the change, such as stresser owners. However, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] advises those members, and others, that this change will increase the adoption of Bitcoin in the forum marketplace even more. An alternative to PayPal, Bitcoin offers encrypted, safe transactions that can not be disputed. The notification thread can be read [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4003472]here[/url]. Punishments as a result of attempting to use or be a PayPal holder after this day are in danger of having their account closed.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jSO3vt1bm2wTp.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1548093][color=#EFEFEF][b]Ηaze[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1617327][color=black][b]Google Expert[/b][/color][/url] both hit 1,000 reputation.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=716331][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cryptic™[/b][/color][/url] hit 2,000 reputation.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]News Notables[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=#EFEFEF][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url] snagged the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3997585&pid=37703682#pid37703682]first[/url] post in the 177th edition.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] caught the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3997585&pid=37721726#pid37721726]fiftieth[/url] post in the 177th edition.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#EFEFEF][b]Sir[/b][/color][/url] explains this new section in Sir's Second.

You should go for it.

Now that I've been here for a while I have moved more to the entire site rather than sticking to that one section.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad that you're exploring.

Do you think it's a distraction?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1568351]Devour[/url]:[/b][/color] I think it is overall good, but depending on how focused you are on it it can be a giant distraction and pull you away from real life.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True that. Any last words before we finish this interview?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1568351]Devour[/url]:[/b][/color] No not really anything else to say, just everyone reading have a good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102]Bullet.[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Hey, bud. Welcome to the 178th edition of the HF News. Today we're interviewing my old pal, Bullet. How are you? Any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] I'm doing good thanks for asking! I'd like to give a shoutout to my old friends 630, Cloudy, Soulmate, and Madness!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So what brought you to HF a few years ago?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] What brought me to HF a few years ago would be the free booters to be honest. I was young and wanted to \"hack\". I thought jays booter was the greatest booter ever. I thought I was a true hacker. But that went away quickly and I got into business.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] What type of business did you get into? I don't remember you selling much other than my first OG gamertag back in 2011.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] Well I had gotten into a few different types of investments and businesses.  It all started with selling XBL gold and Microsoft points with my partner Juicy. We sold them for almost a year. After that I moved onto gamertags, when I sold my first OG to you which I believe was the gamertag \"crossroad\", I sold them up until just last year. While selling gamertags I cofounded a booter for Respawn. But where I made most of my money would be on eBay. I manipulated one company to where I could make around $300+ a week. I couldn't spread my business over to HF as it would break the rules.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Was this before or after you e-married Queen? Also R.I.P. to her HF.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] Ahh! Queen, I met Queen around the time I was selling gamertags. We had a phase were we went on Tinychat and were all \"swagged\" up. We also made those ridiculous singing/dancing videos. And yes, R.I.P. to her HF. And for the record we never were e-married \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] It's super cool talking to you because it's like a time machine. So groups. Here is where you tell everyone about the Rhythm days and whatever other group mumbo jumbo you were apart of.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] Oh lord have Merci! Rhythm was one of the greatest groups here on HF. It was a family and a group to just have fun. I made many friends in that group. After that I got into The Empire. I had a great run with Empire until, well let's just say another member and I didn't get along so well. I got kicked from the group but was still friends with most of the leaders in it. After I joined Void, I wasn't very active so I left. Then I joined Respawn, made a bunch of friends, got leader, and got in a fight with Astonish and then left. Then I joined Skill, great group many skilled Xbox players. Then I joined The Brotherhood, I was in this group for quite a long time but then I had became inactive from HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] But Rhythm still is and was the best group HF ever had in terms of having fun. I remember how cool everyone was with each other. Hardly nobody didn't get along. Plus we had tons of fun destroying lounges and setting the standards for group activity.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] Exactly! It was the greatest group on HF and everyone had fun. At one point Every time I'd make a post another page had gone through. If I'm right we had the most posts in a group sub-forum on HF. Many might say it was LQ and spam. But all spam and LQ posts were deleted, everyone was simply having a large discussion on whatever topic was brought about. I miss those days, great memories.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I wish more groups today were as laid back. Everyone's so uptight these days and are forgetting we're on the internet. Speaking of groups, what are your thoughts on these newer groups and group changes?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] These new groups are too money hungry or are trying to be like other groups in the past. I think that all groups are the same, I haven't seen a new idea for a group for a whole. They are all based off the same ideas; gaming, monetizing, graphics, etc... It gets boring after awhile.  Groups are just over rated now a days, the only groups that I see actually do something for the community is the News Team, and the MRT.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's good to here. Let's not lie though, we've all had our dreams of owning a group on HF.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] You're right at one point in time I did want to own a group, but after becoming a leader of one I realized that it's way too much work and takes the fun out of everything. I'd just like to add that my neighbors baby is screaming and crying... It makes me want to jump out a window.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So moving on, I hear your friend just beat her cancer. That's awesome. My dad has cancer and I'm waiting for that day as well. Did you guys celebrate or anything?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sorry to hear about your father, my prayers go out to him an your family! And well we haven't had anything yet, as she is going through a few more chemos to make sure the cancer is gone. But when she's back in school, we are throwing a shindig for her welcoming back! Many friends and I are really excited for her to come back!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome. I can honestly say you're one of the most kindhearted people on the forums I've ever met and glad our paths crossed all those years ago. Well, do you have anything else to say before I end this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=950102][color=white][b]Bullet:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks Saturday, that really means a lot to hear from you. And I'm also glad we met, can't believe how long it's been. And I'd like to just remind everyone that you never know what's gonna happen in life, so don't waste it. And don't do drugs kids, stay in school.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283]Blowin Ounces[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to the 178th edition of the HF News. Today we're joined by the HF member Blowin Ounces. How are you tonight? Do you have any shootouts you would like to make before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] I'm doing great, thanks. No shoutouts to make, though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Alrighty, so right off the bat I'd like to talk about your homework service. What type of work do you handle? Why should people buy from you as opposed to others offering similar services?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] I pretty much handle any kind of work, with just two exceptions: foreign languages and maths. Not just specifically homework either, I'll accept almost any type of writing assignments. As for why one should choose me over similar services, I can think of a few reasons: my rates are reasonable and negotiable, I've received absolutely no negative feedback since I've started the service back in June of last year, I've never missed a deadline, and I always make sure that the work I deliver is of the best quality possible.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Solid reasons. that's awesome. So what inspired you to start that service?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] Well, actually, I got my inspiration from a number of other homework service threads that I saw while browsing HF one day. I looked through some of these threads and read some customer feedback and I took note of the few complaints people had. Either people were charging too much, or the quality was lacking, or they had a record of missing due dates. I figured I'd be more than capable of outperforming these other services and making up for what they were lacking, so I just started my own, and it took off from there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I see, well good on you for taking it upon yourself to help better HF! So tell us, how did you find HF? What made you register?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] That is a really good question, and I wish I knew the answer. I registered back in 2011, but I hadn't really used my account much until last year when I started randomly browsing through various sections, and eventually found the homework service threads that got me started on my own.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What's one thing you feel HF does really well?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] HF the website or more specifically its members?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] The community and or website.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] I feel that the HackForums web site itself does a great job in appealing to a lot of different interests, all of which collectively draw a huge and diverse set of members. While the main focus is obviously on hacking-related topics, I enjoy seeing HF also try to appeal to gamers, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, etc. One thing that I feel the HF community does really well is monetizing; more specifically, selling products and services. I am nothing short of amazed at what I've seen members be able to sell in the Marketplace and what I have even been lured into buying myself in the past.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What kinds of products have you purchased in the past?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] A pretty good variety of things; VPN subscriptions, server stress testers, a number of accounts for various online services. I'd say most of my transactions on HF have been currency exchances, though--usually between BTC and USD. My most regrettable purchases are always the eBooks, and I've come to promise myself that I will never buy another one again.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's a great promise to make. I myself have never purchased one as 99% of them are just common sense mixed with a semi organized layout. Do you have any future HF goals you'd like to achive?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] Yeah, ultimately I'd like to get more active, and also expand my Marketplace offerings. I'm gradually working on both of those goals.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good on you. What's one thing you'd like to see done different on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] Although I know Omni's said multiple times now that it won't be happening, it would be nice to see something done about all the scamming going on. I've been a victim of scamming myself and it bothers me that there isn't more being done about it. Browsing the Deal Disputes section can be pretty depressing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I agree, but it's hard thing to moderate and HF isn't a marketplace in itself. I say this all of the time but [b]SEARCHING UID's[/b] AND [b]CHECKING REPUTATION[/b] is essential before any dealing. Out of curiosity which HF theme are you using?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] I've always liked the Old School theme, so I've stuck with that. If that wasn't an option, I'd probably go with Modern Blue.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Yeah they're both nice themes. Did you get a chance to see some of the more modern user bars? what did you think?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] Yeah, definitely some really nice graphic design work there. I really like some of the custom groups' user bars; Innovation's and Complexity's would have to be my two favourites.\nhopefully i'm not confusing user bars with something else? lol\nhttp://x.hackforums.net/images/blackreign/groupimages/english/void.jpg that's what you're referring to right?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Correct. Innovation's is very nice. Anyway, I'd like to thank you for this dandy little interview. Do you have anything else you'd like to say before we wrap her up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=790283][b]Blowin Ounces:[/b][/url] I just want to thank you for taking the time to interview me and I'd also like to formally thank Omni for the great community he's brought together here on HF.[/spoiler]",

This may include being placed in isolated cheater pools or banned from GTA Online altogether.\" \"We're grateful for the community's continued support in dealing with these issues and once again apologise to anyone that has had their Grand Theft Auto Online experience sullied by these exploits that broke the game's natural flow. Please stay tuned for lots more news about GTA Online in the weeks ahead,\" Rockstar concluded. Rockstar is actively trying to make GTA Online a better place for legitimate players; however, heists are still a long way away.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft: No Halo Movie[/b][/color]\nA Microsoft spokesman has stated that there will be no Halo movie. \"The Halo franchise encompasses many elements, including games, action figures, novels and more,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer. \"As always, we have many projects in the works that offer us the opportunity to bring in new audiences to the franchise, as we did in the past with Halo Legends and Halo: Forward Unto Dawn. We plan to continue telling the Halo story through innovative channels, but there are no plans for a Halo motion picture at this time.\" The rumor shed light earlier in the week, but was debunked after a day. Microsoft is set to release the next installment of \"Halo\" later this year and production continues of the Halo TV series by Steven Spielberg. \n\n[color=white][b]Steam: 10 Million New Users In 3 Months[/b][/color]\nValve has announced the Steam service saw 10 million new signups in only three months. The PC distribution platform now has 75 million users overall.  Value also broke down sales per region in 2013, with North America accounting for 41 percent of sales, followed by Western Europe with 40 percent. Value announced these figures at the Steam Dev Days Conference.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nTotalBiscuit discusses early access on games with its consequences and implications. \n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGbbIB5eaM[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j5tt3ZeAOMRST.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot After Snapshot-- Minecraft 1.8![/color][/b]\nIn preparation for their next biggest patch release, Minecraft developers have been releasing snapshots on a consistent basis in order to allow users of the community to test new features, bug fixes, and commands. Not only have there been new blocks being added, but tons have been added to command blocks and plenty of bugs have been fixed. The patch, then, seems to be heavily in favor of mapmakers and entities they could use to furthermore make their creations better. \n\n[b][color=white]Name Changes in the Near Future?[/color][/b]\nA few months ago, Dinnerbone made [url=https://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/380795209665486848]a Tweet[/url] in regards to the future of name changing due to implementation of UUIDs for every Minecraft user. That being said, one can only assume that it's been being worked on. In one of the more recent snapshots, however, a bug fix was noted such that  \"[Bug MC-44468] – Using @a with scoreboard assigns things per UUID not name,\" only hinting towards the progression of such.\n\n[b][color=white]Skins Taking on New Meaning[/color][/b]\nIn the past, users were able to (in addition to their regular skin) add on an extra layer to their head region in effort for a more 3D effect. With that, developers-- in the newest snapshots (in preparation for 1.8)-- have made just that possible for every body region on a player. Skins will now be much more customizable and will likely be made on a much larger scale.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nThe server, as of late, has been up and running smoothly with few (if any) errors/downtime occurrences. The factions plugin, however, hasn't been installed yet and players have seemingly been doing fine without it.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]TBNR[/color][/b]\nIn the coming of the new year, the TBNR server has underwent a complete makeover. Not only has the hub design been altered in a unique and interactive way, but plenty of new mini games have been added in addition to the editing of those already existing.

Gilligan's Island aired from 1964 to 1967. He passed away in his home at the age of 89. Not only was he known for his acting on TV shows, but he was also known for his roles in old western movies as the villainous characters; they were always rude and never as clever as the the Professor he played. Some facts some of you may not know of: In the first season, they did not include Russell's name as well as his co-worker Dawn Wells in the opening theme. Russell has had appearances on various different shows, too, such as 'The Twilight Zone'. For all you Twilight fans, no, it's not what you think it is. \"I was always the bad guy in Westerns. I played more bad guys than you can shake a stick at until I played the Professor. Then I couldn't get a job being a bad guy.\" With that quote being said, he usually ending up being a character who was well liked and intelligent. Yes, villains can be intelligent, too, but he was classified as the good guy in these roles, such as in comedies and other drama shows. R.I.P.\n\n[color=white][b]Explosions in Bangkok[/b][/color]\nAs protesters round up around Bangkok, Thailand, they are hoping that their current Prime Minister will resign. The group was big at first, but is has been decreasing over the weeks. An occurrence happened not too long ago as well. Two explosions erupted in Bangkok. No one knows who set off the charges, but they wounded more than two dozen people. As the protesters marched throughout the city, the blasts went off from different directions. Over 20 people were rushed into the hospital. With around 12,000 protesters, a huge uprising has occurred and various acts of violence have came about. Authorities are supposed to respect the human rights of the protesters and make sure no one gets harmed. 20,000 officers and security groups have been sent out to stop anyone, anywhere. For the government this may be another issue because protesters seem to be coming more and more and in bigger groups. They are simply not giving up until Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra resigns.\n\n[color=white][b]Minister's Wife Found Dead[/b][/color]\nIndia's police have reported the death of Minister Shashi Tharoor wife. Reports have been said that Sunanda Pushkar, Shashi's wife, accused of her husband cheating on him. There is no current information on how she passed away. It is said that she, herself, hacked into her husband's account, impersonated him, and said he was having an affair with a Pakistani journalist. None of this is true though. It was all made up and all accusations were false. The journalist, Mehr Tarar, reviewed Pushkar's tweets. After a few minutes of reading most of them, she came to a conclusion that Pushkar tweeted crazy things that made her laugh. When the announcement of the death fo the Minister's wife went public, Tarar was in so much shock. She didn't know what to say; she was horrified and was feeling bad because they recently had a twitter fight and she died.\n\n[color=white][b]Dolphins Await Slaughter[/b][/color]\nFor all you animal lovers, such as myself, this is a horrible sight to see. Around 250 dolphins were rounded up by Japanese fishermen to kill them for their meat and sell it. There is an annual hunt for these dolphins in a secluded cove. Babies are split up from their mothers, families are broken, and it's a whole bunch of sorrow and fright for these dolphins. They are not killed instantly, but when they are trapped within the cove, they are usually imprisoned for LIFETIME. Some are lucky enough to escape, some are killed on the spot, others become frightened and panic to eventually become tired and cannot fight back. Next, they choose which dolphins they like the best. After that, they take them, slaughter them, and repeat the process for the other unlucky 'fins. \"Taiji dolphin fishermen are just conducting a legal fishing activity in their traditional way in full accordance with regulations and rules under the supervision of both the national and the prefectural governments. Therefore, we believe there are no reasons to criticize the Taiji dolphin fishery.\" The Japanese don't only practice this; they also practice whale hunting, which has often caused drama too.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jqIAAPcV7GZi2.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Intel's Bay Trail CPU Will Take Android To 64-bit This Spring[/b][/color]\nThis spring Android tablets will receive Intel's new CPU, which will bring 64-bit computing to Android devices for the first time. Intel's CEO claims that tablets running Google's OS will be soon receiving the Atom-based Bay Trail processor and will be launched into the world of 64-bit computing. These devices are said to hit as early as spring. \n\n[color=white][b]Unknown Sony Device Shows Up In Photos[/b][/color]\nA few pictures posted this past week show what seems to be a new Sony phone. The device has all the branding from Sony as well as what seems to be a few other features. The bottom of the phone shows the mic grille is three holes, and they have a lanyard hole on it. Many people claim this could be a new Z1 phone, and are expecting Sony to respond to these claims at MCW.\n\n[color=white][b]Comcast Discontinues AnyPlay And Preps Cloud TV Apps[/b][/color]\nIn 2012 Comcast released their AnyPlay service. This service was a cable box that made Comcast's live TV channels into internet streams so mobile users could watch from their device. They are now getting rid of this service in hopes of pushing people towards Xfinity TV Go, and other new services that will be possibly added later this year. The mobile app for AnyPlay will be removed from stores after March 31st.\n\n[color=white][b]Amazon Could Ship You Things Before You Order Them[/b][/color]\nAmazon is currently working on an idea which involves shipping an item to a specific area before it gets ordered. This idea is called \"anticipatory shipping\" and it will be used to reduce package transit times. As stated, Amazon will send a package out to a specific geographical location. After that they wait and if a customer orders an item matching the package, it is redirected to their home. There is no word on when this will be rolled out as of yet.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbsk2wRCmm4QLJ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]JB's boyfriend Lil Za Got Caught with Molly.[/b][/color]\nBieber got raided after there was footage of him egging his neighbor once police were inside they thought as first they had found cocaine but ended up really just being molly. According to TMZ, \"Sheriff's deputies have looked at TMZ's video of the incident and believe Justin has surveillance video that might have captured the egging. We're told deputies dismantled Justin's security system and took it during the search.\" This was a felony search warrant meaning feds is closely monitoring the Biebs. JB has also mentioned that Lil Za can still live with him after the drug bust. JB was also caught with lean. \n\n[color=white][b]Maddona Calls Her White Kid a \"Nigga\"[/b][/color]\nFirst of all she's white and then decides to call her kid, who is white too, a \"nigga\". She used the hashtag \"disnigga\" and what's even more funny is how white people began defending her for the use of it. Maddona first tried grillz, flashed her ass and boobs, now this? C'mon Maddona. \n\n[color=white][b]Kanye Assualted an 18 year old for calling Kim a \"nice person Lover\"[/b][/color]\nKanye West attacked an 18-year-old guy inside the waiting room of a chiropractor's office ... after the guy called Yeezy a \"nice person\". According to TMZ, \"Kim was at a Beverly Hills medical building when she was swarmed by photogs.  We're told the guy allegedly tried to help Kim get in the building, as he started screaming,  \"Fuckk these friend-ass friendly people\"\" -- referring to the paparazzi.  Kim then told him it was not appropriate to use the N-word.  We're told he then screamed at her, \"F**k you bitch.  Just trying to help you.  Shut up niggerr lover, stupid slut.\" Kanye punched the maggot and the kid has now filed charges. Pathetic.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbtobAO1a50qPD.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n-=-=-\n\n[color=white][b]News Notables[/b][/color]\nThis section of the User News is essentially news from the last HF News edition. \nOur goal is to boost HF News activity and quality beyond generic replies.\nOne can get a shout-out located here several ways.\n\n-=-\n\nThe first way to do so is to accomplish one of the following numerical posts: 1st, 50th, 100th, 150th, and 200th. (More will be tacked on if we pass 200.)\n\"1st\" is the first response to the HF News, whereas the others come from the [url=http://i.imgur.com/CXU6Vr4.png]actual post number[/url].\nPosts that are of low quality will be immediately disregarded and the runner-up will be chosen.\n[u]Do not delete your posts.[/u] There are plenty of chances to hit one of the target values, so assist the Writ3rs in boosting HF News activity. \n(I can also see thread notes. High volumes of deletion may lead to rule enforcement against spam. Don't be silly and get banned over a shout-out.)\n\n-=-\n\nAnother way is to respond both eloquently and intelligently. \nIf your posts stands out above the others in insight, quality, or thought, perhaps you'll be chosen.\nExamples could be ideas for the HF News, specific responses to the latest happenings, or personal angles on featured stories.\n\n-=-\n\nThirdly, major leaders of discussion.\nIf you get into a friendly debate with others on the latest news--from any section or topic--one to all of you could be chosen.\nFlaming and harassing will not be tolerated. Grow up and learn how to debate with integrity.\n\n-=-\n\nLastly, if you are able to get ten amigos to read and respond to the HF News--with a hyperlinked notification of your username included in their posts--you have a high chance of being chosen.\nExample being: \"#[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url]\" at the end of someone's post.\n\n-=-=-\n\nAll of this information will be included in the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1863762]HF News Explained[/url] thread.\n\n-=-=- \n\nDefinitely going to be adding the new content in February.\nShit I'm busy.",
