Welcome to this edition! Any shout outs you want to make before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks. Shoutout to Titans and Writers.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Let's proceed! What is it like leading the HF News? Is it hard?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] It was hard at first, I didn't know how anything really worked. I was in Writers only for a few editions before I became leader so took time to understand and get used to the process. But as I got settled in, it became easy and currently at a stable position as leader of Writers. Many think it's easy and I thought so too, but it definitely takes effort to run it but it's a fun position to have and I enjoy it. Helping the community is my goal.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking about the community, you recently added a feature in edition 241 that allow members to write their own articles. How is that going to work?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] So the new Moment section will allow community members, regardless of their profile status (Ub3r, 500+ rep, etc.), to writer their own articles. I made a thread asking for suggestions a while back and most of the suggestions revolved around the ability for members to create their own articles so here it is.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Can a member write more than one article for each edition? What if dozens of people start writing articles, will you be able to fit it all in the news?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] Members can write as much as they can but we will try to get everyone's article in the appropriate edition without stacking articles from one specific member. We're still testing out how the process will be but I'm planning on 2 articles in the section per edition but we may expand it if we get plenty of submissions a week.\r\n\r\nIf 5 articles are submitted in Week 1, Week 1 edition will contain 2 of them, Week 2 will contain another 2, and finally Week 3 will contain the remaining 1. That's just an example, and how it's planned out for now.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. What other plans do you have for the future of the HF News?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] A small sneak peak to something I'm trying to plan for is a contest of some sort to advertise HF News and get more input from the community. HF News has been decreasing in viewership and it has to improve. Nothing is official but I'm trying to think of something for the community to get more involved with HF News. It most likely will revolve around some type of contest.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] That's good to hear! In recent news, a new section called the \"Improv Comedy and Stand-Up\" was created and closed within days. What did you think about it?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] It may have been a good idea at start and I personally thought it was a cool way of flowing some laughs through the community but I heard it was closed due to LQP and rule violations which I'm not surprised to hear.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] If the section could be brought back, what do you recommend should happen in order for it to stay?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] A moderator who can watch over it the best s/he can but even then, it just slightly reduces the LQP and rule violations. Maybe if it had rules like the marketplace. Break a rule = auto 3 day ban.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting idea. Along with some recent changes to the site, Omni is bringing back MoTM. What are your opinions on this?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] I enjoy the idea of a MoTM but people have to ruin it. I'd much rather have it as a committee vote and keep it as fair as possible. No matter what you do, people will bitch about it. I don't mind it gone or here, but it causes too much problems and it may just be best to get rid of it completely or revamp it to a different system.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Can you elaborate more on what you mean by a \"committee vote\"? Who will be apart of the committee?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] I was thinking of either a group of people chosen by Omni who would vote for who they think is truly the MoTM or the entire staff team vote on it.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Don't you think it would be unfair though? Isn't the community suppose to pick?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] There wouldn't be any cheating (besides bribing the committee so there is trust involved for sure). It's less drama and a better system overall in my eyes.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Do you believe that MoTM is more of a popularity vote rather than a vote for the most dedicated member?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] Oh yes, it's for sure a popularity vote. That's another thing the committee system would get rid of. It would make the award more meaningful. When I first joined HF, I had my eyes on that award and worked for it. In the past couple years, I don't even care if I get it because it has no value to it anymore.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Would you prefer to discontinue the first MoTM award and add a second one but using your system?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] Eh, would be a waste then, it could just continue with the new system and same award. HF isn't the type of forum to have numerous awards with different versions and seasons like other forums.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Regardless of what happens, I hope the future is bright for both MoTM and the HF News. Anything else you want to say before we wrap this up?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][color=white][b]iHydra:[/b][/color][/url] Not really, enjoyed answering the questions and giving my opinions on some stuff. Just would like to say one word and leave it at that. Carnival.\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

Kamkar's goal was to utilize the Texas Instruments CC-1110 Sub-GHz Radio Frequency transmitter chip built into the device. He first reverse-engineered the garage door signals with a Software-defined Radio, and realized that he could duplicate these signals with the handheld toy. After that, he loaded his custom firmware onto the device via easily accessible I/O pins and a GoodFET hardware hacking device. Once it was on, he coded a program that used the mathematical concept of the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence]De Bruijn Sequence[/url] to send every possible 12-bit combination to the garage door's transceiver and, hopefully, unlock/open the door. As Kamkar states, it is unfortunately the case that doors vulnerable to such a primitive attack are still sold, and even manufactured, to this day, despite having been demonstrated to be vulnerable over 30 years ago.\n\n[color=white][b]Utility Company Database 'Vulnerability'[/b][/color]\nIn some, or even many, cases of computer hacking, we find that the attack carried out did not utilize some advanced exploit or technical attack vector, but rather highlights and exploits an error in the logic of the programmer who had written the code. In a recent story of an unnamed utility company, a user attempted to pay his account balance via the online web interface. He had 'accidentally' changed his account number on the verification stage, and to his surprise, it displayed a completely different account's information, including their address, name, and phone number. With about 20 lines of PHP code, he had developed a proof of concept that was capable of exhausting the entirety of the utility company's user database. The researcher, a man writing for Atxsec, made it very clear that he, in no way, condones this attack, and that he performed it on his own equipment purely for research purposes. However, highlighting these vulnerabilities could prove to be invaluable to many other companies whose security has still not met up with the rest of us in the 21st century.\n\n[color=white][b]The[color=]Pirate[/color]Bay Co-Founder Released from Prison[/b][/color]\nIn the past few years, the controversial media/torrent sharing website The[color=]Pirate[/color]Bay has been continually chased by several departments from an array of countries and governments. The two brains behind much of the operation, the founder, Gottfrid Svartholm (Anakata), and the co-founder, Fredrik Neij (TiAMO), were arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced to jail time for their participation  in the site. Having provided billions of dollars worth in \"illegally\" shared media, it is safe to say that Neij, who needed only serve a 10-month sentence, got off with little more than a warning. Unfortunately, Anakata is still behind bars, and has been since his arrest in Cambodia in 2012. Gottfrid received a longer 3.5 year sentence.\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://ihydra.net/hfnt/headers/SecurityNews.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Researchers Open a Garage Door with a kids toy in 10 seconds[/color][/b]\nSecurity researcher Samy Kamkar has come up with a way to open almost any garage door that uses a fixed code and he's set it up on a $12 children's toy. The attack that Kamkar crafted, referred to as OpenSesame, has reduced the amount of time that it takes to guess a garage door's password from a few minutes to a could seconds. Typically, commercial garage keypads use 12 dip switches, which are binary, and provide 4,096 different combinations. This small of amount of possible combinations leaves these keypads open to brute-force attacks. “Now in a common garage and clicker, we’re going to be using an 8-12 bit code, and we see a single click sends the same code 5 times, and we see each ‘bit’ takes 2ms to send, with a 2ms wait period per bit after the entire code is sent. So a single 12-bit combination takes (12 bits * 2ms transmit * 2ms wait * 5 times = 240ms),” said Kamkar in a post discussing his new attack. With the most simple brute-force attack it would take 29 minutes, said Kamkar. Karmar began reducing the time to about six minutes by eliminating the retransmission of each code. Karmar discovered that most garage openers use a technique known as a bit shift register. This causes the opener to receive a 12-bit code, test the code, and if it's wrong, the opener will shift out one bit and pill in one but of the next code transmitted. “So the garage actually tests: 011111100000 (incorrect) (chops off the first bit, then pulls in the next bit) 111111000000 (correct!) Meaning we sent 13 bits to test two 12-bit codes instead of sending a full 24 bits. Incredible!\" Karmar used an algorithm known as the De Brujin sequence to automate the process and then Kamkar loaded it on to a discontinued toy called the Mattle IM-ME, thus creating this device.

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to use a victim's credentials to read messages or use their account for other online services. The partial disclosure was made after almost six months of bug report submissions from a Finnish researcher Jouko PYnnonen to Unity that are yet to be answered. Pynnonen said Unity today acknowledged the bugs reports and says it's working on a patch as well as improving their response to security concerns. Unity develops the Unity Web Plater alongside a game engine that's used to develop games on Windows, OS X, consoles, and mobile platforms. Despite its presence, Google recently decided to disable the NPAPI in Chrome, an API notorious for crashes and security concerns. This removal mitigates the vulnerability to a large extent. Fortunately, the Unity Web player is off by default. To exploit this vulnerability, one would have to lure the victim to an attacker's site hosting a malicious Unity app. Pynnonen explains that the vulnerability allows the malicious Unity App to bypass cross-domain policies that are supposed to prevent accessing the local filesystem or other outside sites. Pynnonen urges Unity users to be careful when using the Unity player.

A D.C. think tank tweeted that the hackers made off with security clearance going to 1982. The OPM handles government employment records as well as security clearance applications. If this data has in fact been breached, the identities and personal information of undercover operators and others linked to top secret work could be exposed. In the beginning, it was believed that the attack only gained access to the personnel databases which included SSNs and other personally identifiable information. While this data is an unfortunate leak, it's nothing in comparison to clearance application data. “The major difference between criminal and espionage campaigns is that criminals are all about monetizing commodity data where espionage actors are after esoteric information; diplomatic or political documents, intelligence, intellectual property,” John Hultquist or iSight partners, who connected the OPM hack to the Anthem breach, said. “Stuff that will give them a competitive advantage.\" The government is expecting to alert as many as four million people of this data breach. The Washington Post said that the attackers used a zero-day during the attack, but did not specify further.

It has been announced that the world premiere for the game will take place at the E3 showcase on June 14. While an official [i]Fallout 4[/i] website has now been released, it currently contains very little on the side of information of the game. The games director, Todd Howard, had this to say about the release: “We know what this game means to everyone,” said Todd Howard, “The time and technology have allowed us to be more ambitious than ever. We’ve never been more excited about a game, and we can’t wait to share it.” The game has been confirmed for the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC.[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2015-03-06-bethesda-officially-announce-fallout-4-reveal-dated-june-14th-at-e3-2015]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white][i]I am Bread[/i] Planned for a Playstation 4 Release[/color][/b]\nThe weird and wonderful toast simulator [i]I am Bread[/i] is now officially receiving a release on the Playstation 4. This comes from an announcement from designer Luke Williams in the Official Playstation Blog. A date for the game has not been announced, but it will contain new content that isn’t currently present on the Steam version of the game. \"You'll find we've added a whole host of game modes that see you taking control of a new type of bread, each with their own variation of the controls and completely new goals and challenges,\" Williams wrote. \"Become a baguette as you smash your way around the various levels, trying to cause as much destruction as possible; or become a bagel, and roll your way around a series of race courses in record time. To top it all off, you'll find a whole host of challenging Trophies to try and earn with all your bready companions.\" The game is also coming to iOS.[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8737241/i-am-bread-ps4]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]Amazon Games Heading Ambitious Project\n[/color][/b]For the past year Amazon Game Studios has been building its presence, but so far it has only released games on mobile and its own flagship Amazon Fire TV. However, through a job posting seen on Gamasutra, a new PC game from the studio is currently in the works. It’s apparent that Amazon Game Studios has large plans for this game, describing it as \"an ambitious new PC game project using the latest technology.\" The current developers on the game hail from games such as [i]Splinter Cell[/i] and [i]Far Cry[/i]. The team also includes developers who have worked on [i]World of Warcraft[/i], [i]BioShock[/i], [i]Half-Life 2[/i], [i]Left 4 Dead[/i], [i]Dota 2[/i], [i]Halo[/i], [i]Infamous[/i], [i]Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor[/i] and [i]The Last of Us[/i].[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8737057/amazon-pc-game-portal-world-of-warcraft-hiring]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://ihydra.net/hfnt/headers/TechNews.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=left]\n[b][color=white]Google Chrome to 'Intelligently' Block Auto-playing Flash Ads  [/color][/b]\nIf there's one thing more universally loathed than interstitial ads—you know, those full screen ads that cover the interface of their host application—it's auto-playing Flash ads, especially if they contain audio. If you don't already have an ad-blocker installed, then you might want to consider getting the upcoming version of Chrome. Google has announced today that it's been working with Adobe to introduce an update to Chrome that will \"intelligently pause content that aren't central to the webpage.\"\n\nWriting on the official Google Chrome Blog, Google's Tommi Li explains that this new feature is all about battery life: Flash animations still consume a large amount of CPU time, which in turn slurps down some of your laptop's vital lithium juice. By \"intelligently\" pausing any Flash elements that aren't central to the surfing experience—which is essentially a euphemism for \"ads\"—mobile users may experience a non-negligible boost in battery life.

Indeed, on our Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, we have noticed that some apps sometimes report high “mobile data active” time, even though they don’t always come up at the top in Android’s battery stats. Even the Xperia Z3, which is one of the most battery-efficient smartphones on the market today, is giving its users reduced usage times after getting updated to Android 5.0.2, and so are users of the OnePlus One, another device that had great battery life on Android 4.4.

At least, that's the implication of a new study done by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. The study, based on a survey of around 1,500 people, reportedly found that most people aren't comfortable with data mining by marketers.\n\nMore than half of the respondents (55%) disagreed or strongly disagreed that “it’s O.K. if a store where I shop uses information it has about me to create a picture of me that improves the services they provide for me”, while around 70% said it wasn't fair for stores with free WiFi to monitor shoppers' online activities, and 91% said companies shouldn't collect data about shoppers in exchange for discounts without telling them, according to a write-up of the survey in The New York Times.

The biggest news now is that both Russia and Qatar who had both won the rights to host the next two World Cups in 2018 and 2022 respectively may now lose this right if any bribery has been found within the voting process. This is a massive loss for both countries who have invested so much in the creation of new stadiums and work forces and the revenue produced by the World Cup is massive and gets bigger and bigger each year. Both countries have denied any wrongdoing but if found guilty they may face prosecution and large fines.\n[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33041467]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=white][b]Saudi Give Blogger 1,000 Lashes[/b][/color]\nA Blogger which was sentenced to 1,000 lashes has been convicted by Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court and the punishment has been upheld despite a worldwide outcry. Raif Badawi was arrested for \"insulting Islam through electronic channels\" and although his wife is currently in Canada they could not get the sentenced overhauled, even with the aid of many charities and right groups. Badawi ran the Liberal Saudi Network, which encouraged online debate on religious and political issues. Badawi received his first 50 lashes in January  but so far the other lashes have been postponed, presumably waiting for this decision by the court but a medical document was recently found saying he was not fit for this sort of punishment. \n[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33039815]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=white][b]Malaysia's Fatal Earthquake[/b][/color]\nOn Friday Malaysia received an earthquake on Mount Kinabalu which killed 16 people. Many of those named deceased were Singaporean school pupils on a visit to the mountain and currently 6 more remain missing. During Singapore's Southeast Asian Games venue all flags will be flown at half-mast and there will be a minute of silence to show respect for those deceased. The earthquake sent rocks crashing down the mountain which was the main reason for the deaths. \"Our hearts go out to their families, and to the TKPS community\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a statement also declaring 8 June a national day of remembrance. \n[i][size=x-small][url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33039206]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]",
