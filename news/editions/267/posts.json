Before we get started do you have any shoutouts you would like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] Hey, thanks for having me. I'd like to make a quick shout to our new probation mods, Roger Waters and King of Hearts.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] So you're quite an old Hack Forums member! How has Hack Forums changed for [b]you[/b]?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] Hack Forums in itself hasn't really changed. However we have seen small adjustments over the years. The owner has listened to what we want. Hack Forums went from a very private community to which needed invites to join, to an open community. We have seen some very important members leave over the years, which has been the biggest change. The recent currency made on Hack Forums, being the omnicoin.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting response. What are your current views on the Paris attacks?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] It's one the worst attack's we have seen. And on a personal note, I believe it is awful. As all acts of war are.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. I think we can both agree it was an awful attack. Do you have any hobbies outside of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] I am a fanatic about the human mind. I study the human mind whenever I am able to. I find myself watching and judging people. However, I am a fan of the NFL which for the UK is strange.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Haha. Quite odd. You're from the UK (like me). Do you feel that being in the UK puts you at a disadvantage at any point with Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] I don't feel that being in the UK puts me at any disadvantages, since all currencies are exchangeable, all websites are universal and most products are virtual. The only real downside is that the time zone difference can sometimes leave the community somewhat empty at times.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed; I would agree. If you could add any feature to Hack Forums, what would it be? Why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] If I was able to add any feature it would be a sensor feature. Allowing your profile to add censors, so that you don't have to see certain words. This wouldn't sensor it for anybody else, but it would sensor it for me, personally. Because sometimes the language on the forums can be a little overused and offensive.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome. What music are you interested in and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] Over the years my music selection changes. Firstly it used to be rock, heavy metal. Loved it, it would appeal to me at the time. Then It changed to general pop, because it's upbeat and gets me through the day.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Who is your favourite artist at the moment and what's your favorite track by them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] My favorite at the moment is Megan Trainer - All About that Bass. It's ridiculously catchy.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] If you could go back and change an event that has happened to you, what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] I would spend more time with my father before he committed suicide. I wouldn't stop him, but I would spend every second with him to make it more memorable.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Aww I'm sorry to hear it buddy. What is your favorite section in Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] My favorite section is the health section. With a PhD in medicine and Psychiatry, it is like my clinic.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, a PhD! Bet that is good money! So overall do you enjoy Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] I do enjoy Hack Forums, it's eventful, and the people are great. There is nothing I can think of which I would change, the owner has it perfect.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Well best wrap things up now. Thank you for coming on. Do you have anything you'd like to say before we wrap it up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827890][color=white][b]Psychiatry:[/b][/color][/url] All I will say is that I hope everybody continues to use the community, and to have a great day!\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

Samsung has unveiled a classic flip-phone style model to be released next year. Going by the moniker SM-W2016, the idea of the Samsung flip-phone is to keep the style of traditional open and close phones, with the computing power and internals of today’s devices. The SM-W2016 will have 64 Gigabytes of storage on board, and pack 3 Gigabytes of RAM. Unlike the flip phones of the time, this one will have not only a rear-facing camera (a whopping 16 megapixels) but also a 5 megapixel front facing sensor. Samsung has not announced whether the flip-phone will see a debut in the United States, but it is speculated to have a release in Asia.\r\n\r\n[b][url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/213087/]$13M Coolest Cooler Kickstarter Faces Major Problems[/url][/b]\r\nIf you are a Kickstarter user who has been keeping up with the site lately, you may have heard of the Coolest Cooler, and its whopping amount of backers. The Coolest Cooler, an innovative blender and cooler hybrid with built in speakers, has garnered some serious support among Kickstarter users, with backers donating a total of over $13 million to the project. Unfortunately for the producer of the cooler, Ryan Grepper, the project has run into major production issues and financial issues. The factory that is responsible for creating the cooler’s motor, has gone on strike and remains on strike. Without this key component, no more coolers can be made, meaning the many backers who supported the project will not receive their final product for some time. The manufacturing troubles don’t end there, with Grepper stating that not only is the manufacturing company going on strike, but that the company cannot find a suitable replacement manufacturer to make the motors. What backers of the Coolest Cooler may become even more upset about is Ryan Grepper’s decision to begin selling the cooler on Amazon for a short amount of time to “keep the lights on,” which may seem like a stab in the back for Coolest Cooler supporters, who will now have to wait even longer for their finished products to be manufactured, despite some of the coolers being sold for the holidays. \r\n\r\n[b][url=https://bgr.com/2015/11/16/iphone-6c-release-2016/]Apple Planning on Releasing iPhone 6c[/url][/b]\r\nAlthough the iPhone 5c’s release in late 2013 didn’t garner too much attention (which was made evident by its poor sales), it seems like Apple is going for a second try, starting with the news of a new affordable iPhone coming in 2016 - the iPhone 6c. Unlike Apple’s other current generation models that feature gargantuan screens, this new device will have a much more palm-friendly four inch display. Despite the smaller display, it won’t lack in processing power. The chipset used in the 6c is identical to the chipset used in the current generation iPhones – the Apple A9 chip. Although it has not been officially confirmed by Apple, it has been reported that the 6c will not feature some new software add-ons that the current iPhone 6s and 6 plus feature, like 3D Touch. \r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/GamingNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Premortal.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/19/9764504/fallout-4-patches-pc-ps4-xbox-one][b][color=white]Fallout 4 Patches Incoming[/color][/b][/url]\r\nThe Fallout game series has been notorious in the past for glitches and small problems being consistently present in their titles. Fallout 4, amidst critical and commercial acclaim, is no different. However, an update from the developers found on the official blog for the title assures players that updates and patches are on the way. The patches are to be released on Steam first, with releases on consoles to follow. The blog post does not specify which issues with the game are going to be addressed with these first patches, but some of the most common problems with the game have been noted by such outlets as [url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/10/9706436/fallout-4-buggy]Polygon[/url]. A beta version of the title’s first post-release patch is set to begin next week. \r\n\r\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-heroes-confirmed-for-pc-and-its-comin/1100-6432444/][b][color=white]Dragon Quest Heroes Coming to PC[/color][/b][/url]\r\nEarlier in November an advertisement was prematurely displayed on Steam for the game Dragon Quest Heroes. It has now been confirmed by an official Steam page that the title will become available on December 3. The game has been available on the Playstation 4 since October of this year. The official title on Steam is Dragon Quest Heroes: Slime Edition, which will contain the 13 DLC items already available on the Playstation 4 edition of the game. It has been stated by Square Enix that the game’s reception in the West will be a factor in deciding the localization of the Dragon Quest series in Europe and the Americas. Dragon Quest is a roleplaying game series that has experienced significantly more exposure in Japan than in western countries. \r\n\r\n[url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/20/9768834/sony-is-working-to-bring-ps2-games-to-ps4][b][color=white]Sony Working to Make Playstation 2 Games Playable on the Playstation 4[/color][/b][/url]\r\nThrough emulation, games originally released for play on the Playstation 2 gaming console may soon become playable on the Playstation 4.

The attackers arrived at the hotel with AK-47s and began to fire at people indiscriminately. Tamba Couye, who survived the attack said \"These people started shooting. They were shooting at everybody without asking a single question. They were shooting at anything that moved.\" The attack was allegedly a response to government aggression in northern Mali. The hotel was host to peace negotiations that morning, which could have been a motivating factor for the attack as well.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12008337/Armed-bandits-steal-masterpieces-worth-15-million-in-raid-on-Italian-art-museum.html][b][color=#FFFFFF]High Value Art Stolen From Italian Museum[/color][/b][/url] \r\nIn a very Hollywood-esque style heist, the Castelvecchio fortress in Italy was robbed of 15 million dollars worth of rare art last week. Three thieves, armed and wearing masks, tied up the lone security guard who was patrolling the area, along with one cashier. They entered after closing hours for the museum, allegedly never spoke a word to each other, and removed seventeen paintings from the walls. They made their escape with a car belonging to the security guard. Experts are speculating that the stolen art will end up in a private collection, as most of the pieces are far to high profile to be sold in any legitimate market. Also the fact that the thieves moved methodically, targeting specific paintings, indicates that they were directed by someone else to very specific pieces. The theft is being investigated, and is considered the most serious theft of Italian art in history.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/12008370/Israeli-spy-Jonathan-Pollard-released-from-American-prison-after-30-years.html][b][color=#FFFFFF]Israeli Spy Released from Prison After 30 Years[/color][/b][/url] \r\nAfter 30 years in an American prison, an Israeli spy named Jonathan Pollard was released. Pollard was convicted in 1987 of espionage, for passing classified information to Israel while working as a US Navy civilian intelligence analyst. Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu said he had \"longed for this day\" and wished Pollard \"a lot of joy, a lot of happiness and a lot of peace.\" Though he has asked to return to his wife in Israel, the United States has set conditions that he must stay in the country for a period of five years. During that time he will be required to wear an electronic bracelet monitor, and be subject to constant inspection and monitoring. Mr. Pollard has obtained a job in New York, and will begin work within a few weeks.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

As this might not come as a great shock to most, Omnicoin was a project kept together by the Hack Forums community.  \n\nOn November 18, 2015 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] announced that the Omnicoin project will be no longer.  Here are some changes that will occur in the near future with Omnicoin:\n[list]\n[*]The OMC award is currently removed for purchase\n[*]The OMC address plugin has been removed\n[*]Omnicha.in will expire on January 5\n[*]Paid nodes will be shut down\n[*]Pool.omnicoin.net will be shut down\n[*]Bittrex will remove OMC from their site\n[*]The posts in the Omnicoin subforum might get a prefix then moved into the main Cryptos forum.\n[/list]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] states that he has no regrets and greatly appreciates the community involvement in the Omnicoin project.  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1256441][b]Abraham Lincoln[/b][/url], a member of the Omnicoin development team tells me over an private interview that he will miss the Omnicoin project but is happy that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] is proud of their accomplishments.  One of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1256441][b]Abraham Lincoln[/b][/url]'s favorite memories while working on the Omnicoin project is the 51% attack where an anonymous user reached 51% of mining power and was able to manipulate the network with 'double spending' attacks. Though the Omnicoin project is ended, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1256441][b]Abraham Lincoln[/b][/url] tells me that he has no regrets; \"[i]Omnicoin was the reason I developed a passion for web development. Without Omnicoin, I wouldn't be who I am or where I am today[/i]\".  There has been talk that a few members may continue to perpetuate the Omnicoin project despite the recent changes.  As of now these are just speculations as we will have yet to see if new leaders emerge to keep the coin afloat.\n\nWe at the Hack Forums News Team would like to extend our gratitude to the team members of the Omnicoin project: [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1256441][b]Abraham Lincoln[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1088934][b]Crypto™[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1439038][b]Doctor Blue[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2015410][b]Meshcollider[/b][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][b]Magicmann[/b][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url]; We thank you for your years of service.\n\n[b]Weekly Highlights[/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5062743][b]Great Sadness[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b][color=#FF66FF]Omniscient[/color][/b][/url] \n[/list]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Memo.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/iHydra.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Happy Thanksgiving![/color][/b]\nGet off the computer for once, turn off your phone(s), and go spend time with your family and friends.
