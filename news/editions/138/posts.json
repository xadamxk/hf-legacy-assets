Prospective applicants were directed to the recruitment thread, now deleted, where they were to write about their past experiences with malware removal and analysis in under 300 words. The team had a restructuring and overhaul after Valiant left the forums, including a rebranding of the group. The current leaders, T3h Hacker, Paradoxum and AsSaSs@iN, have been preparing the MRT subforum and group for incoming trainees; those accepted will be the newest members to don the userbar in several months.\n\n[color=white][b]The Guardians Now Founded[/b][/color]\nIn other group related news, the official HF group known as The Guardians, formerly Beacon, opened its doors to recruitment for a short period of time this week. The group motto says it strives to help the community in many fields of the forum, and will stick out from the rest as an example for other members to follow. Led by Plaтiпuм and Morchid, new members have been added to the group and we can expect products from them soon. To see their official Q&A thread, click [url=http://goo.gl/zYV9g]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]PS Vita and PSP Forums Deleted[/b][/color]\nThe PS Vita and PSP Forums under the Gaming tab were deleted by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] last Sunday, citing inactivity within both forums. Their contents were merged into one Sony Gaming subforum, inclusive to all Sony consoles and not just those of the deleted forums.

Welcome to your HF News interview. To begin, do you have any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] Hey! Thanks for having me! Yes I'd like to make a few quick shout outs to the most amazing people in the community: OGkush for helping me out, FBI crime center for being a swell guy, Omni for being a boss and Virtualhacker for being there for better and for worse!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] When and why did you join HF? What made you stay online?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] Back in 2009-10 I checked the forums out as I wanted to be a hacker! But I've joined lay year in May just to learn the foundations to becoming a successful monetizer, it's not easy! I decided to stay as there were people who helped me out by giving me tips. Ever since I loved every moment, and cherish it with great respect. Stayed due to fun times shuts and giggles, and an amazing community which is like a family to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] What have you learned during your time spent here on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] I've learned many successful ways to make money. But the most important thing I've learned is that respect cannot be easily gained. Also I've learned that life is short and we should value every moment.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] What else do you do online? Do you play any online games?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] I enjoy playing games; it always puts me in a different dimension,  you should try out Runescape. Apart from that I work on few projects and blast out progressive and electro House music in my room.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any hobbies/jobs IRL?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url]  Happily haven't got a job at the minute which gives me extra time to enjoy my hobbies which are basketball and table tennis. I also love to workout. Having a nice body to show off in the summer is my current goal.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I love to workout too! 😝 Do you have any set goals on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] Since I've joined HackForums my goal was always to: \"Veni,Vidi,Vici!\" Currently I just try to help others pass the knowledge which made me who I am today.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any future projects that you are willing to tell us about?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] Haha, I wish I could tell you! I'm just working my socks off on RadarScan to make it awesome and easy to use. I may plan bigger projects, I guess you just have to wait and see, fingers crossed!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Are you interested in joining any official groups? Which ones attract you the most?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1315784][color=white][b]Miki:[/b][/color][/url] Ever since I became a member of the community Illuminati struck to be the number one group for me, I've applied for few groups but I guess they weren't looking for members like me, I've applied for Respawn, Empire and Beacon when it was alive. Currently I am so happy in Terror and wish to stay there for as long as possible.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for your time Miki!

Do you enjoy it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=482888][color=white][b]mad:[/b][/color][/url] I think HF is a great community, gives a chance to everyone who joins to learn new things. Personally I enjoy it, but it is always annoying to see some immature people around, though they represent a very low percentage.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for being willing to participate in this interview, mad!

The build off is a freebuild competition, meaning players are challenged to build the coolest creation they can with unlimited blocks at their disposal. The rules of the build off allow for clients, worldedit, and any and all materials which gives players a ton of creative freedom. The build off started a couple days ago on April 12th, however it doesn't end until Wednesday the 14th; there's still time to get a build in! The winner will receive $30 via PayPal and two runner-ups will receive $10 via PayPal. This is quite a generous prize from the members of Terror.

Good luck!\n\n[b][color=white]Mindcrack Ultra Hardcore[/color][/b]\nThe [url=http://www.mindcracknetwork.com/]Mindcrack[/url] community is playing Hardcore survival again in season nine of the annual Ultra Hardcore series! The Mindcrack ultra hardcore series is an ongoing gaming marathon where the players of the Mindcrack community battle to achieve a common goal; in this case the goal is to kill the ender dragon. They have to achieve this goal as fast as possible without logging out or taking breaks; if you think [i]that[/i] sounds hard, they're also playing on hardcore mode! This means that when you die you don't respawn! Additionally, health never regenerates and all other settings are on par with hard mode. The twenty five or so players of Mindcrack are divided into multiple different teams, each with four players. These teams must attempt to prosper while losing as little health possible as well as keep hidden and safe from mobs and other players; PVP is a very prominent aspect of the event. In order to kill the ender dragon, each team needs to complete tasks such as traveling to the nether to obtain blaze rods which can then be crafted into eyes of ender; they must do all this without dying.\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcHsE6ssiz8&list=UUFKDEp9si4RmHFWJW1vYsMA&index=17[/video][/align]\n\n[b][color=#87CEEB]PlanetBeacon[/color] [color=white]News:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1115097]Vortex[/url] is now a helper.

That is 114,080 years worth of gameplay. The announcement comes after Microsoft announced the game crossed over six million units, worth over $120 million. If you thought that was a lot, sales are expected to increase further when the Minecraft: Xbox 360 retail version hits shelves in America on June 4. The retail version was recently delayed so the \"very latest content\" could be included. It was previously set for April 30.\n\n[color=white][b]GTA Playlists on Spotify[/b][/color]\nRockstar Games have released Spotify playlists for most radio stations that have featured across the Grand Theft Auto series.

If you are a mobile fan, Rockstar Games also includes tracks from Liberty City Stories, Vice City Stories and Chinatown Wars. You may not see all the tracks due to regional restrictions, however Rockstar said \"We're hoping to be able to add the original songs within our control where possible soon.\" You can find the soundtracks on Spotify by searching \"Rockstar Games\" The upcoming GTA game, Grand Theft Auto 5, is set to be released on September 17th for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.\n\n[color=white][b]Hack Forums' Top Gamer 2013[/b][/color]\nYou'll be seeing this very soon.

There have now been 60 reported infections and two more deaths, which brings the death toll to 13. 19 people who had made direct contact with the two individuals now dead were put under observation, but they have not shown any symptoms for the infection. The state news has also reported that they have found three cases reported outside of the original infection areas. However, Michael O'Leary, a representative for the World Health Organization stated, \"There's no way to predict how it'll spread but it's not surprising if we have new cases in different places like we do in Beijing.\"\n\n[color=white][b]19 Killed in Somalia Capital[/b][/color]\nAs a result of a battle between Al-Qaeda linked terrorists and Al-Shabaab fighters, 19 individuals were killed in the capital of Somalia. Outside of the courts, a bomb had been let off and militants subsequently came into the city. A bomb also exploded next to an African Union and Turkish Red Crescent convoy. Hussein Ali, an employee for the courts, stated, \"Armed men entered the court and then we heard a blast. Then they started opening fire. We do not know the number of casualties.\" Also, \"About seven well-armed men in government uniform entered the court today as soon as a car bomb exploded at the gate. We thought they were government soldiers,\" remarked Aden Sabdow, an employee of the Mayor's Office.\n\n[color=white][b]33 or More Die in Peruvian Bus Crash[/b][/color]\nAround the city of Trujillo, a bus dived into a river on Saturday morning. It has been reported that 43 passengers were boarded onto the bus. Included in the death toll were were nurses and doctors. The red bus had fell into the rapids of the rocky Moche River. The bus had deported from Huamacho, and its destination was Trujillo which it never made. Local authorities placed the time of the incident at around 5:10 AM ET. Authorities also believe that there may be more of those who died, because there were others who were not on the bus but near the incident.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2zT4b[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nBill Campbell, a close friend of Steve Jobs, recently had a rather lengthy meeting with Intuit's CEO over something that \"make a product great, and some of the recent highs and lows he's seen in the technology industry and beyond.\" Even though Campbell could not specify what exactly was covered, hints toward the iWatch is almost fully evident. Campbell publicly stated that Google Glass was a \"phenomenal breakthrough\" and \"when you start to think about glasses or watches, they become as intimate as the cell phone was.\" Bloomberg has confirmed that there are nearly 100 Apple employees that are working on an iWatch, that is sure to release sometime this year.\n\n[color=white][b]Facebook[/b][/color]\nMobile users may already be aware, but Facebook has been planning to make further advancements toward mobile ads. The ads have caused a rather surprising annoyance to all mobile users. Deborah Liu, product manager, and Calvin Grunewalk, software engineer will be holding a live Question and Answer covering the new features and the most efficient strategies behind them. The meeting will be held April 17, at 10 am PT.\nIf you keep up with the plans and innovations of Facebook, you'll know that Facebook will be updating the layout of the News Feed very soon. Well Facebook has begun the change for several devices starting last Friday, including the HTC First, HTC One X, HTC One X+, Samsung Galaxy S III, and Samsung Galaxy Note II. Even if your device is not eligible for the early change you can still enjoy the new feature called Chat Heads, which will be a new feature for Facebook Home messaging.\n\n[color=white][b]Twitter[/b][/color]\nWith the rise of social networking utilities and changes, Twitter has also been changing its uses for users across the world. Friday, April 12, Twitter released its official music feature, called #music. #music focuses on music discovery, and suggests bands, artists, genres, varying on several things, along with who you follow. The application will not be a mobile music store, but an online radio option similar to Pandora. The app is said to show what music is trending, and the home of this tool can be found [url=https://music.twitter.com/]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Verizon[/b][/color]\nVerizon has been making several changes lately for their users, trying to keep everyone happy. The first change happened early last Friday, when Verizon allowed users who are not using a smartphone to have a pre-paid plan. For just 35$, users can have 500 anytime minutes along with options for unlimited data and messaging package. Verizon has made several other changes for their users, the next being the length of contracts. Customer's contracts used to last for 20 months, allowing users to upgrade to a new phone when the 20 months were over. Recently Verizon has changed this 20 month span, to 24 months, upsetting many customers. And the last of the major changes involves switching upgrade eligibilities. Verizon still allows users on the same plan to switch upgrades for that of the same category, ex smartphone -> smartphone. But the company has disallowed users to switch upgrades for tablets, or other non-phone devices.\n\n[color=white][b]WordPress[/b][/color]\nStarting Saturday, April 13th, Wordpress has been facing an exponential DDOS attack from over 100,000 botnets. Wordpress uses CloudFlare to add an extra layer of security between the site, and its users. In just one hour, CloudFlare has blocked over 60 million requests relating to WordPress. The botnet has been attempting to use a dictionary attack in order to crack passwords of the site. WordPress's CEO has sent out advisories to all WordPress users to encourage them to make their passwords long and not predictable. This attack's magnitude has alarmed many hosting sites, so HostGator and CloudFlare have been sharing information of the IPs in order to crack the case.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2zT4J[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Simon Cowell Never Dreamed of Being Rich[/color][/b]\nMillionaire Simon Cowell has reportedly claimed that he never craved things which he could never afford when he was younger. Now with a net worth of £300 million, he has said that younger people these days are far too materialistic, and only set goals for the future which involve money. He's seen the lifestyles and dreams of the youth change throughout his life, and he commented on his ideas for his own future. \"Well, first of all, be patient before you make any money and you have got to want to learn - I think that is absolutely key. The difference now compared to when I was growing up - designer things, travel, a phone - none of us had a clue. I never craved anything that I couldn't afford.\" The 53 year old is notorious for splashing large sums of money on beauty treatment, especially to minimize any wrinkles, through the use of placenta facials. He has said, however, that he takes part in a \"grueling\" exercise scheme which includes several hundred press ups per day.\n\n[b][color=white]Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne Currently Living Separately[/color][/b]\nThe TV star and Black Sabbath rocker, despite being married for over 30 years and having given birth to three children, have reportedly been \"living apart\" since moving out of their shared mansion. \"They are living at different addresses and are not spending any time together. They row a lot,\" an insider has commented to the British newspaper the Sun. \"They aren't acting like husband and wife. It is unusual to not even have dinner together when both of them are five minutes apart,\" he continued to say. Currently, Sharon is spending her time at the Beverly Hills hotel while Ozzy has rented a home in Los Angeles. Another source has also reported, \"Sharon and Ozzy have had plenty of opportunities to meet up but haven't spent any time together at all.\" The couple's daughter Kelly hinted that her parents' relationship was going through a rocky stage by making the following post on the social networking site Twitter: \"Why does every family in the world have that 1 member that will never get it and is completely ignorant to life in general?\" The two have also unfortunately been seen without their wedding rings.\n\n[b][color=white]Selena \"worried\" About Justin Bieber[/color][/b]\nThe pop star Justin Bieber is reportedly being \"begged\" by his family to drop his partying attitude and friends. Since splitting up from singer and actress Selena Gomez, he has been going through a tough period. He has been photographed smoking marijuana; accused of assaulting his neighbor and has been over two hours late to two of his performances, sparking anger across many fans' parents. His manager Scooter Braun and parents Pattie and Jeremy Bieber fear that he is spending far too much time with his many fans. \"His parents are at their wits' end. Even Selena is worried,\" an insider has reported to a British magazine. \"They're saying he should ditch the party entourage he's taking around Europe.\" Justin's mum Pattie has recently expressed concern over Justin Bieber's partying lifestyle and has publicly commented, \"Of course I pray for him and I encourage him. I can't really speak to how he handles that part of his life. [...] Him being 19, you know, I've just gotta let go a little and let him make some of his own decisions. He's growing up. He's 19. He's not my baby.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Music Video of the Week[/color][/b]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUJpRSLQ2kg[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2zT51[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nOppressive religious people just irk me. Their profound ability to deny reason and logic, instead pursuing blind faith without a single, questioning thought, tends to blow my mind. I am open to all religions and gladly accept religious practices, yet when the entire method of a religion is to brainwash the followers into taking away others' choices and to line the pockets of crooked controllers, I begin to wonder about the integrity of the core of humanity. So many follow as sheep to a slaughter, never thinking that the grass may actually be greener on the other side.",

More than 5 groups, regardless of who started it, \nsaid they were being sold/disbanded. It wasn't even funny. I found \nOmniscients prank to be hilarious, not asskissing, but the fact that \npeople believed there was an actual funny PM, when it was just a joke \nto trick people into thinking they were missing out on something, was \npretty clever IMHO. Dan's prank was pretty stupid, I love how he \nprobably didn't expect all the hate he got on that thread, I honestly \nwish that wasn't a prank, he thinks and acts like he's better than \neveryone because he owns a minecraft server that is well known. \nOverall, individually the most creative and funny prank was T3h Hack3r's \nsaying he was working for the AV companies.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][i]-Kray[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"April 1st-April 3rd were the most overwhelming days \nI've ever had on Hack Forums'. The \"New Posts\" feed were filled with \nthreads related to the controversy of Omniscient's \"PM\" prank. The \n\"Group and Crew General Discussions\" sub-forum was just stressful. \n143, The Empire, and Void were all supposedly on sale. In 143 sub-forum, \nit was posted that it was a joke which was terrible because I saw the \nprank thread before I checked the SF. Tibit indeed pulled the prank on \nsome of the Empire's members such as I, supposedly selling it to the \nall knowing bugga. The only two groups I was in as of that moment \nwere being \"sold\". That was just depressing.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1161771][i]-Beau™[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"Although I have heard many others claim the April Fool's joke of this \nyear was not very good, I beg to differ. I would have to agree that the \n\"official\" joke was not amusing, considering I never the PM. But what \nmade this year a good one wasmthe member and group made jokes. I \nwould have to say that IMO the best were both the joke done by you, \nthe Writ3rs, and Dan. Having his account temporarily closed was very \nbelievable and I think it tricked a good deal of members. The Writ3rs' \njoke was similarly pulled off nicely, but I think the reason for the claim \nof shutting down was a bit unrealistic; another forum claiming copyright \nto a news team is ridiculous and something I doubt could ever happen. \nBut either way I overall enjoyed this year's April Fool's jokes! :)\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1359690][i]-Panoptic[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Absolutely hated that prank. I totally forgot it was April \nfools day. I fell for everything that day and because I had no sleep the \nnight before I was really confused why everyone was making a joke. I \nam still waiting for Omni PM but that was a shit day. I fell for it and I \nwas shouting at some members on HF because of this. I disliked you all \nfor a good few days lol because of it. I don't care what age you are I \njust enjoy the quality to it, you don't need to be a professional to \nwrite news. \"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=733456][i]-Dalek Youb[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"What do you think of 'The Guardians,' the latest group?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://puu.sh/2zT5K[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://i7.minus.com/ibicNx8ZDEVt8t.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2zT7U[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/q8nvLsv.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://wumo.com/img/strip/-WM_strip_DK_20130415.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2zT93[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711]D3xus[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]BagHead[/url]\n[list][*]Minecraft News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=138559]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=398007]Apathy[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528]xadamxk[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679]SkyGuy[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193]Connected[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854]CarrotMilk[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editor[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426]+Awesome[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=138559]MarkMare[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=763021]Retribute[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
