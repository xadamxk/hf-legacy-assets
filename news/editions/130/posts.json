This is an automatic ban handed out by staff members with the ban reasoning \"All marketplace-style threads (buy, sell, trade, services) belong to the Marketplace. A three-day ban is automatic; wait it out. Read the Help Documents on your return.\" when someone makes a marketplace related thread outside of the HackForums Marketplace.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Valentines Day/Banner Changed[/b][/color]\r\nValentines day, the day for the exchange of tokens of affection.

For the 130th edition of the HF News, we've exterminated Flood as far as the eye can see to talk with Hexicidal. Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make before we progress?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: I would like to say thank you to the community of HackForums, without them, I wouldn't be here. :)\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You have a lot of friends and people you connect with on a daily basis. How did you choose people to be your partners for Logic & The Angels?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: To be honest, I didn't expect I would be recieving The Angels again. I thought this would be the end of it, but unexpected things always occur. When Sandshrew took out his loans, it was a catastrophe. The reason JB and Pheno are leaders of The Angels, and soon to be Void, are because of two things. They both are great friends of mine that I would trust with anything, and two, Sandshrew owes them a great deal of money. I feel it would be incredibly unjust to leave them both with nothing. I feel that they both will do amazing jobs at being leaders.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You must have a lot of stress over the group... what prompted you to make Void out of The Angels?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Stress is stress, you just have to make the best out of a bad situation. If you don't, it just gets worse. \r\nI feel like there is a necessary change needed. If I were to keep it as The Angels, it would carry that stigma of shame. Another issue I have is that, The Angels have no purpose. It was just an empty userbar with no family and no purpose to back it up.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You hope to build Void into something better than Logic was?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Yes sir. I have learned from the mistakes that I made when I owned Logic, and now I fully understand what needs to be altered for Void to be what Logic should have been. I also hope to reunite the members that were previously involved in Logic. It would be unfair if I were to leave them in the dark, they were what made Logic special to me.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Void is going to be a deeper SRPP than Logic was, if I'm not wrong? Or what is its exact purpose?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: You are right, and there is more. I want Void at its essence to be a scientific discussionary group, but I want there to be depth to that. One major plan I have for Void is to see if we can reform the SRPP to a higher standard. I hope to be involved within the SRPP for bi-weekly debates with the community to accept new members alongside an open recruitment. I feel that with invite only groups that many members miss their opportunity to prove themselves because they are simply overlooked.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: You want more of a forum-based involvement with the group. Interesting, that and not being invite only.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: I understand why groups wish to solely be invite only, but for Void I don't feel like that would benefit the group. When Void is fully opened, I hope to begin with that strong Logic base and grow from there on out.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Great that you'll be starting from somewhere great. What originally prompted you to buy the Coders so long ago?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Like many, I always aspired to own a usergroup. Then the scandal occured with HEV, I saw my opportunity and struck. A word of advice for all members of the community, don't let opportunitys slide. If it's there, seize the moment and utilize what you can.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: I wish I had the resources to do so. Currently running on an empty wallet... how did you make all your money for the purchase?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: I am a full time student, so I asked Phenomenal to put the down payment on Coders, and I would pay for the rest and future transactions with the group. I don't see the group as an investment, I see it as a family. When I sold it to Sandshrew, I think I lost sight of what was true.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: What do you define to be \"true\"?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: The community and the people I surround myself with. You are whom you associate with, and if you lose those connections, you lose yourself.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Very deep. How did you become friends with Phenomenal?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: Phenomenal messaged with a proposal and it just happened. Some things in the universe lead you to a situation. There is an old Chinese proverb that applies to life, friends, relationships, and situations you are in. \"An invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet, regardless of time, place, or circumstances. The thread may stretch or tangle but will never break.\"\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Interesting how you two met. Who are your other friends on HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: That's honestly a great question. I don't have many friends on HF. I would say Soulmate, and iElement. I don't make friends well, but I try and treat everyone equally. Many members on HF know me, but I would call them acquaintances.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=lime][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Good to hear you have close friends. That's all the time tonight... Any closing comments?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][color=white][b]Hexicidal[/b][/color][/url]: I would like to say thank you for interviewing me and thank you to the community for everything.\r\n[i]See you starside.[/i]\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688]Hefto[/url][/font][/size]\r\n[Spoiler=]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Before Judge Dread notices our shenanigans, would you like to give a shout out to anyone Hefto?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: Id like to give a shoutout to Grxy, Hug., #Nate, Anima Libera, Pendalum, Kray, Diabolic, Kyle, Positive, and Anarchy.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: That's a pretty decent list! Like always, what has brought you to Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: I came here for the Griefing section and the minecraft section, I didnt really look at the other sections that much but occasionally looked at Computer Overclocking, Customizing and Hardware and the lounge.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: You have been a member for almost a year I noticed. Do you think the forums have changed since you first joined?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: Yes It has changed a lot, there has been the Money tab, the database leak, lots of group changes, staff promotions and demotions, and hopefully there is more good changes to come.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, change is sure to happen. With that being said, if you could change one thing about Hack Forums, what would it be?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: I disable post count for lounge so it wouldnt be filled with people making pointless post just for their post count to go up. It would make the lounge better in my opinion.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Do you think that the staff and mentors do a good job controlling the forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, I think that they do. If it wasn't for mentors there would be a lot of threads out of order such as people posting threads in the lounge to get more views. Staff do a good job doing reports and banning people that need to do be banned.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I have known you for months from the Empire, what was the first Private Group you have been in?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: I joined TechSperts in June or March of 2012 and it was a really good group, I dont remember much about it but I do know that it was fun.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Sadly, I joined just after that group had changed. What would you say has been your favorite group, and why?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: My favorite group so far would have to be Rhythm. In Rhythm everybody knew everybody and everyone would have a good time as long as it followed Hack Forums rules.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: I remember the day Rhythm closed, many users lost thousands on their post count. What would you say you have learned the most from Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: I have learned a lot of stuff to do with computers and virus removal. I have picked out friends PCs before and helped them keep it secure after buying it. I am now learning Java and HTML and have many more things to learn.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Well this interview is coming to an end. Do you have any final comments?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237688][color=white][b]Hefto[/b][/color][/url]: I don't have too much else to say, but I would like to thank you for interviewing me and to have a nice day!\r\n[/Spoiler]",

This version of Minecraft was created specifically for the [url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/]Raspberry Pi[/url], a credit card sized mini computer that hooks up to a keyboard and monitor. Based on the pocket edition, Minecraft Pi Edition contains support for multiple programming languages and has a slightly smaller set of features than Minecraft PE. It was created with the intention of helping programmers, and owners of the Raspberry Pi are encouraged to modify the game and its code; in fact, the Raspberry Pi itself is a tool made for programmers. Minecraft Pi Edition is the fourth version of Minecraft to date, following the PC, Xbox and Pocket editions of the game. The Pi edition can be played just like any other version of Minecraft, however it was intended to be changed via code; once you get the hang of things, you can crack open the code and use programming languages to manipulate things in your world. The possibilities are endless with this modified port of the pocket edition. For programmers who own a Raspberry Pi, this free modifiable version of Minecraft could be a blast to play with.\n\n[b][color=white]Weekly Snapshot: 13w07a[/color][/b]\nThis week's snapshot features a few bug fixes as usual.

Destiny was described as the world's first \"shared-world shooter.\" \"Very few games transcend their medium and their genre to truly become a part of popular culture; to belong in the time capsule as something that we can all share. And we believe Destiny could become one of those games,\" Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg said, describing its title as the \"worst-kept secret in the history of secrets.\" \"If you enjoy shooters, Destiny is going to be the best game you've ever played,\" Jones said. \"Destiny is Bungie's next great shooter and is set in an amazing new world that we're building. In Destiny, players get to build their own characters and grow them over time. We're really putting players in the center of the world and giving them control over their experience. From the ground up we've built this game to be social and cooperative.\" Destiny may launch later this year according to past legal documents, however Bungie and Activision have not said anything about dates. Destiny is Bungie's first post-halo project game.

Specifically, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni collective, announced that they were responsible for the mass-murder. Deputy Inspector General of Police Khan Nasir remarked, \"The explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device fitted to a motorcycle.\" Some witnesses saw first hand both women and children being burned alive from the explosion. Though this group isn't the most prolific terrorist organization in the media, Pakistan claims that Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is becoming a stronger force in the area.\n\n[color=white][b]Over 1,000 Injured in Meteor Blast Over Russia[/b][/color]\nOn Friday morning in the Ural region of Russia, a meteor flew across and blasted in the skies. The blast left buildings destroyed and over 1,000 injured. The blast is said to be the equivalent of 300,000 tons of trinitrotoluene (TNT). While most of the injuries are claimed to be minor, there were in fact about 200 children harmed from the blast. Along with the injuries, roughly 3,000 buildings sustained damages. Over 15,000 emergency response workers were sent out to aid people and clean up. Teams were also sent out to find and recover the pieces of the meteor. You can view footage of it here: http://goo.gl/ItWDq\n\n[b][color=white]Libya Arrests Christian Missionaries[/color][/b]\nIn Benghazi, four foreigners were arrested for attempting to spread Christianity. The printing of Christian books were also one of the reasons for the arrests. Hussein Bin Hmeid, a security official, stated, \"They were arrested on Tuesday at a publishing house where they were printing thousands of books that called for conversion to Christianity...proselytizing is forbidden in Libya. We are a 100 percent Muslim country and this kind of action affects our national security.\" A security organization Preventative Security is currently holding them for interrogation, and then they plan to hand them over to the Libyan government.\n\n[b][color=white]Horse Meat Scandal's Scope Widens[/color][/b]\nRecently, Irish officials found a significant amount of horse meat in a few hamburgers during a routine check. Not only occurring in Ireland, the horse-meat hamburgers were also present in France, Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway. The horse meat also had a substance that is banned in the U.K.-- due to its potential lethality in high doses. However, U.K. Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies pointed out that the substance posed a low risk of such a thing. Romanians have been accused of being responsible for the horse meat, but they argue that their horse-meat was properly labeled before it was exported. Investigators in France found that a French company raked in over 700,000 dollars in profits from the horse-meat burgers. The first three arrests were made in the United Kingdom this Thursday.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/251Eh[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nOn February 15, a post made was by a software development engineer in test on the Microsoft Careers site which said that Microsoft is going to release an update for its Windows 8 which was termed as 'Windows Blue'. According to this, it's expected that Microsoft is going to improve the start screen, application lifecycle, windowing and personalization. \"We're looking for an excellent, experienced SDET to join the Core Experience team in Windows Sustained Engineering (WinSE). The Core Experience features are the centerpiece of the new Windows UI, representing most of what customers touch and see in the OS, including: the start screen; application lifecycle; windowing; and personalization. Windows Blue promises to build and improve upon these aspects of the OS, enhancing ease of use and the overall user experience on devices and PCs worldwide.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Google[/b][/color]\nGoogle removed a doodle without publishing it. Google developed a doodle for the occasion of Asteroid 2012 DA14 passing Earth. It was said that this asteroid would pass the Earth without creating any havoc. So, Google's doodle was created which was nothing but that the second 'g' in 'Google' skids away and the asteroid passes through the gap. But unfortunately, the real asteroid did create an havoc at the Russian side. As a result, Google removed this doodle without being published. \"Out of respect for those injured in the extraordinary meteor shower in Russia earlier today, we have removed today's doodle from the Google home page.\", said Google. The doodle can be viewed [url=http://www.google.com/logos/2013/asteroid_2012_da14s_near_miss-1409005.2-hp.gif]here.[/url]\n\n[color=white][b]Sony[/b][/color]\nSony's next gaming console PS4 is expected to be unveiled on Wednesday, this week. Reports says that streams will involve games designed for its current console, PlayStation 3. This could be an attempt to provide backup compatibility.

WSJ said that PS4 games would be able to accommodate new games on optical disks. The launch is expected to be held at an event in Manhattan on February 20. CNET's Rich Brown had few words regarding the launch of PS4: \"Imagine playing a core PlayStation...[game] on your console, then picking the game up exactly where you left off on your cell phone or tablet.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/251Eu[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]The Grammys[/b][/color]\nThis year's Grammy awards, which took place last Monday, was quite an event.

Taylor Swift opened the event and blew the crowd away with her flashy performance of \"We are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". The unexpected pairing of Bruno Mars and Sting surprised the audience with their Bob Marley tribute, and Ed Sheeran and Elton John harmonized during their duet performance of \"The A Team\". To close the night, rappers LL Cool J and Chuck D assembled an 'A-Team' of their own and took the stage with DJ and producer Z-Trip, guitarist Tom Morello and renowned Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker.\n\n[color=white][b]Country Singer Mindy McCready Dead At The Age of 37[/b][/color]\nMindy McCready, 37 year old country singer and widowed mother of two, was found dead on Sunday night. Evidence suggests that McCready committed suicide, accomplished by a gunshot to the head. She had previously been sent to rehabilitation centers for alcohol abuse and self harm, and her children were taken out of her custody.

The plane burst into flames after a failed takeoff and Barker was severely injured. On Facebook, he stated \"I still haven't gotten over the horrific events that took place the last time I flew when my plane crashed and four people were killed, two being my best friends\". During the tour, Travis will be replaced by Brooks Wackerman of Tenacious D.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en&client=mv-google&gl=CA&v=Vhf5cuXiLTA&nomobile=1[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/251Nx[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nWowza.\nIt has definitely been a full week.\nWe've made a few changes. \nFor one, D3xus has been replaced with CarrotMilk. We felt this was best, as D3xus no longer had the time to put in.\nSecondy, Mr. Anderson has taken a break to deal with his college courses, so he has been replaced with Cody.\nThirdly, sad as I am to say it, a strike system has been set up within the HF News team.

What's your reasoning?\"\n\n[i]\"So I'm not worried since my upgrades were gifted. However I am worried for \neveryone else how would it feel knowing if someone hated you enough they could \neasily prank call you, try to break into your home. That can't be right, another reason \nI'm not really scared is I live so far away from most of HF I know there to be other \nNew Zealanders on here but none close enough to me to get scared. But other people \non here are not so lucky, they might have someone right across the road from them \nand they might just start to invade each of there personal lives. Though I saw Omni \nsaid he would be encrypting the UID table, I think even if he never saw this leak coming \nhe should have encrypted it none the less on the off chance it happened, but that \nit has it is to late.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1237824][i]-Perfect Cell[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"Personally, I'm not worried one bit about the security leak. I upgraded \nlong before April 2011. And I'm not worried about future intrusions either due to the \ndata being stored elsewhere and encrypted. In my honest opinion, nobody should worry \nabout it too much, because if someone really doesn't like you, they are going to do something \nabout it, regardless if this dump happened or not.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=47962][i]-_DeNy[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I am not worried about the security leak, some of the few people that actually have \nit has told me that im safe.

You might get a few phone calls, items in the mail or maybe \neven a raid if they really wanna mess with you.
