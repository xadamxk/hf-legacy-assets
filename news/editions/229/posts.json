On February 25th, 2015 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread announcing that there was going to be a junk purge and post recount later that day.

For now, all that's been stated about the group is that Debug is a group that will help HackForums members learn how to code. Many members were very pleased with the group's arrival as a coding group has been suggested many times. The group will have teachers and students, and the group's current status is that they're looking for one helper through a recruitment thread located [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4706431]here[/url].

What's up man?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Hey! Nothing much really, just playing a bit of Old School Runescape and watching some White Collar. How are things on your end?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I'm enjoying myself after a long day. Are there any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds like a good night! Yeah, shoutout to all the boys (and Bugga, trvp, and Cali) in Nightfall! If it weren't for being in that group, I would barely come on HF, as I rarely find myself out of the group subforum nowadays.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Really? What is it about the group that's so interesting?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Being part of Nightfall doesn't feel like a commitment, which is something that the other groups don't really do very well. All these other groups demand that their members complete certain tasks and follow all sorts of stupid demands to stay in. I come on HF to talk to people and have a laugh, if I wanted to work for someone for no money, I'd go and polish my Dad's sandals. \n\nIn Nightfall, there are a fair few members, but the group of us that are very active can easily fill up a lounge (2k posts) within a few days. Getting home from school and coming on HF to read through the posts that I've missed during the day has become part of my daily routine! \n\nBut yeah, like I said before, being in Nightfall is 1,000,000x more interesting and fun than any of the other groups on HF. We get a lot of bad things said about us, purely because of our nature. All of the uptight pricks think that everything has to be about work all of the time, whereas Nightfall is a place to relax without feeling the need to finish some sort of assignment to avoid being kicked out by some rich 16 year old kid on a forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed, I definitely love being a member. Since we're on the topic of groups, how do you feel about Debug, the new programming group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] First of all, I think that they look very good. Their userbar and general graphics are really simple and eye-catching. I love the colours that they used. I also like the idea of the group. There are too many \"get rich quick\" groups, in which the only people who are getting rich are the leaders with their ridiculous buy-ins. The fact that they plan to \"help Hack Forums members learn how to code\" is quite cool too. Too many groups take the buy-in fee from their members, and they don't give them anything in return. Now, obviously you could just look online for a programming course, but some people may prefer to talk to an actual person, and this group is a really good place for that to happen. Let's hope that it lives up to its goal!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Definitely, I know the group is in good hands and it's something we've needed for a while now. Do you see yourself applying?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I certainly agree! Hmm, programming is something that I've always wanted to get into, but I'm sure that there are hundereds of other members who would take it far more seriously than I would. I've got other things going on at the moment, and I feel that I'd be too inactive.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Never count yourself out buddy. So how were you introduced to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Haha I'll consider it! Hmm, from what I can remember, a friend of mine mentioned something about it on Skype, and he was telling me how he was getting Netflix accounts for free, which intrigued me. I mean, who doesn't like free stuff? So I signed up, and one post lead to another, and then I ended up here! His name is Apex on HF last time I checked, we don't really talk too much which is a shame.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] What made you stay active on the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I was looking for ways to make money! I tried my hand at E-Whoring, which worked out really well, but I can't see myself going back to it. I made over £1,000 over the summer, but I ended up spending most of that on pizza or online goods, as it would have spooked my family if I withdrew that amount of money. I kind of regret wasting it all, but hey-ho, I had a great summer. Nowadays, Nightfall is the only thing keeping me active. Some may call me a \"lounge whore\", but I find that I don't really have much of a purpose outside of the Nightfall lounge, or even the normal lounge.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That would make for a lot of pizza haha. And there's nothing wrong with living in the lounge, you're not alone. What do you do outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] It sure did! Yeah,you're right. Some people don't come to HF to act like somebody they're not, we just come here to talk about stuff.\n\nWhen it comes to my personal life, I fit the 'average HF user' profile very well. Most of my spare time is spent on gaming/movies/tv, and I don't have the biggest social life. I'm not un-popular by all means, but I don't really try and fit myself into any of the outgoing cliques at school, I'd rather spend my money on a game that'll keep me entertained for 30+ hours over a pair of shoes that will impress a girl who's way out of my league. I used to write e-books for somebody on HF, but sadly he was closed. I really enjoyed English lessons at school, but I didn't decide to choose it as one of my A Level subjects, which I really regret.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yep, most members tend to be like that. Do you have any hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I play snooker at least 3 times a week! Most people laugh when I say that, but I really enjoy it. I grew up playing it all the time, and I guess it stuck with me! I don't really plan on going pro, but it's something that I really like doing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, I was terrible every time I played. What other kinds of games do you play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I was too, at first! There's more to it than just hitting one ball into another! IRL, I only really play snooker, pool, football, and basketball. I did play cricket once at school, and I got 150 runs, but every time that I've played since I haven't been able to get more than 10. Nowadays, I mainly play Old School Runescape, as previously mentioned. One night, Vinnie came up with the idea of starting a new Runescape account. A few of us decided to go along with it, and within a few days, we were sweating it all day. Other than Runescape, I play CS:GO, Besiege, and GTA V. I still play it on an Xbox 360 though, I don't see the point in having a next-gen console. I'm only keeping it until GTA V is released on PC, if it ever is.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Are you a hardcore gamer or just a casual?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] I don't really think the term \"hardcore gamer\" makes me look good, but I'm certainly not a filthy casual. I'm somewhere in between!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Well there's that. Is there anything you'd like to say before we conclude this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=white][b]Spyro The Dragon:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for taking the time to interview me! I hope you guys enjoyed reading this.

Welcome to the 229th Edition of the HF News. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Shoutout to my homies Renium, Danny, Viper, and all my friends in The Brotherhood and Echo.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] I see you're interested in photography. What inspired you to start?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, Photography has been around me for a while now. I started when I was around 13-14 years old with just a little camcorder that my parents bought me. From there on I started recording and photographing skateboarding, BMX, Basketball, Baseball, pretty much anything that was around my house. Over time I got a little bit more \"into it\" I guess you could say. For my 16th birthday, I got a Sony A35, which is a semi-decent DSLR. I started taking pictures of everything and looking up guides on how to do long-exposure light painting. Right now, I am taking a few photography classes online hoping to expand my knowledge in photography. The thing about photography, you can express so many emotions and ideas through just a single picture. That's why I find it so interesting. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! Do you do photography professionally, or is it just a side-hobby for you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Right now, it is just a side-hobby. Although, I have sold a few prints and canvases over the past few months, I don't think of it as a job. If I could pursue photography professionally, I would but, as a full time student in high-school I am trying to get as much knowledge and practice in now so, after high-school I can intern and possibly start shooting at sporting events, or weddings, or something along those lines.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's interesting. So, what got you started here on HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Oh boy, that's the question. What got me started on HackForums... Well, when I was younger I remember seeing HF pop up as I was looking for those 1337 Runescape Gold Hacks but, I never signed up for the site. Then just recently last November, I think I was looking for some graphics or coding tutorials. I saw HackForums pop up and said Why not? I browsed around for a little bit and actually found it quite interesting. I started posting some more and exploring the different sections. I found the Photography 101 section and I think that's what really hooked me. I just love seeing everyone in one community working together.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] During your stay here on HackForums, who do you personally feel has contributed the most to the Photography 101 section?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Hmm, that's a tough one. I'm stuck between Vanilla or Denitorious, as both of them are very active in the Photography 101 section and they are both very skilled photographers who I admire. I'm going to have to go with Vanilla, although its a close call.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Let's shift our attention now to groups. I see you're a part of The Brotherhood, Fortune, and Echo, could you give some opinions on how you feel they've impacted HackForums so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Well, All 3 groups I am apart of, I feel have contributed to HackForums in their own way. The Brotherhood was the first group I was accepted into. I just remember being so hyped when I got the accepted into their GFX sector. The Brotherhood I think has done a good job implementing sectors within the group. It allows the group to bring in a wider variety of members with different skill sets. Also it gives the group more opportunities to give back to HackForums, through tutorials and guides. The information that comes out of The Brotherhood's sectors is always super detailed and informative. Echo... I was recently accepted into Echo because I threw down a sick freestyle for my application. I love groups that are a lot more laid back yet still accomplish things. Echo is appealing to me now that its a lounge based group, it gives you the chance to have more conversations and really get to know all the members in the group. Also that we're Anarchists according to Hydrazs. I will not confirm or deny that statement. Finally, Fortune... Fortune is a very knowledgeable group of members who know their stuff. I didn't know what expect when I first was accepted into Fortune. I believe Fortune is really giving aspiring online marketers with a wide range of skills a chance to make some really great products. And since HF has such a huge community, there is such a massive group of people to reach out to. Fortune has graphics artists, programmers, writers, and marketers in it, and all together we make an outstanding group in my eyes.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Cool. Speaking about groups, what is your opinion on buy-ins? Are they good or bad in your eyes?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Buy-ins are pretty stupid. No offense to the groups that have them but, I think if a group really wants knowledgeable and skillful members, than they should be recruited based on skill and their portfolios.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] What about the course HackForums is currently headed into? What's your opinion on HackForums as it is right now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Although, I cant judge much from the past since I haven't been here super long, I feel that HackForums is pretty content right now. There is always room for improvement in any setting. Maybe some more community based events or something in that direction but, we will just have to see what Omni is hiding up his sleeves.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Apart from HackForums and Photography, are there any other things you're interested in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Things I enjoy outside of HF and Photography include: Long walks on the beach with my boyfriend, Skateboarding, Longboarding, Skydiving and Graffiti Art.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Ah, how long have you been skateboarding? Anyone you look up to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] I've been skateboarding since I was around 3-4 years old, I'm 18 now. My all time idol as I was growing up was Tony Hawk. He is pretty much the one who inspired me to keep skating throughout the years. Broken bone after broken bone....\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] You also mentioned Graffiti Art. Do you participate in it yourself, or do you admire other peoples' work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] I used to participate in it... heres my story on why I stopped... I had been in the \"graffiti\" scene for a couple years, not really doing anything except posting up stickers and small tags around town with sharpies and markers. I got my best friend into it and we both started practicing all the time, in our notebooks, on desks at school, literally everything. We decided we would go to the local paint shop and buy some spray paint. (Me being 16 and him being 17) they sold it to us because it was for a \"School Project\". We would go out every couple weekends and tag random stuff downtown. We live in a pretty small town which caused a small problem because our stuff ended up being everywhere. We started getting more and more cocky, hitting bigger and more highly populated spots. I made a paint sprayer out of a pesticide sprayer and a gallon of black paint and walked down these train tracks by my house and sprayed all the trains with our tags. Then, one weekend, two weekends before my birthday we decided to go out and do the usual. We had about 40 cans of paint in my car along with 100 or so markers. We walk our normal route downtown and while I was driving home we saw this abandoned box truck parked in a vacant lot just asking for it. I decided why not real quick. We pull over into the lot park. I get out and start spraying this out of this box truck. Mid spraying, I see a car sitting at the intersection light coming into the lot. I panic and tell my friend to get the hell in the car. We speed off and hit this back road that was connected to the backside of the lot. No cars around, Were safe. NOPE. Next thing I know there's a cop with his lights on pulling us over. Immediately I go into panic mode. It feels like I went into a state of 3rd person. I remember telling my friend. \"this is it were screwed\". Roll down my window, pull out my id with paint ALL over my arms and hands. Cop tells us to get out, we cooperate and he lets us go. We ended up getting teen court which is no biggie compared to Juvie.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Yikes!

Basically, just parties that went wrong.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=yellow][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Wow that must have been crazy. Anyways, we're out of time here, is there anything else you would like to mention last-minute?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2456115][color=white][b]illustrator:[/b][/color][/url] Alright, Thank you for taking your time interviewing me.

However, vigilant efforts on the part of law enforcement led to the take-down of GameOver ZeuS as well as another well-known software, Cryptolocker, which were often used in conjunction with one another. The ZeuS botnet had, over the course of its lifetime, infected some 1.1 million internet devices, predominately targeting Windows PCs, and was involved in thousands of cases of banking fraud culminating in over $100 million in damages and stolen funds. Due to the severity of the malware, the federal government had dedicated great amounts of time and resources to detect and stop the connection to the command and control servers, eventually leading to a successful defense. One of the alleged ringmasters of ZeuS, Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, has been placed with a bounty of $3 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. The Attorney General of the Department of Defense has noted her interest in finding Bogachev quickly.\n\n[color=white][b]Lizard Squad Hacks Lenovo?[/b][/color]\nDue to recent events regarding Lenovo's security policies on their pre-packaged Windows operating systems, hackers and consumers alike are outraged at the fact that advertising is desired more so than the security of the users. Although it has not been confirmed, the leading idea is that Lizard Squad is indeed responsible for these attacks and was responding directly due to the Superfish scandal wherein software sanctioned by Lenovo was harvesting users' data and hijacking encrypted communications. A recent attack on http://google.com.vn by Lizard Squad strongly indicates that they are also related to the Lenovo hack, as the two domains not only use the same domain registrar ([url=http://Webnic.cc]Webnic.cc[/url]), but are both hosted by [url=https://www.digitalocean.com/]DigitalOcean[/url] in the Netherlands DataCenter. Though the website suffered several attacks, the first one forwarded all traffic to a website that played the song [i]Breaking Free[/i] from High School Musical, undoubtedly an analogy to 'breaking free' of Lenovo's prying eyes.\n\n[color=white][b]BlackShades Creator Please Guilty[/b][/color]\nThe BlackShades Remote Administration Trojan (RAT) has been among the most widely sought after software on HackForums and for good reason; it was well-designed and stable enough to support hundreds, if not thousands, of connections. The software was hugely successful, but also led to the malicious activity perpetrated by thousands of users of the software. For only $50, any novice hacker could have had access to hundreds or thousands of victims. The 24-year old Swedish co-developer of the software had faced charges that would have gotten him 17 years in prison including counts of computer hacking, conspiracy to commit fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Alex Yucel, the defendant in question, has made a deal with the authorities to plead guilty in exchange for a lower sentence, as well as revoking his right to appeal should the sentence be fewer than 8 years. Although about 100 people so far have been convicted of distributing BlackShades, the developers and masterminds behind the operation will likely receive much harsher penalties.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/zSb3PUT.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=46411]zer0-[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=91531]ven0m[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Ramnit Botnet Takedown Frees 3.2 Million PCs[/color][/b]\nEuropol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), in coordination with other law enforcement agencies, led a takedown of the Ramnit botnet that was estimated to have infected 3.2 million Windows computers. This botnet was used by criminal syndicates to steal banking information as well as social media passwords. Botnets rely on networks of servers to allow the criminals to send commands to any bots they currently control. Europol said law enforcement took over seven of these servers along with hundreds of internet domains used by the botnets owners. As of right now, no one has been arrested but the botnet itself has been severely disrupted and partially dismantled with the server takeovers. You can check to see if you are infected with Ramnit using [url=http://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tolls/virus-removal-tool.aspx?cmp=70130000001xGqlAAE]Sophos Free Virus Removal Tool[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Pwnium - Now All-Year, No Funds Limit Bug-Hunting Contest[/color][/b]\nPwnium, the browser-exploiting competition, is expanding from a one day event to a year round event. Aside from now being a year-round event, the payout for bugs being found will have no limit according to Tim Willis of the Chrome security team. Usually when a security researcher finds a bug, they will hold onto it until the one day event then will be rewarded. Instead, they would rather have security researchers turning in bugs as soon as they find them instead of hoarding them for the competition once a year. This will allow security researchers to find bugs while not duplicating their efforts by hoarding the same bugs until the next competition.  Google is adding Pwnium-style bug chains on Chrome OS to the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards (VRP) Program.The top reward will be raised to $50,000 all year round.\n\n[b][color=white]Parking Fine Company Accidentally Publishes 10K Motorists' Information[/color][/b]\nSky News, a mainly UK news site, has revealed that a UK parking fine company has accidentally published around 10,000 names and addresses from its online database. PaymyPCN.net, the website that is a \"key player in the collection of parking charge notices (PCNs)\", was offline due to Sky News contacting them, but not before the list of 10,000 motorists' information was public for the duration. The company is said to use encryption to safeguard drivers' privacy and account details but the accident occurred when one motorist was sent an unrestricted link to it by mistake. The motorist quickly forwarded this to lawyer Michael Green, who mentioned the incident via Twitter. Aside from names and addresses, pictures of the actual motorist and their vehicles that were seized by law enforcement agencies were also available when the database went public. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) said that the error was not their doing and that they don't hold such information that was leaked from the database.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/pUq7c18.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=981500]Premortal[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2282311]Virule[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]PS4 Firmware Update Rumored to be Released in March[/color][/b]\nThe last major firmware update for the Playstation 4, update 2.00, was released back in October 2014. Recently, official Playstation Blog manager Fred Dutton commented that the next large firmware update isn't too far off in the future. It was later mentioned by Tidux, a twitter user who has accurately leaked information regarding Playstation 4 updates in the past, that the release of the update is set to occur on or around March 29th. Many Playstation 4 owners are hoping this next update comes with the ability to copy songs on a hard drive and organize different folders on the system. \n\n[b][color=white]New Destiny Patch Fixes Ammo Bug and Other Issues[/color][/b]\nDestiny has now introduced its 1.1.1 update to the game. Notable changes that took place in this update are updated weapon balancing and a fix for a bug involving heavy ammo. Some other changes found include the addition of matchmaking to Destiny's Weekly Heroic Strikes  and making the checking of in-game reputation easier for players. Players who were playing Destiny when it went live were ed off and prompted to download the update. The list of all changes that took place in this most recent update can officially be found [url=https://www.bungie.net/en/News/News?aid=12607]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Games with Gold for March Announced\n[/color][/b]The games that will be distributed for free to Xbox LIVE Gold members for the month of March have been announced. On March 1st, Xbox One owners will be able to download [i]Rayman Legends[/i] for free. From March 1st through the 15th, [i]Tomb Raider[/i] will be available to Xbox LIVE Gold members on the Xbox 360, most likely to begin gaining momentum for the release of [i]Rise of the Tomb Raider[/i] on the Xbox One later this year. From March 16th through the 28th, Bioshock Infinite will be available for free to Gold members, rounding out the month of March for Games with Gold. Due to the high amount of downloads thus far of Games with Gold, Microsoft has decided to celebrate by doubling the amount of games that will be available in April. Xbox LIVE Gold members will have 2 free Xbox One games and 4 Xbox 360 games made available for them that month.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Date for the Week of February 27, 2015:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Rugby 15 - Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Playstation Vita, Xbox 360 - February, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Rustbucket Rumble - PC, Mac, Linux - February 25, 2015 \n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Pneuma: Breath of Life - PC, Xbox One- February 27, 2015 \n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Resident Evil Revelations 2 -- Episode 2 -Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Playstation Vita - March 3, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]White Night - Playstation 4, Xbox One, PC, Linux - March 3, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Helldivers - Playstation Vite, Playstation 3, Playstation 4 - March 4, 2015\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*]Zombie Army Trilogy - Playstation 4, PC, Xbox One - March 6, 2015\n[/list]\n\n[align=center]Gaming Video of the Week \n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKczTnI4_LQ[/video]\n[/align][/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/hkHBi7z.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \n\n[b][color=white]Google Is the Highest Bidder in the Domain .TLD Auctions, Buys .App[/color][/b]\nSince 2012 when the new Top Level Domains (TLDs) were announced, major players in the internet realm have been bidding on whole TLDs. Well, it appears that Google is the highest bidder in history with the recent purchase of the .app TLD for $25,000,000. They will probably use this to their advantage as they are now a domain registrar and have a few other TLDs such as .soy and .new. Hopefully this will be something they can promote to Android App developers.\n\n[b][color=white]The Aircraft of the Future Will Be Flown by the Mind[/color][/b]\nIn Portugal, a company known as Tekever has been working diligently to make drones controlled by the human mind. They have finally succeeded. The drones work by allowing pilots to think of certain positions, as if on a screen to steer the drone. The training takes a few months according to the company and is great for people with disabilities such as paralysis. They also went further to say they believe this is the future of flight and in the future hope to be controlling commercial airliners with brain power alone.\n\n[b][color=white]Net Neutrality Is Passed into Law, ISP Flaunt Lawsuits and other Threats[/color][/b]\nGood news everyone, Net Neutrality was passed into law! Unfortunately however, big companies such as Comcast and Verizon wish to eliminate our social harmony online, and force companies such as Netflix to pay more because they are popular and people want to watch Netflix. How do they plan to do this? By means of lawsuits and harassing Congress until someone will hear their whiny arguments and take enough money to try to get Net Neutrality revoked. Luckily for us, Obama is in favor and will veto any bill that comes his way, but we may not be so lucky with whomever is the next in office. 4 million spoke out against fast lanes online before, and we need more. The war on the ISPs has just begun in the name of an open internet, and the first battle has been won.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
