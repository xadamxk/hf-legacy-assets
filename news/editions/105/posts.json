This was due to the firewall triggers spontaneously blocking everyone. This did cause a bit of confusion, particularly among the Indian members, whom feared, due to rumours, that India had been added to the country block list.

It's a pleasure to be interviewing you today. Any shoutouts before we dive into it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, I'd like to give a big shoutout to Yellows (Phegget), SoulZeh, νιятυαℓнα¢кєя, and Chum!.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I'm sure they will be happy to see those shoutouts. I'll start off with one of the classics; what brought you to HF, and what attracted you to continue visiting day-in, day-out?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Well, I got into the Gamertag market, and went on the forum ModdedGame to sell my OGs and accounts. I was recommended to go here by a lot of the members there, and Staff. Once I came, the Marketplace and the community is what makes this place so addictive for me, too addictive honestly.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Ah, sounds interesting. I gather you've acquired various marketing skills and tecniques over your time on HF, and other forums. Are you still a marketer, what attracts you to marketing, and what tips can you provide to those that are failing in your footsteps?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, I mainly spend my time buying and reselling, which is extremely easy for massive profit. The money is what attracted me, it's all about the money. The best thing to do (IMO) if completely new to marketing, would be to gain hype for your product. Hype makes the world go round. On any site like Ebay, HF, or Craigslist, it's 50% how you present your product, and 50% of the product's quaility.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I completely agree with your point in relations to product tips. Nobody's going to buy a product that looks crappy, and nobody's going to revisit if the product [b]is[/b] crappy. \"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.\" This is a quote by Martin Luther King, Jr. in relations to America's military spendings. I know this question is in relation to America, but it relates directly back to all Governments in some form or another. What are your views on this topic of Government 'protection', as a whole?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: If the Government just dropped dead right now, we'd have chaos. The idea of a Goverment, is great. They are techinally protecting us, and doing a good job. But with power, there will always be corruption. People using the term \"Protection\" in other uses besides what you'd general believe. When I say that, I mean in regards to them using hype and the media to shift our opinion, by making us scared. By saying their \"Protecting\" us, while in reality they're just scaring us to pass a upcoming law. (Such as using the hype from the Batman shooting, for the gun control laws trying to be passed.)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Perhaps it's for the greater good, and as I've heard a boatload of times before, eradicating corruption won't sustain a country. I suppose we'll move off-of the politics, and more onto you. You're currently in 8 usergroups, excluding HF Ub3r. How do you manage to stay active and contributing in so many groups, and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: I do all my work on my PC, I sit on my butt for hours working and what-not. While I work, I browse HF and 4chan. I can see how it's hard to get into a lot of groups, but it's honestly not hard to keep up with the activity. Giveaways are something I love to do, I don't mind sharing the wealth, and if you share you 4k$ group with me, I'll share my stuff with your group. I love giving, and I love helping. I don't go to school, so I love doing little projects for groups such as making tutorials and programs. Gives me something to do, and it's a good cause. In a nut shell, I love to assist HF, and I can do it while I work. It's extremely enjoyable to be in groups, the people are great. It makes the HF experience a lot better.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Did I hear 4chan? *sigh*. Great to see you participating so vividly, though. What current projects are you working on, and where do you want to go with your HF life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: I am doing to same stuff I've been doing, nothing new. Looking to buy stuff bulk, and sell for profit. The only other thing I can say, is a expoilt we (the user Chum! and I) have almost perfected, which lets us get Microsoft Points on the daily, with no work at all. On HF, I plan to buy a group, either with VirtualHacker, or alone, and perhaps return to HF's amazing  Marketplace, as I now use another site for most sales. I don't think my HF life will ever end, unless HF ends.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Well, I for one would be excited to see a new HF group. Good luck with the completion of the exploit, and your future marketplace schemes. What do you think the benefits, excluding money, of being involved with HF are?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: The community. HF has it's own community, no others are like it. Everyone is nice and willing to help, once you get passed the lots of trolls. I've learned so much from many users, and shared many moments crying laughing with them as well. TinyChat is a blast, and Skyping people is too fun. The funny comments people make just crack me up. HF's general sense of humor, is my sense of humor. Though there are some complete anuses, they're still a lot more really cool people.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: The community is definitely... unique. Another interesting topic in the headlines recently is revenge. It's sweet, without a doubt, but what do you think it accomplishes? Some say it was coming, some say an eye for an eye will make the world go blind, yet it's based on cultures and beliefs I suppose. What is your mindset towards equal revenge?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Revenge will always occur, but I believe if you do something horrible, you deserve punishment. Not directly from whom you've done the horrble deed to, but from anything. Justice should always be served, and if you do something bad, I personally believe you deserve to be scolded for your [i]dirty[/i] actions, rather then being unpunished, and not taught a lesson. Peace is a beautful thing, but some people just do horrible stuff, and deserve some sort of punishing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I agree, to a certain extent. If you could improve or implement 2 things on HF, what would they be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: I'd improve the stat system, to hide your stats such as postcount, groups, and warning precentage, as that's no one's business, and nothing to be proud of. And I'd add POW3R and the vouch system ASAP. Other then that, off the top of my head, I can't think of anything. Omni has done a wonderful job to maintain what it needs, to be #1.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Well Pali, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. This'll definitely be an edition that'll get the SRPP-heads excited! And final thoughts, comments, or advice before I let you go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=879431][color=white][b]Pali[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, anus, and thank you for interviewing me. :) Looking forward to seeing the HF News, as always.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848]Jinu[/url][/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Welcome, Jinu, to the 105th full edition of the HF News! It is, as always, an honour to have a member as prestigeous as yourself with us today. It's tradition to kick interviews off with shoutouts to their loyal HF colleagues, so shoot if you have any.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, I would like to give a shoutout to Christy. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: I'm sure Christy will be happy to see a shoutout. Having been with HF for almost 2 years, I'm sure you've gathered your fair share of memories and noteable moments. What are some prominent ones that have stood out, and have lead you to be the contributing and quality member that you are today?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: Well, I can tell when i got in to Red Lions group. That was my first group ever that lead me to  as a contributing member as well as a HQ member.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Yes, Red Lions has produced their fair share of quality members over its time. While we are on the topic of usergroups, you are personally a member of 5 (excluding Ub3r). How did your memberships to each of these groups come aboard, and how has each one, respectivally, shaped you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: Each group has seperate policies and rules I should keep obey them. I have learned many things from each one of the groups.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Sounds good. What are the highlights, or standouts of the site, if you will, that you have noticed? What keeps you coming back, and what attracts you to certain subforums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: Actually I'm addicted to hackforums. We can say HF is not only for hacking, it's all in one.We can learn many things here. And people are daily posting many hacking tuts, graphics tuts, moneymaking methods, holding  contest and more. That brning me to come back and the group stuffs attract me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Haha, well I'm sure you're not the only one. You're most active, excluding group subforums, in the [i]Free Services and Giveaways[/i] section. What things do you contribute to that section, and how do you come up with them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: I like  \"Free Services and Giveaways\" section very much. Who don't want the free stuffs? So i have lots of posts there. And i have contributed lots  such as like eBooks, Premium accounts, free services and much more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Always nice to see. What experience, if any, do you have with coding languages? How did you learn, and what inspired you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]:  I don't have that much knowledge in coding. But i have learned some basic things about codings. And i have learned wide area in hacking. I've learned it by tutorials and some of helping minded people. Setting up RAT inspired me very much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Alright. How did you come to HF originally, and where do you see yourself (in relation to HF) in the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: I came here by searching about hacking. And I'll see myself as a good coder as well as a hacker in the near future.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Hopefully you go where you aspire. Technology is but extending. What are some technology advancements that have you awe-struck, and where do you see technology in say... 15 years?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: Thank you. Yes technologies  are extending day to days. In graphichs technology insome case still I'm strucking with it. I can't explain technology in 15 year because it will be extremely improve.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Well... hopefully it's used for good rather than evil. Do you think social networking is taking over real-life socialism? If so, do you think this is for the best? Why/why not?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]: Yes it's taking over  real life socialism. But is this a good thing? I personally don’t think so.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#0066FF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: It's definitely a two-sided conversation, to say the least. Anyhow, thanks for joining us today Jinu. Any final thoughts/comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=463848][color=white][b]Jinu[/b][/color][/url]:  I would like to thank you for considering me worthy enough for an interview, and to  members of HF who helped me a lot.

For those that are unaware, in the '48 Mexico City Olympics, various nations around the world were challenged with the movement of the civil rights cause. The image of Australian sprinter, Peter Norman, aside two black Americans, was described as one of the most influential images of the 20th century. The image shows the two black Americans giving the Black Power Salute, while Norman stands in solidarity, hand over heart, wearing a badge which supports the cause. Norman was blacklisted, and later quit athletics in protest. Norman died in '06, hadn't participated in any Olympic event since, and wasn't even invited to the Sydney 2000 Olympics (home nation). The Australian Government is pushing for an apology over the coming weeks, while the whole nation waits in anticipation and remembrance.\n\n[color=white][b]Afghan Attacks Influence NATO Policy Shift[/color][/b]\nThis week, there was further global outrage in relation to various attacks launched by the Afghan forces, which influenced a policy shift among NATO and American forces. This shift is to provide a new emphasis on the protection of these forces, and to eliminate the likelihood of threats. Among the various changes, American and NATO forces must now carry a loaded magazine in their weapons. Alongside this, all missions or meetings of the Afghani troops must be supervised by one or more American soldiers. The program and movements rely on trust and cooperation, but based on the fact that only a small bundle of the 31 attacks this year were result of Taliban activity (hence anger still fluctuates out of the direct enemy), the current level of trust may just not be enough.\n\n[color=white][b]Syrian's Government Regime Going All Out Against Rebels[/color][/b]\nA Syrian warplane bombed a partially controlled Anti-Regime town, near the border of Turkey, Saturday, August 18th. The bombing killed eight people, and wounded over 20. This is the most recent attack by President Bashar Assad and his Government. The regime are using more and more attacks via warplanes to thrive in the Civil War. This is one of the many attacks that show Assad’s Government is willing to do anything to survive. Killing civilians does not seem to be an issue for the Government, activists say.  \nIn other violence, regime forces have shelled across the entire country, hitting hard on rebel-dense areas. There have been an estimated 15 deaths from these bombings. Syrian rebels have retaliated by committing numerous violent acts, including, but not limited to: kidnapping, extortion and execution. According to Syrian rebels, an estimated 10 regime soldiers have been murdered in retaliation to the past week's bombings.  The UN is watching closely for any signs of escalating violence.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nEarlier this week, among the hype of the rumoured iPhone 5, Apple has been caught out for yet another vulnerability. The vulnerability is SMS related, and lies in the header of a SMS. This vulnerability consists of both the source number and the destination number. Pod2g, an infamous hacker, and self-proclaimed \"iOS security researcher\", tweeted earlier this week that the iPhone can only track the destination number, and cannot track the source. With this vulnerability public, phishing and spoofing has been made possible. This has been detected in both iOS 5 and iOS 6 Beta.

It is important to keep in mind that Surface RT tablets that are built with ARM processors will fail support older legacy software on Windows 7, while Windows 8 Pro tablets are powered by Intel processors and will run older versions. During a voice interview, Bob O'Donnell said \"Probably a little over 3 million, both [Intel] x86 and ARM (in relation to manufacturing numbers). There could be two ways to get Surface. Buy it outright for, let's say, $599. Or $199 for a two-year subscription and you can get X,Y, and Z -- which, oh, by the way, works out to more than $599.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Sony[/b][/color]\nAfter finding global widespread success with the new Xperia series smartphone [i]Sony Xperia P[/i], Sony has decided to release the Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) update. The company's blog stated that users will be notified of the update over the coming weeks. Sony says that this update will provide an enhanced lock screen, better data handling, and widgets. It's also expected to improve the media experience of the Sony Xperia P, introducing Walkman, Album and Movies apps.  \n\n[color=white][b]eBay[/b][/color]\nIn an effort to \"build trust in the marketplace\", eBay has released plans to ban the sale of an apparel of magic related services, and a small variety of magic-related products. Among the bundle are: spells, magic potions, hexes, psychic readings, blessings, curses, conjuring and all other magic-related services. This policy update will come into effect from September, 2012. This means that the sale of Genie potions for $131, or Haunted Blessed Life Bracelets for almost $100,000, will be prohibited starting September.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbjo5C8ZAaCfSc.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Chris Brown’s Lawyers Respond to Nightclub Brawl Lawsuit[/b][/color]\nThe legal team for R&B celebrity Chris Brown is awaiting their day in court after their client was named in a $16 million lawsuit for his part in the notorious bottle-throwing scuffle at an NYC night club W.i.P. in June. While Chris Brown’s attorneys seem unfazed by the suit, Drake’s legal team has yet to comment.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of The Week:[/b][/color]\n[spoiler]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDeoVnhX9cg[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=white][b]Member Submitted Videos:[/b][/color]\n[spoiler]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZu2CnnoK3E[/video]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQZMaG1eO74[/video]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1JJkMD1hE4[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n--\nI just felt I would use my space this week to thank all of the members of my team. They all contribute to these wonderful weekly news editions, and are all outstanding people.

With the top three athletes spoken about in our country being Usian Bolt, \nJessica Ennis, and Mo Farah. One performance I particularly liked was Oscar Pistorius'. He \nshowed true courage going against non-handicapped athletes with his 'blade runner' legs. He, \nin my mind is a true Olympic legend. The Olympics this year, in my eyes has really done what \nit was supposed to. Bring nations together and put sports at the forefront of everyone's minds. \nAnother thing I find that has been a major move forward in the Olympics, is womens boxing, \npreviously not available. I find this a true step forward from inequality among genders. I am \nlooking forward to the paralympics now anyway! And I wonder whether Rio 2016 can match up \nto the UKs Olympic games.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=823754][i]-McDork[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think the Olympics is a great way for athletes to perform to a wider community, \nand brings the viewers interest in sports that they usually wouldn't remotely care about. I think \nit brings nations together well, and although the IOC still has advancements to be made, they are \nbringing the world together in solidarity. The fact that this is the first time that every single nation \nhas had female representatives is a prime example of how well the world is ridding favouritism and \nprejudice, which I'm more than ecstatic to see.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][i]-Phytrix[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I love the Olympics because of the variety of sports that are broadcasted. I love watching \nsports that aren't regularly shown on T.V, for example swimming and badminton. It's pretty cool \nseeing other countries compete too, just the multiculturalism I guess. I think that the opening & \nclosing ceremonies are an utter waste of time and money. The Olympics purpose is sport, not One \nDirection singing and a few gangsters rapping with lights and fireworks. I think that the opening & \nclosing ceremonies should be about sport or they shouldn't even have them. It's like every four \nyears they are trying to compete with each other and put on a better show, but it's become a \njoke in my eyes.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=931610][i]-Hello Friends[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think the Olympic's have been great to have in Britain as they're just about to finish, \nand I look forward to the Paralympics I like the way with the current economy in Great Britain and \nparticularly in London area so many new jobs have been created by the Olympics. I believe England \nhave done a job as such by hosting the Olympics the games themselves we're good to watch and the \nbuild up to the games was also fun with the torch going around the country etc.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1119610][i]-Winner[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"What do you think of \"Curiosity\" and our exploits on Mars?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i.minus.com/jbatvBgH1Vli7e.png[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/isMS6hmWQW6Xj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j1AUE1oYr068J.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.minus.com/imOApeWOtEafO.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.minus.com/i3rfZ27rBuYhp.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jboTqTPiJCRRa2.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center]\n[i]Please Give Feedback on the Sound Quality, GFX, and Length.[/i]\n[video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SivxOv5gx6s[/video][/align]\n\n[hr]\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbxAIvN3j9rdSS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/WpABi]OnTheFly[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second\n[*]Webshow[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/Y2HFq]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/qrCWl]Phytrix[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/ZmQPe]Mr. Anderson[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/BTW8B]ρяιη¢є[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/CNcVT]Bay[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewer(s)[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/qrCWl]Phytrix[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editor[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/fhjtL]Barneyyz™[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/ZmQPe]Mr. Anderson[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/qrCWl]Phytrix[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
