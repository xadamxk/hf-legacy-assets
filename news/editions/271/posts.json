Authenticator does NOT backup your 2FA accounts which will result in a locked out account if you get a new phone, lose your phone, or delete the app. It's becoming a trend to where members are getting locked out of your account so please don't be one of them. Switch to Authy, you'll be able to access the 2FA accounts on PC or mobile and they backup your accounts. It's a safer method of using 2FA and highly recommended. [color=#ff3eab]Omniscient[/color] also recommends that you store the code you need to enter when you first activate 2FA somewhere safe incase you ever get locked out.[i][size=x-small][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5094498] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Omniscient's QnA[/color][/b]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2936055]Green crack[/url] posted a thread asking members what questions they'd ask [color=#ff3eab]Omniscient[/color] if they were given the chance.

Initially, Whatsapp was asked to share information to help in an on-going case. Whatsapp refused. Whatsapp's refusal led to all of Whatsapp's services being temporarily banned in Brazil by a judge in Sao Paulo, causing disruption to half of Brazil's population. The temporary block lasted 12 hours instead of the initial 48 hours due to overwhelming angry users, who demanded that the services was to be reinstated at once. The ban was lifted by judge Xavier de Souza in a higher court than the initial judge. The actions of the initial judge caused an outrage especially in congress. Mark Zuckerberg said he was \"stunned\" as the judge would punish millions of people in Brazil due to Whatsapp protecting people's data.\n\n[url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/12/18/crooks-update-their-exploits-have-you-updated-your-office/][b][color=white]Booby-Trapped Documents Used to Spread Malware[/color][/b][/url]\nBe extremely careful when opening documents from unknown sources. Exploits transported within Microsoft Office documents has become considerably popular recently. The new exploit dubbed CVE-2015-1641, crashes the application and allows cyber criminals to install malware without any consent. This new exploit has become increasingly troublesome and ranks just below the exploit called CVE-2012-0158. Unlike exploit CVE-2012-0158, exploit CVE-2015-1641 does not have to be executed by a user viewing a webpage which would then lead to remote code execution. Booby-trapped documents are typically sent out through email messages made up of multiple combo lists. Microsoft is yet to publish any workaround.\n\n[url=https://threatpost.com/google-search-rankings-prefer-https-by-default/115672/][b][color=white]Google Puts HTTPS Pages First[/color][/b][/url]\nThe biggest search engine yet, Google, recently announced that they naturally look for more HTTPS pages by default rather than HTTP pages. The biggest difference between HTTP and HTTPS, is HTTPS' encryption. Even if both are present on the domain being crawled, Google's search ranking will be heavily opted to pick the HTTPS page instead. Later on in the same announcement, Google had also said that the preference depends on a number of things such as: there is no redirection to an insecure HTTP page, a valid TLS certificate is present and crawling is not being blocked.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/HackingNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Inveno.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/12/how-to-hack-instagram.html][b][color=white]Whitehat Hacker Gains Access To Instagram's Server & Admin Panel And Is Threatened[/color][/b][/url]\nA senior security researcher at Synack discovered a series of security vulnerabilities and configuration flaws, which allowed him to successfully gain access to sensitive data stored on Instagram's servers. Wesley Weinberg reported the security vulnerability to Facebook and instead of offering him a reward for his findings, Weinberg was shocked when he was threatened by Facebook with suing; for intentionally withholding flaws and information from the Facebook team. Weinberg discovered an RCE (Remote Code Execution) bug in the way it processed users' session cookies that are generally used to remember users' log-in details. Exploiting the vulnerability, Weinberg was able to force the server to vomit up a database containing login details, including credentials, of Instagram and Facebook employees. Fortunately (or unfortunately?), the passwords were encrypted with 'bcrypt', which means Weinberg was only able to crack a dozen passwords that were very weak in just a few minutes.\n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/12/airline-tickets-hacked.html][b][color=white]$150,000 Stolen From Airline's Website By 19-Year-Old Hacker[/color][/b][/url]\nA 19-year-old from Heiolongjiang, north-east China, managed to hack into a Chinese airline website and illegally downloaded 1.6 million passengers' booking details. The hacker, identified as Zhang, went on to use this information to successfully defraud hundreds of customers by convincing them that there was some issue with their flight bookings and needed to pay extra fees. As a result of Zhang's actions, the airline lost almost 80,000 Yuan, which is equivalent to around $12,365, due to the customers requesting refunds. The incident took place from 31 July to 20 August this year, and Zhang was arrested by the police in November, whilst in Dalian, north China. The hack was the result of a loophole in the airline's computer system. The name of the airline has not yet been disclosed.\n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/12/hacking-juniper-firewall-security.html][b][color=white]Juniper Firewalls With ScreenOS Backdoored Since 2012[/color][/b][/url]\nJuniper Networks has announced that \"unauthorized code\" has been discovered in ScreenOS, an operating system for its NetScreen firewalls. The code could allow potential attackers to decrypt traffic that has been sent through VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). What caused this bug and how long it has been there is unclear, but release notes posted by Juniper suggest that it has been in the software since at least 2012 or possibly even earlier. The issue was uncovered during an internal review of the software and user's are suggested to immediately upgrade to the new version of Juniper, since it has been patched. There is no evidence right now that whether or not the backdoor was present in other Juniper OSes and devices.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/martin-shkreli-arrest-fbi-1.3369271][b][color=#FFFFFF]Hated Pharmaceutical CEO Arrested for Securities Fraud[/color][/b][/url]\nTuring Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli has been taken into FBI custody on charges of securities fraud. Martin is better known as the man who bought up several drug companies, and then drastically raised the price of certain medications, some by nearly 5000%. While many feel his actions altering medication prices were criminal, what finally brought the authorities to his door were his actions at two firms he used to be associated with. A hedge fund called  MSMB Capital Management where he was a manager, and a  bio-pharmaceutical company he founded called Retrophin Inc. Shkreli has been indicted on seven charges, including Conspiracy to commit securities fraud, Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and Securities fraud. The prosecution claims that Martin stole over $11 Million dollars from Retrophin to pay back his clients at the hedge fund who had lost money due to bad trades. Shkreli has maintained the \"bad boy\" attitude that has drawn so much negative attention to him, and has also plead not guilty to all charges. He said \"No one wants to say it, no one's proud of it, but this is a capitalist society, a capitalist system and capitalist rules, and my investors expect me to maximize profits, not to minimize them or go half or go 70 per cent but to go to 100 per cent of the profit curve.\" \n\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35136023][b][color=#FFFFFF]U.S. School Shuts Down Over Islamic Curriculum[/color][/b][/url]\nAn entire school district in Virginia shut down Friday after receiving numerous violent complaints criticizing a geography lesson that discussed Islam. The students had been learning about the middle east, and the lesson in question focused on the rich cultural history of Muslims culture in the middle east. Students were asked to trace Arabic calligraphy, such as can be found written on the walls of a mosque, which translated to \"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\". Some refused to complete the assignment, and the subject gained national attention quickly as people from all over the country started sending messages to the school condemning the subject matter. The messages grew more numerous and hateful until school administrators closed the schools, locking and monitoring the doors as a measure of caution against possible violent retaliation. No credible threats had actually been made against the school, but administrators  and law enforcement made the decision out of an \"abundance of caution\".\n\n[url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-canada-pastor-idUSKBN0TZ1YF20151217][b][color=#FFFFFF]North Korea Sentences Canadian Pastor to Hard Labor for Life[/color][/b][/url]\nHyeon Soo Lim, a Canadian pastor, has been sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor in North Korea for subversion. The South Korea-born pastor has been a frequent visitor to North Korea, where he has done humanitarian work, including establishing an orphanage. The court accused Lim of attempting to overthrow the North Korean government and undermine its social system with \"religious activities\". The prosecution aimed for the death penalty, but the defense was successful in arguing for leniency. Canadian sources claim that there is no reason to believe any of the accusations, and President Justin Trudeau said Canada will continue to attempt to gain access to the pastor. The trial held for Lim was recorded, and he repeats his confession from a piece of paper, admitting to \"not only viciously defaming the highest dignity of Korea and its system but also possessing the wicked intention of trying to topple the Republic by staging an anti-state conspiracy\". Some believe the trial to have been entirely scripted.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The popular game  created by Riot Games has over 30 million players online daily. League of Legends is not new to the eSports scene, however, actor and former NBA player, Rick Fox is. Recently purchasing the pro League of Legends team, Gravity Gaming for $1 million, three-time NBA champion has decided to become a part of the eSports family. The team was listed for sale after the 2015 League of Legends Championship on Nov. 8. The team will be re-branded into Echo Fox before the 2016 Spring split starts. In a press conference, Fox says, \"As a professional athlete, businessman and proud member of the gaming community, I see the way that the eSports world is growing and I know we are on the verge of something massive. The opportunity to parlay my experience in sports, entertainment and gaming into a leadership role with Echo Fox is exciting and humbling. This decision is equal parts business and personal for me.\"  Fox has been a supporter of the eSports and gaming community and believes it is finally time to support what he loves. In the past the former Los Angeles Lakers player has donated to #Right2Game, which helps to support the elevation of gamers.\n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-and-htcs-virtual-reality-headset-retail-vers/1100-6433251/][b][color=white]Valve and HTC's Virtual Reality Headset Leak[/color][/b][/url]\nOver the years technology has advanced tremendously. 2016 will be the year that most Virtual Reality Devices are going to make their big debuts. Being able to see, hear, and move around in a virtual world will allow players to feel as if they were in another world. News regarding Virtual Reality Goggles/Headgear have been shared to the public in the past, however, leaks of an upcoming device have been posted on the popular social networking site, Reddit. The unofficial sub-reddit for the Oculus Rift, [url=https://goo.gl/vbzHCQ]/r/oculus[/url], is a board with over 59,000 registered Avatars. Members from the board have created a [url=https://goo.gl/OsgOpa]thread[/url] in regards to the new \"HTC Vive\", a Virtual Reality Headgear being developed by Valve and HTC. The pictures which can be seen [url=http://goo.gl/DdKPXb]here[/url] have not been confirmed to be the final product, but will give consumers an idea of what the device will look like. No official price has been announced. Oculus, the competitors of Valve and HTC suggest that their Oculus Rift will be around $350.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Gladly.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/house-senate-pass-budget-with-cisa/][b]CISA Bill Passes, Limiting Privacy of US Citizens[/b][/url]\nThe worrisome and controversy-sparking CISA bill (shorthand acronym for the Cyber-security Information Sharing Act), has managed to pass in the House of Representatives, the Senate, and has been signed and enacted by Barack Obama. In short, CISA lets businesses share citizens' private data with both government organizations as well as other businesses as long as it is for 'cyber-security'. CISA is extremely controversial among both citizens and tech firms, with companies such as Amazon and Apple being against the bill's passing. One of the big concerns with the bill is that unlike versions of the bill which have already been passed, your personal information is not removed from the cyber-security reports, meaning your digital information is openly available to these agencies upon a cyber-security report being made. CISA was passed by being bundled into an enormous, 2,000 page bill which would create a $1.1 Trillion spending plan for the government, making not voting for the bill extremely unfavorable for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n[url=http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/13/security-drone-chases-intruders/][b]Security Drone Follows and Records Intruders[/b][/url]\nWhile it may be a while before they fall into the hands of civilians, Japanese security company Secom has managed to develop a four-rotor drone that has the ability to take pictures of trespassers or unwanted vehicles. The drone even goes as far as to chase down the subject in question and nab photos, although it chases at a max speed of six miles per hour. The drone is designed to capture aerial shots of both license plates and faces, so offenders can be later identified and caught. Secom is asking for roughly $7,000 Dollars for the security drone, as well as a monthly fee to keep the service going.  The drone is designed to assist in situations where security guards or other cameras cannot get a good photo or recording of the offender in question, but it can also patrol other areas where a security guard is not present. The drone is available to businesses as of now in Japan.\n\n[url=http://makeit.netflix.com/netflix-socks][b]Netflix Socks That Pause Shows When you Sleep[/b][/url]\nIf you’ve ever fallen asleep while binge watching a show on Netflix, Netflix has an answer that will rock your socks off. Posting them as a do-it-yourself project, the company has designed socks that use Arduino micro-boards wired to various smaller components to send out a signal to your TV, and the signal will pause shows when you are not moving. The socks determine you aren’t moving by using very sensitive accelerometer software on the micro-board that is attached to the socks. If made correctly, the socks even flash LEDs when it is about to pause your program. Along with a guide on getting the electronics and putting it all together, Netflix also offers various show-inspired sock patters to download and knit your own to use for the guide.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Wires.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Ownership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1777085][b]beslim[/b][/url] sold Pirates to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1243825][color=#FFFFFF][b]Razor[/b][/color][/url], the group was rebranded to DARK.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2867762][b][̲̅$̲̅(̲̅100)̲̅$̲̅][/b][/url] is now a leader of Divine.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=863752][b]Hexicidal[/b][/url] is now the owner of The Black Lodge, congratulations.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2950309][b]_r00t[/b][/url] is now a leader of Royalty.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1812679][b]Nine.[/b][/url] is now the owner of Dawn, congratulations.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121][b]Grievous[/b][/url] is now a leader of Royalty.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][b]zSerity[/b][/url] is now the owner of Enigma, congratulations.\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5054694][b]Axiom | Recruitment Phase | [Official][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5070037][b][Recruiting] Royalty [Official Group][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5008786][b][SPECIALISTS] General Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4932933][b]Titans | Official Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Related Buy-ins & Informational Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5011893][b]Axiom | Official Group | Re-brand Inc | Leader Spot | PP / BTC / WU [$1K][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4995862][b][Divine] || Official Group || Leadership Position Available || [$900][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4970797][b]Official Group Divine[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4456035][b]Titans | Official Group[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097073][b][Official Usergroup] Dawn[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097430][b]DARK - Official Group Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097281][b]Enigma | General Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097188][b]The Black Lodge | How to join | Information[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group and Crew General Discussions Spotlight Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5099278][b]Official Group Idea (Game Design/Development)[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5095882][b][Official Group] New Userbar Poll[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Sales Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4936160][b][FOR SALE] AnimeFAN!
