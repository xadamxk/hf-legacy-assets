The man charged for these attacks has been described as a white supremacist and part of the \"alt-right\". The shooting has sparked discussion about gun control and the growing violence of extremists around the world. Since the attacks, some have started to voluntarily turn in their weapons to the police as a symbol of solidarity. Following the discovery that the perpetrator's guns were legally acquired, the New Zealand government has been faced with mounting pressure for tighter gun control legislation. Another discussion that has ignited following the shootings is the question of whether or not videos of the shooting should be allowed on websites as an Australian internet provider blocked access to multiple websites where the video was hosted. Moreover, websites like Reddit have outright banned communities that were dedicated to sharing gory images and videos.

Additionally, parents may be charged up for €500 if they send their unvaccinated children to school because they pose a risk to the other children. Like many other countries, such as the United States, Italy has seen a spike in anti-vaxxers and has recently had a measles outbreak. Additionally, Italy's vaccination rates have dropped below 80% - which is much lower than the World health Organization's 95% target. To combat this and increase the vaccination rates, the government has made vaccinations compulsory for diseases like chickenpox, polio and measles. This legislation has been implemented and repealed before following demonstrations in Rome, but the recent outbreaks in Italy and other parts of Europe has made the Italian government re-think its stance and re-implement the law. \n[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47536981]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]Over 1,000 Feared Dead After Cyclone Idai Devastates Southern Africa[/color][/b]\nAfter making landfall with speeds over 100 mph, Cyclone Idai has devastated many cities and has killed an estimated 1,000 people in Mozambique. Miles of urban territory were underwater shortly after the cyclone had passed and whole villages were leveled. The scenes overhead looked like war zones as homes and infrastructure were completely destroyed by the powerful cyclone. One of the greatest losses and a good representation of the cyclone's power was the destruction of over 90% of Beira, a city of about 500,000 people. Several organizations and countries are now working together to provide logistical and humanitarian support to the countries affected. The majority of help provided thus far has been in delivering much needed resources, helping repair roads and homes as well as rescuing and tending to people in affected areas. \n[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47624156]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]    [/color]\n\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1992268][img]https://www.hackforums.news/assets/v4/sportsnews-thornzzz.png[/img][/url][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]March Madness Begins Soon![/b][/color]\nWith the College Basketball season beginning to come to a close we begin to see the beginning of March Madness. March Madness will begin Thursday, March 21st with the opening match being Minnesota vs. Louisville at 12:00 PM CST US. These games will be held on CBS, TNT, truTV, and TBS. Duke comes into the tournament with the highest odds of winning it behind Gonzaga and North Carolina. This March Madness is expected to explode with popularity due to the Duke team's three stars who have declared for the 2019 NBA Draft: Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish and R.J Barett. This tournament is a must watch for all basketball fans.\n\n[color=white][b]Tampa Bay Lightning Secure President's Trophy[/b][/color]\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning clinched the President's Trophy with their 56th win in 73 games. They are the second fastest team in NHL history to clinch the trophy behind only the 1995-1996 Detroit Red Wings who only needed 71 games to get the trophy. With currently 9 games remaining in the seasons the Lightning have a chance of finishing with 135 points on the season and 65 wins. Their current record is 56-13-4. They're looking to keep this success going into the playoffs and get their 2nd Stanley Cup in franchise history. \n\n[color=white][b]Blake Bortles Signs With The Los Angeles Rams[/b][/color]\nThe 26 year old former 3rd overall draft pick in 2014 is set to sign with the Los Angeles Rams. The quarterback was notorious for his chokes and his mishaps as he was the starter for the Jacksonville Jaguars who recently signed 2017 Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles to replace him as the starting quarterback on the Jaguars. During his 4 year tenure with the Jaguars Bortles lead the league in interceptions and was second in fumbles. Bortles hopes to add to a young LA Rams team that lost to the New England Patriots in the 2018 Super Bowl.\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\n\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1992268][img]https://www.hackforums.news/assets/v4/gamingnews-thornzzz.png[/img][/url][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Call Of Duty Mobile Gets New Trailer[/b][/color]\nActivision has officially announced their new mobile Call of Duty game by publishing the trailer publicly March 18th.

The 21 year old Krisitan 'Konfig' Wienecke was HLTV.org's #14 best player for the year 2017, but after having a very disappointing 2018 with his new team Optic, the Danish player is looking for new opportunities playing in North America with Cloud9.

It is a compact SUV that drives like a sports car. The new design doesn't look very much like your traditional SUV's, but it is an immaculate and nice looking model. The car looks like it will have an autopilot feature, allowing it to drive on its own to a given location. The price range of the primary long-range Model Y will be around $47,000, and later on, they will release a standard version for approximately $39,000. The SUV shows to have seven seats in the demonstration, but the seven seats are optional as Elon Musk mentions. The Tesla Model Y is said to be released in 2020, with the standard version to be released in 2021.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaskUXb12A] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1705027][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/darkops-business.png[/img][/url][/align]\n\n[align=center][color=#95a7c4][size=small]TOPIC:[/size] [i][size=large]The Internet is going crazy over the new Battle Royale game, \"Apex Legends\".
