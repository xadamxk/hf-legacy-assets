It also the latest MyBB 1.8x which brings along a revised search function along with many other updates. As such, the forum is not expected to be as available as usual whilst updates are being implemented. Plugins and features may have broken due to the upgrade so we ask that you report all bugs you find. [i][size=x-small][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5027774]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Carnage in Purgatory[/color][/b]\r\nAfter the forum was backed up for the new server, only the Lounge and Announcements sections were open for posting, with no enforcement of forum rules, since everything would be lost. Those fortunate enough to be active during the migration enjoyed several hours of full on LQP. Rep fucks were handed out upon request, with several high profile members losing four digits’ worth and even some bans. Thankfully, order has since been restored.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/UserNews.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/630.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1871491][color=#00AAFF][b]Illuminati[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 positive reputation.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\r\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1057942][color=black][b]The Judge[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1474419][color=black][b]futana[/b][/color][/url] was banned.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2240415][color=black][b]Rico Suave[/b][/color][/url] was banned for ban evasion.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Vacations[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1848707][color=black][b]Pulse‎[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1007865][color=black][b]Rihsky[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation. \r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=569605][color=black][b]Intrepid™[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=black][b]DaFreak[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2342145][color=black][b]xRamsey[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1391726][color=black][b]Mastery[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2240415][color=black][b]Rico Suave[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Closures[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2005733][color=#383838][b]dye.[/b][/color][/url] was closed.[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Repfucks[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1896058][color=#00AAFF][b]XR8ED[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1057942][color=black][b]The Judge[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1474419][color=black][b]futana[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\r\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2005733][color=#383838][b]dye.[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Awards[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=579898][color=#EFEFEF][b]KillαMuvz[/b][/color][/url] received [url=http://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=63]Sticky Man[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=83]Benefactor[/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/myawards.php?awid=66]Brony[/url]...

The news came from the user on October 15 on the social media platform Twitter. The content of that tweet was as folllows: [url=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1snlj3r]“Well, I don’t know if there is really a right way to tell people this, so I guess here goes. The CT did not come back negative. The cancer in the bowel is gone, but spots have appeared in my liver. They’re not operable and there’s no cure. Average life expectancy is 2-3 years, though there are outliers that live much longer.”[/url] TotalBiscuit bypassed the 140 character tweet limit with the Twitter extension TwitLonger. TotalBiscuit suffered from bowel cancer in April 2014, but later had the cancer growth surgically removed.\r\n\r\n[url=http://nintendoeverything.com/report-nx-dev-kits-going-out-multiple-devices-has-industry-leading-chips][b][color=white]Nintendo NX Development Kits Being Distributed[/color][/b][/url]\r\nSources from the [url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-begins-distributing-software-kit-for-new-nx-platform-1444996588]Wall Street Journal[/url] claim that Nintendo has begun distribution of its NX development kits to third party game developers. There is a possibility that NX, whatever it may be, will be announced as early as 2016. NX, Nintendo’s next gaming platform project, has yet to be confirmed to be either a mobile or console gaming system, but it’s predicted that it will be similar to the Wii U in that it may combine the two system types. The NX is said to contain “industry leading chips,” which would most likely be in response to criticism of the Wii U being underpowered in comparison with other current generation gaming systems. This information is coming from industry insiders who claim to be familiar with the development plans for the NX. Official information regarding the NX isn’t expected to surface until 2016. \r\n\r\n[url=http://gamingbolt.com/silent-hills-cancellation-makes-no-sense-guillermo-del-toro][b][color=white]Guillermo del Toro Speaks on Cancellation of Silent Hills[/color][/b][/url]\r\nIt was one year ago that P.T. was made available to players as a sort of playable video game trailer for a future Silent Hill title, dubbed Silent Hills. P.T. quickly came under widespread praise from horror gamers and built excitement for a new full Silent Hill game. However, the game was suddenly cancelled after a falling out between Hideo Kojima and Konami. The famed actor Guillermo del Toro was also involved with the project and had very high hopes for it, which explains why he is maintaining such confusion at the randomness of this decision by Konami. In an interview with [url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3364524/interview-guillermo-del-toro-on-serenading-crews-silent-hills-and-crimson-peak/]Bloody Disgusting[/url] he relayed the following message: “The thing with Kojima and Silent Hills is that I thought we would do a really remarkable game and really go for the jugular. We were hoping to actually create some sort of panic with some of the devices we were talking about and it is really a shame that it’s not happening. When you ask about how things operate, that makes no sense at all that that game is not happening.”\r\n\r\n[align=center][b]Gaming Video of the Week[/b]\r\n[video=youtube]https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=jiJPXrUKFII[/video][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Interview.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Armada.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713]DaFreak[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=][align=left]\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Hi DaFreak, Thanks for being part of the HF News Interviews.\r\nBefore we jump in, do you have any shout outs you would like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to call out to the Specialists, Legends and the former RATs crew.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome.\r\nI see you have been a member of Hack Forums for around 4.5 years, what brought you to Hack Forums initially?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Well, back in the day everyone used to speak of HF as a cool community so, I joined to see what it's all about and to learn hacking. To be precise, I came here from hackforums.net which is run by a notable member on here(flAmingw0rm).\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] So it was curiosity that killed the cat in your case.  Before you joined did you know much about computer technology and hacking?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Not really. I was completely new to this field and a noob. It's HF who provided me with the right platform and resources.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Hack Forums is a fantastic resource for learning, no doubt.   Looking through your threads here, your activity has been all over the place on the forums.  Given the community offers such a diverse area of topics, where would you say you have found the most use from the site? and, Why?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] It started with the Remote administration tools section,  it's what fascinated me to learn more about advanced methods of hacking. Hacking tutorials, beginner hacking and website hacking sections helped me a lot initially and also, the monetizing techniques section did inspire me a lot towards Internet marketing\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Those are all very intriguing areas of study.  In 4.5 years a lot has changed in some of these areas as well, most notably the Remote Admin tools.  Surely you have some input towards where the community and direction these tools and techniques have taken?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, indeed. If I look back there was a lot of activity going on in there which was full of quality. It still does, but it's rare to come across. The community is now all about making money. Everyone comes up with a new RAT or a crypter which is basically just a rebuild of a source they found off the Internet. And we even have these paid RAT mentoring services. If you look back at the threads atleast 2 years back you wouldn't find this.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Agreed, and if memory serves me correctly the old RAT crew did these services explicitly.  I even see mentions to the now defunct crew in your older threads.\r\nMany years ago RATs or formerly Trojans were always free.  What is your opinion of the Paid for Remote Admin Tool suites available now, compared to what used to be available?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. I run a RAT help desk since 3 years for now. RATs crew used to be a great group and the first official group I got in. \r\nUhm, if we look back the most commonly used RATs were Cybergate and Darkcomet. Given the discontinuation of DC, there aren't really much free RATs available out there. I haven't really used much of the paid RATs out there so I can't speak for all of them but I've seen that often what some of the features these RATs promise don't work as they should. As I said, Some of them are just a rebuild of a source code that they didn't code and are relatively outdated. I still maintain that DC is a great choice for anyone who is looking out for a free RAT and most of the time, it's better than some of these paid RATs.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of groups, your a member of multiple groups including Specialists, Pirates and Legends.  and clearly member of former groups as well.  For new users what would you say is the prime advantage to becoming a member of a Hack Forums group?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Groups form a big part of the HF experience, just like the way universities have fraternities and groups. Groups offer you a place to communicate and make friendships with people. It gives you a sense of belonging and brotherhood. It entirely depends on which group you join, as we have a wide variety of groups for different skills and interests.  Some are just lounge groups, some contribute for the betterment of the community as a whole but more often than not, some are just a money making scheme for the owner.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] The sense of belonging is desired by all one way or another.  Groups make an excellent addition to the entire community as you noted.  Some existing simply to give users that sense of belonging. - The lounge communities like you noted.  where others demand either a existing skill set of their members.  That being said, before you found your way to Hack Forums, did you have any formal I.T. education or has this experience been the self taught education?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] If I recall, I hadn't even started high school when I first joined HackForums, so yes, like pretty much everyone else on this forum and the hacking community, it was self taught.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] No surprise you found your way to Hack Forums at a early age, many do.  With all you have learned since joining do you have plans to continue on with the IT security industry professionally?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, indeed. I do have plans to continue with the IT industry and I plan to pursue Computer sciences when I start university. I'm mostly interested to to create new things which make a difference as I'm a social activist. There are great things which can be achieved using software.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] You have taken to programming as well, if you could create any piece of software, what would it be?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'm not sure what it would be, since there are already a lot of software available and development going out there but if I were given a chance, I'd definitely like to create something which shall help automate things in a more efficient way especially for huge organizations and governments and something which shall easily mitigate DDOS attacks.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Always needed and profitable.\r\nWell, that takes up our time for the interview my friend, before we go, I have one last question to pose to you.\r\nIf you could change one thing within the site or community, what would it be?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Well, the community takes the direction which it wants to take but if you ask me, it has to be the marketplace with these low quality products and the RATs section along with the other beginner sections where we see less relevant content but more marketing as the day passes by.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] So maybe stricter marketplace rules?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] To be honest, I'm not sure what solution is for these problems as it's difficult for us to closely examine these products. But yes, I'd say there's a dire need to have stricter rules for example, keep all the marketplace threads in the marketplace\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#D63030][b]ȺʁɱªÐą:[/b][/color][/url] Good suggestion, perhaps we will implement something soon enough.  But as it stands that wraps up our time. any last min shout outs?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=681713][color=white][b]DaFreak:[/b][/color][/url] Shoutout to all my Indian buddies out there and I wholeheartedly thank the HF News Team for outstanding dedication towards the community.\r\n\r\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/ArtGallery.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ren.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=http://hackforums.net/private.php?action=send&uid=1775114&subject=Art%20Gallery%20Submission][img]http://puu.sh/kPx8e/6f7cd3f7d5.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/j3ZTNCt.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]We're going live in...[/color][/b]\r\nONE MORE WEEK!
