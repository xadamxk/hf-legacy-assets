You're witnessing a long-awaited first for the HF News, the interview of ex-Admin and current Staff-member, Judge Dredd. Do you have any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] Absolutely, Shoutout to my Empress bugga, iNviZ, THL, Dan., ShadowCloud, Tibit, mad, and the rest of the noobs. xD \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] You're arguably one of the original members of Hack Forums, sporting a user id in the low thousands. How has the site changed since then? Aside from a larger member base and more activity.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] The site has definitely an abundance of things to offer people of all ages, from monetizing, gaming and even just meeting interesting people from around the world, contrary to its name, its not just all about hacking.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] I see, I see: the forum has grown to accustom a larger audience.So, back in the day, how did you find out about Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] Hackforums was one of many site's Omni ran, once he had it set up I was invited over to help out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] Quite interesting. We do know from the fact that you returned straight into an Admin position that you hold a reasonable level of trust with Omniscient, what has led to this? Did you perhaps hold a position in the beginning, or is it on more of a personal level?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] I've Moderated several of Omni's sites in 2005/2006 and that's how our friendship and trust started and grew ever since.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of your sudden return, what caused you to resume your activities on Hack Forums and take the Administration position after your long absence?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] \"I am returned from the Cursed Earth, having rendered Judgement against those mutants that inhabit said land.\nShould HF.net need the hand of justice upon it, the Judge is back in town.\nBe prepared, lest ye be judged.\"\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] So it appears. Throughout your time on Hack Forums, you've gone by two other names than your current one. Would you care to share what meaning both \"Mr. Biggles\" and \"Hanzo\" had to you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] Well Mr. Biggles was from South Park, it was an episode where Paris Hilton kidnaps Butters and dresses him up in a Teddy Bear custume.\nHanzo was a character in a game called Samurai Shodown, one of my favorite players.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] Lol. Now, you have changed your username to that of \"Judge Dredd,\" citing the face of justice in the similarly named media. What caused you to pick said username? A name that strikes fear in the hearts of ban-evaders and rule-breakers.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] As the site grew users became more defiant, so I figured a little change in character will help aid in reducing such nuisance.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] Huh, well, the name surely does fit you. Although you're a popular Staff member, what keeps you around on Hack Forums nowadays?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] My friends keep me around and I like to bully noobs. xD\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] We're certainly glad to have you! With your decision to retire from Administration, you were awarded with a group of your own: Complexity. How are things going with Complexity? Is it the group that you desire?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] Complexity is progressing really well, thanks to my Leaders, and its become more then the group I've desired, its like a family now, where everyone helps each other out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] On a more personal level, many users are interested in what kind of day-to-day life you live. In what field are you employed? What hobbies keep you busy? Anything else from the real-world you'd like to share?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=4066][color=white][b]Judge Dredd:[/b][/color][/url] Let's just say my hobbies are keeping fit on a daily basis and I love my football.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249][color=#33cc00][b]Sir:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for joining us on the 162nd edition and my 100th published edition.

Today we're interviewing Ex-HF news publisher, and 4 year old forum member, The Elite. Do you have any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] Hi! I'd just like to shout out to anyone that is still on HF since 2009. Those were the days. I'd also like to shout out to the whole team at Gamurs who are still doing great things and revolutionising the way gamers will connect.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of which, why don't you tell us a little bit about \"Gamurs\"?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] Well, it was something Mike (Techno) and I began to plan in the prime of Rune Gear (2011). We wanted to expand into general gaming since we were looking to expand the site and develop a community full of gamers, not just RuneScapers. This mainly stemmed from the fact that none of the Management team played RuneScape, and it was a dying niche. Mike and I brainstormed names, and he finally came up with Gamurs, and we both fell in love with it. Ultimately, the move failed, but the domain remained with me.\nA year later, I had sold Rune Gear, graduated (accepted into Computer Science at University), and had a whole lot of free time, so I knew I needed a new project that was challenging. I was emailed about my domain \"Gamurs.net\" having expired, and immediately knew that this was the perfect time to develop a gaming forum, having nearly 3 years of experience, funding and the know-how. My friend, 99HP, who has supported Gamurs since 2011, purchased 30% of the site. In under 2 months, we were able to launch the first version of [i]Gamurs[/i]. In just 2 weeks we had [url=http://puu.sh/4zyBo]nearly 35k pageviews[/url] which was amazing for such little development and minimal advertisement. Some examples of the initial version of Gamurs: [url=http://puu.sh/1ys7V]Link 1[/url] - [url=http://puu.sh/1N3yK]Link 2[/url] Anyway, Anxtrist on HF offered to purchase the site, but instead invested. After his immense investment, we began development of numerous site features that included a full blown social network with friends, followers, gallery systems, conversations, new profiles and so much more. Once word got out about what we were doing, we secured $x,xxx in investments to continue the work. Our first launch was on the 26th of May where nearly 400 users had signed in and used Gamurs. We achieved just under 15,000 pageviews in 2 days for a site that was not even close to launch and had minimal paid advertising. Right now, we're just finalizing the site, fixing up bugs and implementing greater user interface features. We're also working on a brand new diary system, new profiles, global messaging and a private feature that we cannot discuss.\nI realize I may have went over the \"little bit about\" part, but I summarized quite a lot!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, that sounds like a lot of hard work and dedication. I'll be sure to make an account sometime. Moving on, I see you're a 2009 forum member. Tell me a bit about why you joined back then and how the forum has changed over the years.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you, it sure has been a lot of hard work!\nI joined primarily because of the authorisation codes for the RSBots.net botting scripts sold by 4reddragons IIRC. The forum has changed substantially in many ways. Back then being Ub3r was amazing, having donated a bit was such a good contribution, and the market wasn't too saturated. Now, everything has become commercial, and the \"top-guns\" on the site are found a lot more often when they show a bit of cash, so overall, HF has changed in the direction of less focus on content, and more focus on monetisation which many people expected. It has also improved in the movement towards more intellectual content rather than just leeching. It looks like more users are actually trying things themselves rather than just ripping it from someone else.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's certainly good to hear that the future generation of HackForums is headed in the right direction. I hope it continues to do so. So the HF News. Where should we begin; how did you first get associated with it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] I do recall Yin was writing it, and he had either stepped down or just stated he couldn't do it, so I stepped in and wrote one of them for the week. I was then conctacted by Omniscient offering me the job, and so I took it. I quite enjoyed doing it, it was really interesting and I thought I was doing well at it. I stepped down after a few months though, which was a good thing as it let HF News have another dimension as more people began to work on it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] And so Sir's era began. Is the HF news any different today than it was years ago?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, definitely! The news now is a full edition from the looks of it. There's so much content I find it quite enjoyable to read as it is a culmination of the events from the past week. So yes, it has changed in many ways, all positive improvements.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] That's good to hear. So what goals do you have for the future, both in real life and online?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] Well, my main goal at the moment is to finish my university degree, preferably with a 3.6+GPA, I also want to incorporate Gamurs and build an office within the next 3 years. Online, I want to extend my knowledge from 4 languages (PHP/ASP/Java/C) to 8 (Ruby, Python, C++, C Objective). Other than that, I want to continue training for a marathon next year and just keep on doing what I'm doing now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Well you definitely seem like a smart guy. So what sections can the members most likely see you posting in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] Well, hopefully the more I learn the more I can contribute, so possibly the Website Showcase to give feedback to people that are looking to improve their websites. I'm also a fan of purchasing websites, so the marketplace as well. Additionally, I'd love to help out with people beginning to program, so PHP/Java/C forums as well.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I'll keep a look out for you. If you could change one thing about HF, what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=136025][color=white][b]The Elite:[/b][/color][/url] No, I don't think I'd change anything other than the theme to be honest.

I know groups have changed a bunch since '09.

Have you got any shout outs or things you would like to say before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: No.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: How did a talented artist such as yourself find a place in a forum which, at first glance, seems to be related to hacking? (I presume your answer should apply to most leaders and some people in FBN)\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: Well I was persuaded to join HF by a close friend named Sasori who is also a leader of FBN. He wanted to open a graphics shop with me on HF so I signed up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: When and how did you discover your passion for art?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: I don't think there was ever a moment where I realized art was my thing, it's more like it's the only thing I enjoy doing. Art isn't just about drawing or painting something, It's about discovering and creating something that has never been seen or done before and allowing other people to experience it. It's essentially what humans are born to do.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Well put. I see you don't currently have a graphic shop open. Do you not do paid work anymore? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: I do but only to certain members via PM. Having a graphics shop means being ready to work 24/7 and right now my time is limited.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any future goals for FBN you'd like to share with the readers?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: We actually have some innovations we plan on implementing to our group. Can't say much about it now but I'm sure other groups will follow suit. Aside from that our current goal is to \"move in\". I'll let the readers try and figure out what that means.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Which aspect of Hack Forums do you like the most? Which do you dislike the most?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: Haha I enjoy HF's social structure the most. Omni acting as the quiet father figure and everyone else the approval seeking children hoping to be praised by their father. The rest of the staff team acting as the mother who enforces the house rules and calls upon the father when the children get out of hand. As far as disliking goes, I don't really dislike anything in particular.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Nice comparison. Lol. Let's talk about art then, shall we? What is your set up for drawing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: Right now nothing special. Just a standard laptop hooked up to a monitor with a graphics tablet and all these other things for music production. I will be purchasing a desktop this December though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have a job related to graphics? If not, what do you do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: Well I wouldn't call it a job but since I am surrounded by people who do graphics for a living, getting commisioned for work is easy. So I guess you could say I have a job in graphic design.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any hobbies other than art?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: Haha I can't really say I do other then maybe gaming. I used to play games a lot before I got my current set up. I still play every now and then.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Thanks for participating in this interview, Sai. Any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=864480][b]Sai[/b][/url]: Nope, thank you for the interview.\n[/spoiler]",

You will have the chance to play Forza 5, Ryse and Dead Rising 3. However, the event is only open to people over 18 years old. The area one/main cities will include \"Philadelphia (October 3-6), Paris (October 10-13), Toronto (October 10-13), Chicago (October 17-20), Vienna (October 17-20), Atlanta (October 24-27), Dallas (October 31-November 3), Berlin (October 31-November 3), Phoenix (November 7-November 10), San Francisco (November 14-November 17), Dublin (November 14-November 17), Los Angeles (November 21), and London (November 21-24).\" If you're not on that list, don't worry! Microsoft are also visiting 175 \"Test Drive\" locations around America, such as Universities, Malls and NFL stadiums. You can check out more information about the tour [url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/onetour]here[/url]. The Xbox One launches on November 22nd this year.\n\n[color=white][b]Battlefield 4 Game Modes[/b][/color]\nDICE has confirmed seven game modes that will ship with Battlefield 4. These include; Domination, Conquest, Rush, Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch and two new gametypes, Obliteration and Defuse. \"Defuse is a five-versus-five close-quarters mode described as highly competitive. Each player is given a single life per round, though they can be revived once.\" Sounds a little like Search and Destroy from CoD. Obliteration will see players finding a bomb that spawns \"at a random location on the map. Both teams must fight to pick it up, drop it off at one of their opponent's three objectives, arm it, and destroy the objective.\" \"Since there's only one bomb at a time, you will often find yourself going from attacker to defender in the blink of an eye. You need to be able to predict enemy movement to defend at the right place at the right time and reclaim the offensive--or intercept the enemy to reclaim possession of the bomb,\" DICE said. \"The constantly shifting playing field from offense to defense is partly inspired by American football--with the detonation of an enemy installation being the Battlefield equivalent of scoring a touchdown.\" If you are already getting excited, the Battlefield 4 Beta starts on October 1st for a selected bunch, whilst everyone else needs to wait until October 4th. The beta will feature various game modes and maps. The game will launch on October 29 for PC, Xbox 360 and PS3. An exact date for next-generation consoles has not been announced.\n\n[color=white][b]Sony Talks PS4 After Recent Xbox Talk[/b][/color]\nIn a new interview with CVG, it was said that the price is a big advantage, but the overall value Sony provides will be the key. \"Price isn't everything. It's an advantage, but it can move over time,\" Gara said. \"Value to the consumer is everything, which is price and quality of content for that price. We feel in very good shape on that front. We're really pleased.\" This comes after Xbox's Albert Penello said that Microsoft is not stressing the price due to the services that Microsoft will be offering. \"I think we do more. I think our games are better. I think as people start to experience Kinect and see what it can do using voice, I think that's better,\" Penello said at the time. \"I think the ability to have an all-in-one system where you can plug in the TV, that's better. I think we'll have a better online service.\" \"I just believe that we're going to have a better system. $100, when you're talking $400 vs. $500 [shrugs shoulders]. I don't believe it's going to be the deal-killer,\" he added. It seems both companies are not worried about their prices and that the value the consoles provide will be the main decision on whether gamers buy their console. The Xbox One launches on November 22nd and the PS4 will hit North America on November 15.\n\n[color=white][b]China Lifts 13-Year Console Ban[/b][/color]\nThe Chinese Government has announced that they are lifting the console ban currently in place. This news will end the 13-year ban that stopped consoles from being sold. It is said that companies operating in China's new free-trade zone will be able to sell products, including consoles throughout China, as long as they are approved by the Ministry of Culture. However, even though the ban was lifted, gamers could still have gotten a console from private retailers. The ban was put into place in 2000 over concerns that gaming consoles can potentially cause harm to the physical and mental development of children. \n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nIntroducing, Xbox Fitness - only on Xbox One. \"Work out smarter with famous trainers.

Accepting people regardless of their gender, race, or age, they've stated that doing so has brought upon some great personnel in the previous years. That being said, the Minecraft developers will without a doubt have something to look forward to this year in terms of the broadcasting of Minecon. In case you're interested in applying for such a position, they've decided to make doing so easy by putting out [url=https://docs.google.com/a/mojang.com/forms/d/10IFbNrXDKsUujJYehTCQO-Z8P9m7SOMMtlNjn_dDOzc/viewform]an application[/url] for users to fill out as they wish.\n\n[b][color=white]Plastic Pack Coming to Minecraft: 360[/color][/b]\nWith the recent releases of texture packs to Minecraft's Xbox Edition, developers have decided to bring forth a texture pack that you'd often see on PC-- The Plastic Pack. Such a texture pack simplifies Minecraft in such a way that nothing looks pixelated anymore, thus giving it more of a modern feel. Found [url=https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/382940139657641984]in a Tweet[/url], one can see the clear readiness of release for the upcoming texture pack.

NASA recently announced in the journal [i]Science[/i] that they found water in the soil covering the entire planet. Heating up soil samples collected by the rover to 835C, the on-board science lab was able to identify 2% of the soil was bound water particles. This came as a surprise to scientists who knew water remained in the Martian polar ice caps and earlier this year found water-formed clay deposits. “We tend to think of Mars as this dry place – to find water fairly easy to get out of the soil at the surface was exciting,” said lead author on the [url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6153/1475][i]Science[/i] article[/url] Laurie Leshin [url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/26/nasa-curiosity-rover-mars-soil-water](via the Guardian)[/url]. \"When we send people, they could scoop up the soil anywhere on the surface, heat it just a bit, and obtain water.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Militants Storm Kenyan Mall Killing Over 60 Civilians[/b][/color]\nThe Shabab, a Somalian terrorist group, attacked and took over a Kenyan mall last weekend with military grade weaponry and extensive training. A Shabab spokesman spoke in a radio address to the world explaining this attack was in retaliation for continued occupation of Kenyan forces on Somali land. The Westgate mall, where the attack took place, is considered a significant symbol of Kenyan economic progression and a source of pride for the country. Fighting ended Tuesday with a final death toll of 61 civilians and 6 security officers.\n\n[color=white][b]Iran Recognizes Holocaust[/b][/color]\nRecently elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the Holocaust happened as “reprehensible and condemnable” in [url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/25/irans-new-president-yes-the-holocaust-happened/]an interview with CNN[/url] last Tuesday. This move comes as a surprise after a long held Iranian tradition of claiming the Nazi's crimes were simply myths, a stance held by Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rouhani was quick to note that “[he is] not a historian and when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust it is the historians that should reflect.” The statement also included comments seeming to reference a double standard between the plight of the Jews during the Holocaust and that of the Palestinians during the on-going Israeli-Palestinian and referencing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, “it's not acceptable to usurp the land of another group and occupy it.”\n\n[color=white][b]Missing Link in Fish Evolution Discovered in China[/b][/color]\nIn what is being hailed as “the most significant paleontological discovery in decades”, Chinese scientists unearthed a 50 million year old fossil of an armored fish in south-west China. According to paleontologists, the discovery explains that modern fish evolved from a once populous armored fish called Placoderms. Placoderms had armored plates and were prevalent around the world, but scientists believed that they were lost to evolutionary history and that modern fish (and their mammalian ancestors) evolved independently from bony fish at the time. These findings suggest our own evolutionary tree stems from the ocean domineering Placoderms.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jeykWvz7CWH2q.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]$35,000 Cinema Player Brings New Movies To You[/b][/color]\nThe company Prima Cinema has recently put out their popular player for home theater. This device was mentioned a few years ago and has since evolved. The large price tag gets you the player (able to be mounted to a ceiling or any other flat surface) as well as a 2TB hard drive for movies and other portable data. The device also comes with a fingerprint scanner as well in order to confirm the identity of the owner. Additionally, the box automatically downloads new movies for the owner to unlock and view at their leisure.  \n\n[color=white][b]Mozilla Working on Browser Mirroring for Firefox Android[/b][/color]\nMozilla is now working on a device-mirroring feature between their Android browser and PC browser. This seems to be in response to Google’s Chromecast. There aren't many details about it at this point other than a photo. Said photo shows what seems to be a device-mirror from a Nexus 4 to a Roku box. After its release, Mozilla confirmed in a statement that they were working on second screen support with several devices, but haven’t officially announced anything yet.   \n\n[color=white][b]MLB to Use iOS 7’s iBeacon To Help Locate Sights and Seats[/b][/color]\nMLB have announced that an upcoming update to the \"At the Ballpark\" application will use iOS 7’s iBeacon feature to show ballpark goers their seats as well as sights around the area. They will also be able to use the app to find coupons when you visit specific points in stadiums.  All of such is possible through low-power Bluetooth transmitters that are scattered in stadiums. This update is set for release in 2014.\n\n[color=white][b]Valve’s Big Announcements[/b][/color]\nIf you recall, Valve had three big announcements to make this week. Said announcements consisted of a Steam gaming PC, SteamOS, and a Steam controller. They spread these announcements over the week at different intervals with the operating system being the first. This operating system is based off of Linux and is seemingly promising. Valve has stated that SteamOS will be able to play all of the games in the Steam platform, which is upwards of 3,000 games. The second announcement was their Steam Box and such is a platform dedicated to Steam gaming. It is meant to act like a console would (being a living room gaming device) and thus could be popular among families. Valve has said the Steam Box would be shipped out with SteamOS installed, but it allows you to install any operating system of your choosing. They will be selecting 300 random Steam users to beta test the PC before the year is over. The third announcement was that of a Steam controller. This controller replaces the normal analog stick/d-pad sections with two trackpads which cover your movement as well as looking around. The controller also has quite a few buttons as well as two triggers. The buttons cover things like opening menus, or talking and there is also a touch sensitive area in the middle where certain spots will save and load games among other functions. These three things announced certainly go together to create a family-based gaming system for the living room.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbs8EtvfvyuYMl.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Drake on Track to Land the Second-Best Debut of 2013[/color][/b]\n..behind Justin Timberlake and ahead of Jay Z. Drake is projected to hit past Jay Z's [i]Magna Carta Holy Grail[/i],  which opened with 527,000 in July, but not past Justin Timberlake's [i]20/20[/i] which broke past over 968,000 album sales. Drake's newest upcoming album, [i]Nothing Was The Same [/i] would mark for Drake's best first week ever ahead of 2010's [i]Thank Me Later[/i] selling 447,000 copies first week and 2011's [i]Take Care[/i] which sold 631,000 copies, as well as his third #1 Billboard debut in a row. According to MTV, If \"numbers hold, it would also be the best first week for a hip-hop release since September 2011, when Lil Wayne moved 964,000 copies of Tha Carter IV.\" Well, at least hopefully, we wouldn't want the worst rapper in the game to hold that record forever..\n\n[b][color=white]Rihanna's Instagram Gets Two People Arrested in Thailand[/color][/b]\nRihanna took and posted a \"selfie\" of herself with a slow loris on September 22 on Instagram with the caption, \"Look who was talkin dirty to me! #Thailand#nightlife.\" Seemingly all innocent, right? Turns out a slow loris is a protected species in Thailand and the picture helped lead authorities to the people who allowed RiRi to take a picture with a slow loris and ultimately led to the arrest of two young men. One of the men was only sixteen years of age, they both face charges of possession of protected animals, which could result in a four year prison sentence and a fine of $1,300. Authorities also confiscated two lorises from the men. All that from just one selfie, though Rihanna has not yet commented on this issue and it does not appear that she will get in any type of trouble for posing with the loris. Following her trip to Thailand, she headed off to Singapore, where she performed Sunday.\n\n[b][color=white]A$AP Rocky Releases New Music Video Featuring Rihanna.[/color][/b]\nRihanna seems to be popular in this edition of the HF News. A$AP Rocky released his new music video for [i]Fashion Killa[/i] featuring Rihanna in the music video. The video features A$AP Rocky cuffing Ri and shows A$AP Rocky taking Rihanna on an extravagant shopping spree shouting out nearly 30 different designer labels including Donna Karan (who Rocky wears in the video), Dolce and Gabbana, Balenciaga, Alexander Wang, Dior, Tom Ford and of course, Versace. A$AP Rocky was a featured guest on BET’s video countdown show 106 & Park to premiere his new music video for \"Fashion Killa.\" The track was released as A$AP’s fourth single from his debut studio album \"Long Live A$AP\", which hit the shelves Jan. 15th.

Aww.. the rich, flaunting their cash at us..\n\n[b][color=white]Kanye vs. Jimmy Kimmel[/color][/b]\nKayne West responds to a Jimmy Kimmel after Kimmel spoofs his bizarre interview with Zane Lowe. The parody which included two children recreating a moment from the interview, was enough to get Kanye ticked off. Raging in all caps, Kanye tweeted \"JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS\" as well \"SHOULD I DO A SPOOF ABOUT YOUR FACE OR YOU FUCKING BEN AFFLECK\". It doesn't end there, he goes on to tweet, \"\nWHO YOU MADE IT CLEAR TO ME WASN'T YOUR FAMILY WHEN I WAS ON THEN PHONE WITH YOU 5 MINUTES AGO, YOU MANIPULATIVE MEDIA MUTHERFUCKER\", \"I LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW ME, I WENT TO YOUR FAMILY'S WEDDING\". Yo, Kanye, the caps bro. He also mentions how Kimmel is ugly and nothing but a \"pussy\". Jimmy Kimmel responded with, \"apparently @KanyeWest is VERY VERY ANGRY with me....\" showing not a single fuck about the whole ordeal. Kanye even got his buddies to gang up on Kimmel and shortly after tweeted \"Jimmy K. is the EVIL guy trying to keep people in a box and not want more out of themselves. He does this by making fun of real dreamers.\" At least this time no CAPS, if you want to check out the whole slew of Tweets visit his Twitter [url=https://twitter.com/kanyewest]@KanyeWest[/url].

The story isn't the best compared to the kind \nof stories I usually find myself really getting into, but it is good \nnonetheless. The gameplay is both entertaining and at times \nchallenging, and the graphics are absolutely amazing. When you \nhear the budget of the game, you can easily see the places that \nthis budget has been put in game. I wouldn't rate it the best game \nI have player ever, or the best game this year, and considering \nthe budget for the game I might have been a little disappointed \nwith the story if it was a series I had played and enjoyed before, \nbut as a newcomer to the series and franchise, I definitely enjoy it. \nIt's a great game and I can't wait to see what the multiplayer has \nto offer. Not a 10/10 from my side, but it's a good game, that \nyou can't get by.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=770060][i]-Invisus[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"GTA V. Where shall I start? Well, it was well worth \nthe buy, I'll be honest! It is the best game I have ever had and I think \nit's again pushing the boundaries with regards to high quality game-play, \nstory-lines and the real human-like features within it. I am so glad that \nplanes are back and that the game has an interesting story-line, as well \nas the MASSIVE map. That aside, the fact we had to wait for GTA Online \nwas a disappointment (I personally think it's a publicity stunt). They \ncertainly hyped it up before the release, and in all honesty, it's met all \nmy expectations. I haven't used any cheats (yet) but I am surprised by \nthe lack of cheats that Rockstar have released into the public domain. I \nassume there are/will be more cheats released, but I guess that's a \nwaiting game. GTA V is going to be difficult for other games to overtake.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=823754][i]-McDork[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I've played the GTA series for years, it is by far my favorite video \ngame series of all-time, and when GTA V came out I could not wait to \nplay as much as I could on my Xbox. From what I've played so far, it \nis a pretty solid game, with a few bugs and glitches here and there, but \nis something Rockstar really took the time to make it the best game out \nthere with nothing coming close to it. The only issues I've had with the \ngame are some textures not loading all the way and some frame rate \nlag when I am in the water or when I am blowing up stuff with some \nRPGs, but other than that there aren't any other issues. I'd like to see \nthis come out for the PC, Xbox One and PS4, so that these issues don't \ncome up like they do with the current generation of consoles as it wouldn't \nput as much stress on the system hardware. I'm not going to spoil the \nstory line but its pretty good so I recommend that everyone go pick up \nthe game and give it a go.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][i]-Roger Waters[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I haven't got GTA V, and I probably won't be getting it \nwhile it's still expensive, as it is here in Sweden. There has been a huge \ngap between GTA IV and GTA V, and I doubted that they would be keeping \nup with their competitors in game-industry, although I think they did a great \njob on that. The graphics, the story and the gameplay is up-to-date or even \nbetter, than todays games. But I've never been a fan of the GTA series, and \neven though their newest contribution to the series is a masterpiece, the \nprice is still too much for me to pay.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1205125][i]-9EH[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"How is the HF News?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i.minus.com/jw5guGK0UJsWi.png[/IMG]\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibzcnKdzoRTA0y.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jlI7s6jvvCxw2.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/YhEeAl8.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://31.media.tumblr.com/d3ebb61b852bf32c5799bf38b3f2b752/tumblr_mtr5fnTQ371qhnegdo1_500.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://mediocrecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nostalgiafinreal1.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Dave/comiclikeachainsawillskinyourassrawlikeachainsawwut.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/483465_367333433385725_1989091754_n.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/XvrQTfe.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jMd696URrubx1.png[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second\n[*]Comics[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451]Yellows[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/Y2HFq]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=589027]Stay Plural[/url]\n[list][*]Minecraft News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227]Lovol[/url]\n[list][*]Minecraft News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=956054]Emylbus[/url]\n[list][*]World News\n[*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389]drugs[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193]Connected[/url]\n[*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112]Saturday[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editors[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426]+Awesome[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=135189]Bad Meets Evil[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451]Yellows[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467]Morchid[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711]D3xus[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
