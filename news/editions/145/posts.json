If you are unsure what this means, it basically means that The Junk, Ub3r Junk, and Rep Abuse forums have been cleared and deleted. These are deleted in order to open up spaces for more resources as they hog unnecessary resources. About 1,000,000 posts have been deleted.

To get this going, do you have any shoutouts you would like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I got a few Fegelein, Owndapwn, Programmargorp, FrozenPlasma, Cloud, Aersol, Zankza, Phyber, and Daisy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] They'll definitely be happy to hear those shoutouts from you! Now to begin: How did you find Hack Forums in the first place? Why did you join the site?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Well I was searching around for a few hacks/mods, and I found this wonderful website. Then I found out I had to sign up to view it. I only was into hacking the first few months, but then I moved to the hardware section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, the hardware section is a really interesting place to be. It's actually one of the few sub forums that retains quality, in my opinion. What do you mainly do in the hardware forum, if I may ask?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I do computer builds/upgrades, advice on building/repairing, and the only hardware member to make videos. I made a thread called [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3293661]★★★ Custom PC Service ★★★[/url] which became a hit, and I help the new members to become very good at the hardware section. Other than that I do other things, but it is not as often.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I've seen you post, you really do dedicate yourself to the section which is pretty amazing. Anywho, I see you're a part of the Alliance. What sector are you a part of? When did you get accepted? What do you think of the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Right now I am in the CoCH section, and I was accepted this year. I do think Paradoxum is amazing. He help me with a lot of things. As a group as a whole, I think they are awesome. They picked a lot of good members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Paradoxum really is an amazing member... or should I say bot? It's always nice seeing the work of members who are in The Alliance because they're always so helpful around the site, and you are a perfect example. Do you have anything you would like to see improved about the CoCH section on Hack Forums? Any problems you have found with it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Without going in depth into hardware there are a few improvements. The first thing I see is parts. Sometimes we get members posting parts that is junk, it is not good for your reputation, and not good for the buyer. The second thing is posting more reviews on hardware. The third thing I could think of is more videos. I am starting to do videos, but my internet is not the best. One of the last things is that we need people to get along. I made that thread trying to get everyone to get along. Some people already know that. Lastly We need a good hardware member who knows what they are doing to be a mod. That won't abuse his/her powers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I do agree with a lot of the suggestions you have brought up, a dedicated mod may be useful. The CoCH is a very active section and it is doing quite well overall, despite its few problems. What is it about the section that you really enjoy; what is it that has kept you here on the site for all this time?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I agree that overall the Computer Overclocking, Customizing and Hardware section is overall good. What kept me on this site is because I enjoy people building the builds I posted. Some of them post pictures, I even had one make a Youtube video. When people do that to take the time to post videos or pictures, I usually REP them as a thank you. I enjoy a laugh I get from some of the trolling. Like Alienware jokes, but I really enjoy helping the members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Some of the trolls & jokes are really funny, I definitely agree with you. As a whole, what do you think of Hack Forums and Omni's work on it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] I have been on very long. Only since 2011. Hack Forums I think is going the right way, and Omni I think is really busy, but I don't know him so... Anyhow I like to say they change a few things since I join, mostly the rules, but the Welcome to Hack Forums section is gone along with a few others.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I do agree that Hack Forums is going in the right direction overall. Now, for someone who wants to build a new PC, do you have any advice you would offer them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Build a PC it costs half as much as a prebuilt, and lasts longer and looks better. Anyone can do it who can play with legos. I recommend to go to the hardware section and make a thread, or post in my thread, and look at [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3488437]my pc building videos[/url], or look at [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls]Newegg's building video[/url]. I will say $400 will get you a gaming computer if you build it. A $250 computer would get you a build to play Black Ops 1 on low settings. I would post some good parts, but people might get confused. So just head on over.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I definitely agree, if you are looking for a nice PC build make sure to head over to the CoCH section, and you may be lucky enough to get a reply from Computer Professor. Anyway, before we end the interview, do you have any last words you'd like to say?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=874137][color=white][b]Computer Professor:[/b][/color][/url] Is this before I die, in an electric chair? Alright, Thank you for the interview SkyGuy, and for helping out in the hardware section. I will keep my eye out for you. It was a very interesting interview.  Thank you Daisy, and Phyber for upgrading me. Zankza thanks for the minecraft server even though I failed at it. Cloud thanks for helping me out. Programmargorp thanks for teaching me a little in the Hardware section. Keep up that awesome work, and remember we are the last AMD Phenom II x6 users. I like to shout out to my group Alliance, and last but never least. I would like to thank Omniscient for making this awesome website called Hack Forums.\n-Computer Professor\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396]Prox[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome HF News readers, for this edition we will be interviewing the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396]Prox[/url]. First and foremost, dear Prox, do you have any shoutouts which you would like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you! Glad to be here. I would like to give a shoutout to my two main noobs, Tibit and xadamxk!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] They will be happy to hear that from you! Now, for out first question, as always, I'd like to ask you how you stumbled across Hack Forums, and why you decided to join the site in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Great question! Well, I was an Admin on a security forum my friend ran years and years ago, and I found that his site was very limited to what I could learn, so I ventured out of my forum and joined Hackforums! Instantly fell in love with it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Haven't we all fallen in love? I see you've posted the most in the \"Anime Adventures\" section. Has Anime always been something you're interested in, or is it something you've much more recently become involved in? What do you like about it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Funny you mention Anime, Though I'm American, I actually lived in Japan for 3 years awhile back. At the time Anime wasn't a big part of me at all, and I was hardly interested in it. But when I left I wanted to capture the aura and feeling of when I was back in that amazing country, and Anime really brough back that feeling for me. So to answer your question, I've been into Anime for at least 3 years now, and the art style is extremely appealing to me. I also sketch and do graphic art with the Anime art style.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] That's interesting, I've heard Japan's an amazing place... but then again so is the US! Anyway, you mentioned you do some graphic art. Do you do any GFX around Hack Forums? Do you do any GFX styles other than Anime?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] I actually do not do any type of GFX on HF. The reason being is because people usually expect Signatures or Thread Designs, and I'm more into the creativity part of graphic designing. But to answer your second question, I mainly do Anime style vector art on illustrator, but I like doing other things, just not as much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome, I've seen some of your work and I know how amazing it is! Anyway, recently, you were promoted to leader of the Empire? Were you expecting it? What is it like?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you! Actually, I was semi-expecting it. After I made the recuitment page and helped out with the members, Tibit said something about a Empire promotion. At the time I just thought I was being promotion to the \"Contributing\" rank, or something along those lines, but Tibit had bigger plans than that, and I'm happy to be a part of that plan and to improve the Group overall. But to answer your second question, it was exciting. It's not every day that you get to be a Leader of a Group. I know I won't be able to have as much free time, but I don't plan. Helping the Group has it's own rewards.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'd like to take this moment to congratulate you for your promotion, and so far you've clearly been doing an excellent job! Just don't kick me, lol. Anyway, what do you think about the new reputation system Omni is planning on implementing? Are you looking forward to it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Don't worry, I won't haha. To be honest, I can understand why Omni is implementing the new way reputation works, such as removing custom reps, but I don't like it. There are many reasons how it improve how rep is handled, such as no more abuse, no more bashing, etc, but some members actually put a lot of thought into their reps they give to be a little bit more creative and unique, but it is true that most of HF put generic, unoriginal reps, and that ruins it. So it go back more on topic, I completely understand why he's doing it, and I do think it will improve HF, but personally I'm going to miss it a lot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I must say I do agree with you; while I'm sure it is for the best I just don't particularly like the fact it's so restrictive. Do you personally have anything you would like to see implemented?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Implementing new ideas is a hard business. It can either make or break HF in many different ways. You see the suggestion section and there are thousands of suggestions that get ignored and denied. Though I have some ideas, none of which would be accepted because they aren't a \"must\" for HF. I do wish the suggestions people make got more attention brought to them, because honestly, no one really pays as much attention as it deserves to the section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] It definitely is difficult to add in new ideas without harming the site in one way or another. Moving on... you used to be a reseller on the forum, I specifically remember one of the products you resold was \"Incognito RAT\" which I in-fact purchased you. However you've stopped reselling, and I was wondering why? In addition, what do you think of reselling overall?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] Well, we can all agree that partnerships are always risky, one way or another. When I started reselling that program, the coder basically let me run everything on the account end and all he did was send me my share. Anyway, a month or so after reselling for him, he decided to make a month break from anything online to celebrate his degree. He never told me he was leaving, he never told me when he was getting back, and he didn't tell me the issues I would be facing. Shortly after he left, the account part of the program wouldn't connect to the server. I had no way of enabling it or fixing it again without his help. When people couldn't connect to the account, of course they contact me, and I had nothing to say to them besides it will be fixed shortly, in hopes he would come online. He never did. I fought off people neg reping me and opening scam reports because of this. Recently actually, a few weeks ago, he contacted me again asking to partner up again. I rejected his offer and never spoke to him again. So to put it short, reselling is both the easiest way to make money on HF, and the riskiest. Your partner could bail on you any second, and you wouldn't be able to do anything but hope it stops. I understand why it's partly banned on HF, so people like me don't get screwed over.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] Wow, it does sound like an immense risk getting into reselling, and I'm sure many readers will be thankful you've shared your experience because, you never know, you may have just saved them a lot of time and money. But, we have an interview to finish and we can't dwell on your unfortunate story, lol. So, what do you consider your favourite section on HF, and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] My all time favorite section would have to be the Anime Aventures section. Though it has a big reputation of having trolls, most of the members are passionate people who care about the art style and the culture of Japan. The atomsphere is different from all of HF, and I love how nice the members are and the respect most of them have. If you love Anime, it's a good place to be.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1121679][color=#00BFFF][b]SkyGuy:[/b][/color][/url] I can imagine it's a good place to be! Anyway... thank you for taking part in this week's interview; do you have any last words you'd like to say before we finish?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1017396][color=white][b]Prox:[/b][/color][/url] I'd just like to say thanks for having me! It was a great expereince to be interviewed and I hope the readers will find this at least semi-interesting haha.\n[/spoiler]",

The server has been revamped with a new hub and a new spawn. The old world, economy, and all items were completely wiped. Additionally, a few new minigames such as spleef, SB warriors, and war were added to the hub and the faction server's spawn is bigger and better with a brand new, larger shop. The server revamp brought a huge influx of activity, with a consistent 40+ players active on the factions server and 200 players active overall. Contributing to this activity are new players, who received a warm welcome; in fact, even some old players who quit have given the server a second chance! According to the admins and helpers, there are a few surprises in store such as new kits!

Many online passes have become FREE on the Xbox LIVE Marketplace, with many more to follow. \"As we discontinue Online Pass for our new EA titles, we are also in the process of eliminating it from all our existing EA titles as well,\" EA corporate communications representative John Reseburg told Game Informer. \"We heard the feedback from players and decided to do away with Online Pass altogether.\" \"Players will see it first with some EA Sports titles, where a prompt to enter an Online Pass code will no longer appear in-game; with other titles we are simply making Online Passes available free of charge online,\" he continued. \"These are rolling updates that are taking effect over the next several weeks. We hope players continue to enjoy our games and online services for a long time to come.\" With the discontinuation of online passes, what will we see next to replace the system? \n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft \"rounding up answers\" About Xbox ONE[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft have received a lot of criticism about the next-generation Xbox console. Good, or bad, Microsoft are listening to all concerns and questions. Major Nelson stated on Twitter that Microsoft is readying up a series of questions and answers relating to key concerns over the upcoming console. \"I am working on rounding up answers, and they look pretty good. Once I have them all I'll make a post.\" \"And yes, we are listening.\" Microsoft have assured gamers to wait until E3 before you decide which console to buy. Microsoft executive, Aaron Greenberg has said the company's E3 showing will \"get it right.\"\n\n[color=white][b]PS4 and Xbox ONE Prices[/b][/color]\nFrom reading the Sony and Xbox sections on the forums, it's clear that many members are unclear about the prices that have been shown on many websites. Prices you see on Amazon, Gamestop, EB Games or any other retailer, are only PLACEHOLDER prices. Retailers use placeholder prices so they can start taking pre-orders for games or new consoles which haven't had their prices officially announced. So, the $900 price tag people have been seeing is only a placeholder price and it DOES NOT reflect the actual price. So don't get worried over a high price. The same goes for games.  Please wait for an official announcement from Microsoft and/or Sony.\n\n[color=white][b]Upcoming Games[/b][/color]\nJun 04, 2013 - Painkiller: Hell & Damnation\nJun 04, 2013 - Remember Me\nJun 11, 2013 - Dark\nJun 25, 2013 - Deadpool\nJun 25, 2013 - Ride to Hell: Retribution\nJul 09, 2013 - NCAA Football 14\nJul 16, 2013 - Turbo: Super Stunt Squad\nJul 23, 2013 - The Smurfs 2\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1N5.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]US and Germany Urge Russia Not to Supply Arms to Syrian Military[/b][/color]\nThe United States and Germany have asked Russia to discontinue their supply of advanced missile systems to Syria as this may prolong the Syrian conflict. US secretary of State John Kerry said if Russia continues to deliver weaponry to Syria it would have a “profoundly impact”. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle asks Moscow not to hinder the chances of peace talks. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Westerwelle held talks a day after Mr. Assad said a Russian contract to supply S-300 surface-to-air missile defense system was being implemented, without any confirmed deliveries. US and Russian talks are expected to be held in Geneva next month. Next week American and Russian officials are to prepare the foundation for the peace conference.\n\n[color=white][b]US Authorities Are Looking for Suspected ‘ricin letter’ to CIA[/b][/color]\nThe letter, mailed to a CIA office that does not normally receive mail, has been linked to a man who has been charged with sending a ricin letter to a judge, the FBI said. The same man is suspected of sending a ricin letter to President Barack Obama. On May 22nd, Matthew Buquet, 38, was arrested in Washington state with the charges of sending one of the letters to federal judge Fred Van Sickle. On Thursday, the FBI in Seattle stated it had linked the ricin-laced letters addressed to a US post office and Mr. Obama to Buquet. A fourth letter also linked to Buquet was sent to Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane; the letter is currently undergoing tests. The FBI said a fifth letter addressed to the CIA but to an office that does not receive postal deliveries, has not been located. The FBI has said they are doing everything they can to locate this dangerous letter.\n\n[color=white][b]Police in Turkey Battle with Isstanbul Gezi Park Protesters[/b][/color]\nTurkish police have used water cannons and tear gas against protesters occupying a park in central Istanbul. Many people have suffered injuries, several when a wall collapsed during a police chase. Demonstrators helped a four day long sit-in at the Gezi Park to upset  plans to redevelop that part of Taksim Square. Protests of this have spread all over the country, even to the capital, Ankara. Earlier this month riot police fought with tens of thousands of people to hold a May Day march in Istanbul. The plans for Taksim Square involve building a shopping center over Gezi Park. Amnesty International has condemned the police tactics against the “peaceful protesters” as using excessive amounts of force. Clashes still continue and many are being reported injured.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Ns.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Start Button Returns to Windows 8[/b][/color]\nOne of the biggest differences with Windows 8 and Windows 7 is the removal of the Start button. A lot of people found it hard to adjust to this, but it now looks as if Microsoft have listened to the feedback and are planning to bring the infamous Windows Start button back in an update to their flagship OS. \"We've improved the way you navigate to Start with the mouse by changing the Start 'tip' to be the familiar Windows logo\" - Microsoft stated in a blog post which you can find [url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2013/05/30/continuing-the-windows-8-vision-with-windows-8-1.aspx]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Motorola's Password Pill[/b][/color]\nMotorola have unveiled an \"electronic tattoo\" that sticks to your skin and is unique, so you can be identified. Another \"idea\" they have is the Password Pill. The pill wouldn't require a battery because it would supposedly be powered by stomach acid. These are some pretty cool thoughts, but they have said this won't become mainstream any time soon.\n\n[color=white][b]Samsung Launches the Galaxy S4 Mini[/b][/color]\nWith a 4.3\" screen and a 1.7GHz processor, the S4 Mini could be the perfect phone for someone with a smaller budget. The phone was released after Samsung announced they had reached 10 million sales of the S4 since April alone. This is contrary to Apple's strategy of one phone a year, however there have even been rumours of Apple releasing an iPhone Mini. Critics have said that the S4 Mini is still too expensive to be considered a good choice for a budget-buyer, launching at £300 GBP.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1NR.jpg[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Kanye West Still Editing Album[/b][/color]\nKanye West has been reportedly tweaking his upcoming album, even though the release date has been set for the 18th of June, a mere three weeks away. He has been said to be spending a lot of time in his recording studio, in Paris, where he is continuing to make last minute changes to his album, including adding in more \"consumer-friendly\" singles. However, he has confirmed that the re-working of the album is not in response to any negative feedback, and he has also announced that the release of the album is still scheduled for the 18th of June and that there are no plans to push this date further back. In addition, Kanye West has also been allegedly working with Amy Thompson, a consultant who has helped out the Swedish House Mafia in the past, in order to boost the marketing-side of his album as he hopes to gain more sales than before.\n\n[color=white][b]Funeral For a Friend Release UK Tour Dates[/b][/color]\nThe band Funeral For a Friend have announce their UK October Tour dates, continuing their long string of tours which they had recently performed. The tour is aimed at promoting their latest album \"Conduit\", which they released earlier this year. Funeral For a Friend is a post-hardcore Welsh band, which was formed in 2001. Their debut album, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation from 2003, initially attracted popularity and through the release of albums such as Hours, 2005, and Memory and Humanity, 2008, their popularity continued to rise and they are currently one of the most sought-after bands in the UK. Lead vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye said the following to his fans: \"We're incredibly excited to hit the road again in support of Conduit and after having so much fun on tour earlier in the year we decided to step things up a little but not too much. We wanted to play some bigger shows but still retain that intimacy that we all loved from playing the shows back in January. So make sure to wear your best mosh shoes and come sing, scream and dance with us!\"\n\n[color=white][b]Announced UK Tour Dates[/b][/color]\n2nd Oct Cardiff University, The Great Hall 2\n3rd Oct London Electric Ballroom\n4th Oct Glasgow Garage\n5th Oct Manchester Academy 2\n\n[color=white][b]\"Random Access Memories\" by Daft Punk Second Fastest Selling Album[/b][/color]\nThe Electronic Music Duo's latest Album, Random Access Memories, has been accredited with the title of the second fastest selling music album so far in 2013. With a massive 339,000 copies sold in its first week of release, it is still over 600,000 copies behind Justin Timberlake's \"The 20/20 Experience\" album, which sold over 950,000 copies in its first week. Daft Punk was formed in 1993, and began attracting international attention in the late 1990s for their elaborate live shows in which visual projections are displayed as the music is played. Their first album, Homework, was released in 1997 and was the beginning of the band's worldwide success. In 2001 they released their album Discovery, which was even more popular and sold over 2.5 million copies by 2005.\n\n[b][color=white]Music Video of the Week[/color][/b]\n[spoiler=]\nToday's Music Video of the Week is \"Short Shorts\" by the EDM producer Stephen Walking. Not your typical music video, but it's funny and I hope you enjoy it.\n[video=youtube]www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNDliFODF4[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2G1Ol.jpg[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nI have found that the only way to truly enjoy life, is to give up on it. Life has too many intricacies and inexplicable components for any person, species, or collective society to define. If one takes the time and sits down, life will baffle him or her: at any moment, you could die. Then, after that--assuming you don't believe in an afterlife--there is nothing. Yet, there is nothing for you to realize that there is nothing. Simply, you disappear, and you don't realize it. You are just no longer. At that moment, every memory of life and moment in time becomes a waste to you, as you're no longer around to savor it. By understanding that, I have come to the conclusion that life is not to be understood, but to be lived. Do what you want to do. Don't care about the thoughts of your peers, or partake in the squabble of drama--unless you feel it has importance--just do what you want to do. There is no meaning of life other than what we give it.",

Liberty Reserve changed \neverything from sales to just holding funds. I feel like many members \nare worried right now, including me! The last time I checked, I had \naround $300 in LR, which is nothing compared to what major exchangers \nhad in theirs. I really hope it comes back because sellers used it so \nmuch because it had no chargebacks and no limitations. If it doesn't, \nGayPal will be used in its place resulting in sellers risking a lot more by \naccepting GayPal money.
