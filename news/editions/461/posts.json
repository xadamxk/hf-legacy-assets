Expect to see the anime during winter 2021 anime season in January. Movie theatres in Japan will showcase a sneak peek preview of the show in a short film inspired by the fifth volume of the manga. This short film will release on Sep 5 of this year. There's no announcement of whether or not countries outside of Japan will get the release. Usually, it takes a couple of months before a Japanese film hits theatres for outside countries. Will countries outside of Japan have a chance to watch it before the second season? There is no definite answer yet. If you are looking to keep yourself busy, various manga spin-offs were created for your enjoyment. If you have a specific character group that you like, you might be able to read up on them. Bacteria at Work, Cells That Don't Work, Cells at Work! Code Black, Platelets at Work, and Cells at Work! Baby, and Cells at Work! Lady was created and are, of course, reflected around certain cells inside of your body. The anime and manga of the original series were very informative. Therefore, the spin-offs shouldn't stray too far from the original series and you will probably learn a few things, if not more than what we saw in the original series.
