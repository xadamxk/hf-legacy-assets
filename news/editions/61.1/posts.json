Now, how did you find hackforums, and what got you to register?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=572087][color=#FFFFE0]Nidhish91[/color][/url][/b]: So , it was back in Nov 2010 when I was very active on Orkut , I was a part of a hacking community and I tried to learn everything posted there. People used to add Hackforums in their source link and I was very much eager to know as to what Hackforums is and finally I was here ! :D\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=401423][color=#FFFFE0]ComX[/color][/url][/b]: That's nice, so would you call yourself a blackhat, greyhat, or whitehat hacker?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=572087][color=#FFFFE0]Nidhish91[/color][/url][/b]: You can call me a grey hat hacker though I am still to explore a lot about the Hacking World. I aspire to become a Security Expert and I am learning a lot about it on HF\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=401423][color=#FFFFE0]ComX[/color][/url][/b]: Do you have any Goals, that you want to happend on HF?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=572087][color=#FFFFE0]Nidhish91[/color][/url][/b]: Yeah , I do have some goals on HF , one of them is to be well known on HF for helping people around and other contributing as much as I can for this great forum . Have some more but not disclosing them at the moment \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=401423][color=#FFFFE0]ComX[/color][/url][/b]: So, back to HackForums, is there any changes you want to see, or any new rules Implemented?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=572087][color=#FFFFE0]Nidhish91[/color][/url][/b]: As of now nothing new. But yeah I am waiting for the Vouch System to be implemented . HF will become a much safer place then \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=401423][color=#FFFFE0]ComX[/color][/url][/b]: Now that we're talking about the Vouch system, why do you want it to happen? Do you think there could be any down sides to it?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=572087][color=#FFFFE0]Nidhish91[/color][/url][/b]: As of todays date Reps are taken in wrong way in this forum. It has been misused a lot and is going worse day by day . Vouch system will bring an end to it. Also Vouch system will make the market place much better then it is presently. The only down side I see is when it comes to present scammers. People wont be able to identify them initially.  Hope Omni Has a solution for that too.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=401423][color=#FFFFE0]ComX[/color][/url][/b]: Well, I think it's about time to wrap things up, is there anything else you would like to say or talk about before the interview is over?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=572087][color=#FFFFE0]Nidhish91[/color][/url][/b]: Not much, I just want to thank everyone on this site for being so good to me always.
