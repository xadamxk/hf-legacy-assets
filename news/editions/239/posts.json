Many users were faced with the issue of having access to other users' accounts, however even though it appeared as if you were logged in to another account, you were still not able to complete any actions as it was all just an issue with the Cloudflare exploit. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] reported this exploit to Cloudflare months ago and in the end, they dismissed it. The issue that should have been taken care of months ago obviously frustrated [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] and a change was required to deal with the situation. That night [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] decided to pay for a new account with Sucuri, changed server configurations, and began the necessary changes to add their protection into our serving scheme. The remaining downfall of the situation is that NSFW might be lost, at least in its current form. Other than that the new change seems to be working just fine however [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] did state that he can already see limitations and problems with Sucuri. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also stated that changes will occur and odd behaviors will happen so don't hesitate to let him know if you experience these. For now we'll all just have to sit back and see what happens in the near future. To read the official announcement from [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] you may feel free to do so, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4811061]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]All Countries Now Unblocked Except for Three[/b][/color]\nFor the first time in about 8 years on May 7th, 2015 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] unblocked every country except for China, Russia, and North Korea. After viewing the statistics it appeared that 40% of the traffic to HF was indeed blocked. Regardless of the unblocking however [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is unsure how long it will last. If problems start to occur with certain countries it is likely for them to be placed back onto the block list. Also VPN's, Proxies and Datacenters are still blocked.

A cool little feature indeed just to make the page a bit more defined. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also stated in the thread that he will be coding some special functions for group owners to edit their own leaders.

Are there any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to give a shoutout to Cyrus, Bull, Maximum, and Adam\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Some pretty cool guys there. How did you guys get to know each other?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I've known both Cyrus/Bull for a year and a half at least.

Both cool dudes, meet adam/max recently.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] You've made quite a name for yourself recently with all those awards.

Not really haha.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Let's leave it at that. I understand you just recently bought Zero. Do you have any plans in mind of what to do with the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I've added Adam as leader and I'm going to take a back seat for awhile.

So how were you introduced to HF in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I wanted to download a keylogger back in 09 but the only way to do that was to make an account here and so I did. I got closed in early 2014 for annoying Omni and he allowed me back 6-7 months ago.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] What made you decide to stay?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not sure tbh, I've never been active for a long period of time. So I'd go away for maybe 9 or so months and come back again. Maybe if I didn't do that. I would have got bored of hf and left completely\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] It does tend to get a bit stale after a while. What's one thing you would change about HF if you had the chance?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] Members ego, I've seen a lot of members that have an ego because of their post-count/rep/award or whatever reason and tend to think they are better then others for that sole reason. And those that ass kiss them members that contribute to their egos growing lol.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] You hit the nail on the head with that one, I see that problem all the time. What's your opinion on OMC integration?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I've actually been away the last 6-7 or so months whilst the OMC integration started I remember Omni saying he was taking OMC seriously. I'd need to do allot of catching up on OMC stuff, but I hope it works out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] It's gained a lot of popularity recently with new features. That's all the time I have, is there anything else you'd like to say before we conclude this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2529154][color=white][b]TommyD:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to give a another shoutout to specialist, great group.

Both of their sources have been posted on GitHub which you can find by clicking on the source of this article. There are no GPU malware analysis tools online which makes these beautiful pieces of malware very hard to find. These types of malware run without exploiting any current processes in the operating system kernel which is why they stay undetected. It also exploits GPU capabilities by mining for different cryptocoins such as Bitcoin. These programs can spark many new ideas into the minds of hackers.

This XSS vulnerability is classified as a [i]document object model[/i] (DOM) which is responsible for images, headers, text, and links in a web browser. The DOM based attack does not change the page itself but rather the client side code contained in the page which now acts differently due to the malicious attack. These DOM-based XSS attacks are harder to find then the typical XSS attack because they are located in the script code of the website. The DOM-based XSS attack requires an administrator to click on the specific link while logging into the vulnerable WordPress installation. Once the administrator clicks on that link, the hacker will have full control of the website. It is not exactly clear on how many websites are vulnerable to these attacks but the JetPack plugin which is vulnerable to these types of attacks comes installed default by millions of WordPress templates.

Although little is currently known about the specifics pertaining to this vulnerability, the [url=https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0701]National Vulnerability Database[/url], due to its ease of exploitability and potential impact, gave the vulnerability a critical score of 10.0. The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious, custom HTTP requests to version 1.2 and below of UCS. Not only can it be performed across the Internet, but no authentication is required and still allows unprivileged users to gain unrestricted access to the machine. It is not known if this vulnerability was used in the wild, but it is a safe assumption that it was and that Cisco's quick response was done to prevent more people from being affected.

The cab company says they will be there in three hours, but that's way too long of a wait. Uber is the company that will send a driver to wherever you are in a short amount of time. Used by millions of people, Uber has been a target of cyber-attacks for a very long time, and it seems as if it has finally been executed successfully. Many customers have reported seeing drivers requested and bank transactions that they did not authorize. At first, it was unclear as to whether or not Uber was hacked or if people's accounts were being logged in due to the fact that they use the same passwords for other sites and services, but when Uber came forward about their security error, there was no doubt. Uber had left a secure database key, originally intended to be used only by a few private Uber employees, on a publicly available GitHub archive. Dan Goodin, a security analyst, has compared it to locking your house and keeping a key under the mat.

Th exploited sites have backdoor code that runs when a user logs in, then steals their credentials and sends to hackers via a GET request. The site that is believed to be receiving a majority of the stolen credentials is conyouse[.]com. The code designed by the hackers cancels the original login method and instead runs their code. The researchers urge WordPress site owners to update to the latest security patches as soon as possible in an attempt to prevent attacks such of this from reoccurring. Other widely used WordPress Plugins eShop and TheCartPress also had vulnerabilities discovered this week that compromised any data that was sent through the plugins. It was discovered that EShop had a vulnerability in its HTTP cookie, thus allowing for the data to potentially be compromised. TheCartPress's vulnerability was linked to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Adobe announced yesterday that Acrobat and Reader for Windows and OS X will be receiving security updates next Tuesday. Adobe said that Reader XI 11.0.10 and earlier, Reader X 10.1.13 and earlier, Acrobat XI 11.0.10 and earlier and Acrobat X 10.1.13 and earlier will be affected by this soon to come update. Microsoft is expected to release details on its monthly security updates later this week. In January, Microsoft announced that it was limiting access to its Advanced Notification Service, a decade-long service that provided customers a description of security patches one week before Patch Tuesday. Microsoft will henceforth restrict access to its Premier support customers and participants in the Microsoft Active Protections Program. Patch Tuesday will, however, be coming to an end. Microsoft announced during its Ignite conference that in Windows 10, security updates will be available as they're needed.

After the update, Cisco said that the is no other workarounds available and is not aware of any public exploits. Cisco is urging users to upgrade to UCS Central version 1.3, remarking that this vulnerability is a 10/10 on their severity scale. On March 23rd, Cisco warned users of SPA 200 and 500 series IP phones of a series of firmware vulnerabilities allowing hackers to intercept and listen to calls or even make phone calls. The company patched a total 16 vulnerabilities, those included, three days later.

These modifications have been allowed to be distributed for free since 2011 when the Steam Workshop was first introduced. The first game that was going to have paid modifications available was [i]The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim[/i]. However, a few days later following an enormous backlash from the gaming community, Valve decided that it would be best to remove the option for game modifications to be paid for. \"We've done this because it's clear we didn't understand exactly what we were doing,\" said Valve. \"We've been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards, and in the past, they've been received well. It's obvious now that this case is different.\" Bethesda Softworks, publisher of games with large modding communities like [i]Fallout: New Vegas[/i], had this to say about the removal of paid mods: \"Even though we had the best intentions, the feedback has been clear — this is not a feature you want. Your support means everything to us, and we hear you.\" [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/27/8505883/valve-removing-paid-mods-from-steam]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Retro Metal Gear Solid Clothing Line Coming Soon[/color][/b]\r\nOn May 5th, an image was uploaded to the official Metal Gear Solid Facebook page displaying a strangely luxurious Metal Gear Solid picture with only the text “Metal Gear Solid: The 1984 Collection.” The caption below the picture read as follows: “Step back into the 80's with our new MGS collection coming very soon! Stay tuned!” It was later revealed that this image was a teaser for a line of clothing set to coincide with the upcoming [i]Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[/i], which takes place in the year 1984. The clothing is coming from the video game-themed clothing retailer Insert Coin. The clothing available can be found [url=https://www.insertcoinclothing.com/metal-gear-solid/]here[/url] on Insert Coin’s website. [i]Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[/i] is set to release this upcoming September.

However, on May 8th a teaser image for the game was revealed, showing brass knuckles, the Charles Dickens quote \"We Forge The Chains We Wear In Life,\" the phrase “God Save the Queen,” and the word “Rooks,” which may be in reference to the birds commonly found in Northern Europe. Next to the text “Rooks” is a carved image of a bird, seemingly confirming the meaning for the term. According to a leak from last year, the game’s title is to be [i]Assassin’s Creed: Victory[/i], although this has yet to be directly confirmed by Ubisoft. The game is reported to be released on the Xbox One, Playstation 4, and PC.

Samsung typically busts out the new Note in September at IFA (International Franchise Association), but the very first rumors about the \"phablet\" are already out, and we expect to see a whole lot more of them ahead of its launch.\r\n\nUnlike last year, the South Korean technology giant may limit itself to only one variant of the Galaxy Note 5 in 2015, with the device featuring a 2K (1600x2560) or 4K (2160x3840) flat-screen Super AMOLED display. The phablet is also expected to feature an Exynos 7422 processor, Samsung's first all-in-one solution, which will include the CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and modem all on a single chip.

Samsung has begun construction on a massive semiconductor production plant in South Korea that will cost 15.6 trillion won (approx. $14 billion) to build. Dubbed “Samsung Semiconductor Valley,” it will be the most expensive semiconductor plant ever built. The plant — which is almost as big as the company's two largest semiconductor factories put together — is slated to begin production in 2017.\r\n\nSamsung is leading the way in semiconductor production thanks to a cutting-edge 14-nanometer manufacturing process that allows chips to become smaller, faster, and more power efficient. The new facility will help Samsung produce these chips in greater numbers than ever before, and enable it to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with mobile chips — further cementing its position in the industry.

Google is expected to release Android Version “M” next month, which will seemingly give control of app data back to the users. According to sources speaking to Bloomberg on Thursday, the next iteration of Android will give users the ability to hand-pick specific permissions to grant an app upon installation. This includes access to photos, contacts, and location data, according to the report.\r\n\nThe anticipated move would follow in the footsteps of Google's closest rival, Apple, which added similar security features more than two years ago.

He was a great Admin and is now a great Mentor and will always be a great Member.\"[/b][/align]\r\n\n[align=left][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1607053]Dex[/url]\r\n\"Xch4ng3 was a great person and Admin.

Being staff on HF isn't an easy job, let alone being an Admin. We all have a personal life and a lot of members get caught up in the action of HF and leave their 'lives' behind them. I have respect for Xch4ng3 knowing that he was willing to resign his job as a site admin and step down due to his own life.\"\r\n[/b][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/u9jMaRp.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[b][color=white]New Header Images[/color][/b]\r\nWhat do you think of the color coding? Starting next edition, I will have permanent colors so you can begin remember blue is Site News and such.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Community Articles[/color][/b]\r\nI've listened to suggestions posted in this thread and got a good idea of what needs to get added. Most of the suggestions were about non-Writers contributing so very soon Writers will launch a \"Moment in Time\" section where non-Writers members will be able to submit their articles and get it featured on HF News.\r\n\n[b][color=white]Changes Incoming[/color][/b]\r\nSchool is ending this week for myself and I'm sure other Writers so I will have a lot more time to push out new changes faster and more efficiently.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/bsijNbc.png[/img]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Progression of HF News[/color][/b]\r\nMany have asked if HF News is going downhill so I finally finished recording post and view count of every single edition from the very first one till edition 238. As you can see from the graphs below, HF News has been going downhill but we'll see how it changes in the next 50 editions with all these changes I have planned.\r\n[sp=View Progression]\r\n[align=center]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/4eixWGn.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/E5Jd2Ho.png[/img]\r\n[/align]\r\n[/sp]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",
