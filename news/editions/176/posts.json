Happy New Year. HackForums has kicked off the New Year with a not-so-great beginning. Witza, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s payment processor for upgrades was breached, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s HF and Minecraft accounts being compromised because of password resets, and last but not least the Rep-Fuck and bans on a few members. Everything has been dealt with accordingly and no information was stolen at all. The hacker(s) that did this were/was not able to access the admin control panel as well as the staff section. The hackers also tampered with the MOTM contest. They gave the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1812679][color=#EFEFEF][b]Ninetales.[/b][/color][/url] over 100 votes, which made things unfair. Soon enough, a new thread was made and all votes back to zero. You can read more about the breach [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3967707]here[/url] and you can check out the new MOTM thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3967429]here[/url]. So far everything is back to normal and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] left a little \"easter egg\", so to speak on [url=http://t.co/9VG3z5NkDu]Witza[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]New Rule in the eBook Bazaar Forum[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3967473][b]Ponzi Schemes[/b][/url] by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is currently the newest thread in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=136]Ebook Bazaar[/url] forum. It states, \"If your ebook is about making money by selling an ebook to make money then you will get a closed account for participating in a Ponzi scheme. I suggest everyone very quickly review the ebook you're selling right now and junk it because this policy is retroactive and any active threads I find will be subject to this policy.\"  EBooks must be edited accordingly if they contain anything revolving this new rule. There is currently no information on if you'll be banned, have your account closed, or what warning type you receive. Violating the rule and not editing your eBook accordingly will be done at your discretion.\n\n[color=white][b]New Cryptography and Encryption Marketplace Subforum[/b][/color]\nA new subforum in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=107]Premium Sellers Section[/url] in the marketplace has recently been created. All market-style threads about cryptography and encryption services or software have been moved here. As of now, there is 502 threads and over 25,000 posts. No official thread was posted, so the section might have been created to clean up the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=126]Cryptography, Encryption, and Decryption[/url] section from threads that belong in the marketplace section. All threads regarding the sales of this topic should be posted here.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jSO3vt1bm2wTp.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=931798][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tiszy[/b][/color][/url] hit 2,000 reputation points.

We're joined with Ink Heart this week. What's up man?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] nothing much, just got back from my trip.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Where'd you go? Also: anyone you'd like to give a shoutout to before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] I was lost in the congo jungle for about 4 weeks, and yeah ill give a shutout to baghead, invisuse, majha, and of course the high chief peter maivia.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds pretty crazy to me, to be honest. Hi to them! What did you end up doing for New Years?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] I spent my New Years searching for water and building a tent of straw.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Came up with a resolution for the new year? \"Don't get lost in jungles\" -- maybe?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] I plan on becoming a slum lord some time this year. I want to own my own property and protect it with a moat.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds like a fine plan. On the real though, I see that you're into graphics. Vectoring to be specific. What got you into that?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] I'v always enjoyed design since I was a kid, it's the only hobby i have ever had besides my tap dancing years. This forum is what got me into making my own graphics though, many of the members here inspired me to create my own style, and art.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Tap dancing? Nice. So tell us about yourself. The day in the life of Ink Heart. What do you do besides  trekking in the jungle?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] Well I masturbate a lot, go to the gym, listen to Howard Stern, do some graphics, but mostly I just masturbate a lot.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True. So, what keeps you hooked on the site? Why'd you join?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] Nothing keeps me hooked on the site, I come and go, but when i come back it's for the graphics. I originally joined for the SRPP section I wanted to get insight on others thoughts and beliefs, but then i realized there thoughts don't matter and I started drawing shit.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] So, what do you even use to draw? On paper or a computer. A pencil or a tablet?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] I start everything on paper as a sketch, then i take a picture of the sketch and put it on my computer, then I put it in adobe illustrator and then i vector it. it's a pretty boring process, thats why i masturbate so much.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Any tips that you can give to newbies on vectoring? Any goals that you'd like to accomplish on the site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, i would suggest they Stick with it, vectoring can be very Hard, but as Long as they keep there Head Stimulated they should Cum along nicely. I also suggest relieving your tension as often as possible. \n\nAs far as goals on the site goes my only goal would be to take omni's place, I feel I could run this place better. I would  make it into a dictatorship and force the members to give me $20 a month each to avoid being rep fucked and banned, also every new member would have to tell me there penis size.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Best of luck. Anything you'd like to say before we're done?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691178]Ink Heart[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, I wanted to mention a few things you didnt have time to ask, first I am 1 inch showing 4 inches fully erect. Second my favorite movie is The Cat Creeps by Rupert Julian which i cried during. Third I would like to mention that sometimes I feel like a women trapped in a mans body, my life goal is to be seen as the women i believe I am. Also I am a big fan of Batman.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204]Basics.[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/url][/b] Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF News. Today I'm joined with the user Basics. Thanks for joining us today Basics; Do you have any shootouts you'd like to make before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] Thank you. I'd like to shout out to two members who were kind enough to upgrade me to L33t and Ub3r in the past few years. I'd also like to shout out to everyone on HF for making my journey worthwhile and teaching me a lot of valuable information along the way. Thanks!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hell of a shoutout, one of the best I've heard. So why don't you tell us about how your discovered Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] Haha thanks. Well, a friend sent me a link to a website which distributed a RAT (a very old one too.) I didn't even know how to download it as it required a password I couldn't find (which was actually right there on top of the page -.-) Intrigued, I Googled \"hacking forums\" and HackForums was the first on the list. I'm really glad it was!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So have you learned more about hacking since you've registered?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] Definitely. HackForums has given me a new perspective about computers, how they work and how they can be exploited. I treasure the science behind it too, simply amazing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Do you have any plans for your future here at Hack Forums? Any releases or upcoming projects?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] One of my plans is to reap all the information I can from HF. I have not released anything in relation though. I'm going to try make 2014 a productive year so one day I can!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So tell us more about some of your interests. Any of which relate to Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] I really enjoy listening to music for my pleasure. I also enjoy reading up on tutorials and helping members to the best of my ability. I smoke Marijuana too but how sick are we of posts regarding Marijuana right? This track sounds really dope when smoking to it though!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  It's alright I suppose. What's your favourite genre of music?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] Well, Trap at the moment. But I'll listen to anything that has a catchy beat, my tastes aren't limited. There's always room for more!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Cool, every genre has something awesome to offer. So what would you like to see done differently on Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] I have no problem with the way Omniscient or his team maintain HF to be honest. This is a business after all. However, I wish new members would read the help documents more often. I would also like regular members to stop complaining about receiving negative reputation and on top of that, lableing it \"abuse\". Other than that I have no problem with HF. Everything is set up to my liking so far! \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I think we'd all like newer members to review the Help Doc's more, sadly majority of them don't know where to find them, let alone take the time to read them. Which theme are you currently using? Do you have a favourite?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] Still using the Old School theme, which is my favorite. Browsing HF is not the same with other themes imho, lol.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Ah you're missing out man, Modern Blue is unreal. So have you have been apart of any groups on HF? If so which one?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] But it's too.. Modern Sad. Oh, this was quite some time back. I was a member of Red Lions, Eminence, Writ3rs (Wiki) and Techsperts (or whatever the name was.) I didn't feel like I was contributing enough (time sucks) so I decided to leave to avoid becoming a liability to the group. I co-led Eminence with WiFi for a while before I decided to leave that group too. Seems to have vanished actually.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good on you, it's always better to leave a group than to stay and not partake in it. Anyway, thanks for joining us today! If you have any last statements you'd end with, go for it!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580204][color=white][b]Basics.[/b][/color][/url] Positive thinking will always lead to positive results. Never dwell in negativity no matter how tough your situation is! Thanks for the interview, Clark. Thanks for great stay, HF![/spoiler]",

The charity provides toys and games to children in over 70 hospitals worldwide. \"The bulk of our donations don’t come in the form of huge grants: the millions are made up of the $10, $20, $50 donations,\" wrote program coordinator Jamie Dillon on the Child's Play site. \"They come from game marathons, golf tournaments, eBay auctions, and bake sales. They come from the incredible community that makes the tag line 'Gamers give back' an understatement. The community coming together for 10 years has now resulted in $25,196,670. We are humbled, proud, and overwhelmed with gratitude. Thank you for making 2013 our best year yet.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft on Xbox One[/b][/color]\nMajor Nelson has stated that Microsoft is listening to the community every day to improve the new system. \"When we look back and look at what we've done, we want to continue to adapt the system to what gamers want,\" Hryb told Canada.com. \"The team that works on Xbox are gamers themselves. We want to build the system that we use and that we know gamers would enjoy using.\" \"We're going to continue to refine the system and make it what the Xbox fans are expecting and what they want,\" he said. \"We're listening to the feedback every single day. I've already seen some changes in the operating system internally with what we're building.\" If you have any suggestions for the new console, it's best to post them on the official Xbox forums or on Reddit.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nIf you haven't heard already, Minecraft has launched on the PS3. Here is the launch trailer for the latest Minecraft platform. \n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA2ZNlw7luc[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j5tt3ZeAOMRST.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Chicken Jockeys to Cause Major Lag Issues[/color][/b]\nAs many might know, the introduction of the new mob-- Chicken Jockeys-- was a definitely cool and unexpected release. It's the combination of a baby zombie and a chicken, making a cool little character that everyone is aspiring to capture. What people didn't know, though, is that they cause a very big issue for lag. Once spawned (whether the baby zombie despawns on top of the chicken or not), the chicken will lay eggs for other zombies to pick up. If a zombie picks up an item, it will become impossible for it to despawn-- causing a large amount of loaded entities. That being said, make sure to light up all of your caves.\n\n[b][color=white]Mindcrack Allowing Reminiscence[/color][/b]\nWith their release of the Play Mindcrack server, the Mindcrackers themselves have decided to allow players to view the maps of Mindcrack's previous seasons. Not only may it be nostalgic for some of the people that played on the server at the time, but it's too quite nostalgic for the viewers. Players are able to roam the maps in their entirety and furthermore see what some of their favorite YouTubers have done years and years ago.\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nDue to an issue regarding server hosting (more specifically found in [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3974733]this thread[/url]), the world has been reset. As of right now, the only thing that's been affected is, well, everything except /chest, EM balance, and enderchests; that being said, anything built in the previous world is gone. Omniscient had advised to go easy on building as of right now until everything is under control.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]PlayMindcrack[/color][/b]\nComing from the Mindcrackers themselves, a server has finally been made for all of their fans to play on with them. Though it isn't quite like the notorious vanilla server they maintain and broadcast, PlayMindcrack features plenty of  mini-games such as Barnyard Blitz, Dwarves vs Zombies, and Survival Games in addition to the allowance of viewing previous seasons' maps. If any of that sounds interesting to you, check out the server today at us.playmindcrack.com!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j63BgTDclGCgD.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]233 Rescued off the Coast of Sicily[/b][/color]\nThe Italian Navy has rescued people from a boat that was in the rough seas; it turns out the boat was overcrowded with people from various different places, such as Pakistan, Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia, Zambia and Mali. Reports have been said that many different people try to come to Italy looking for a new life, but there are always problems when doing that. Some boats do not have life vests, such as this one, and many people die from rough seas and various other things. Sadly, most people are sent back to where they came from unless they are eligible for asylum, have family somewhere in Italy, or have a job somewhere in Europe.\n\n[color=white][b]Car Bomb Explodes in Beirut[/b][/color]\nA bombing in Beirut happened on Thursday, January 2nd, in the neighborhoods of Hezbollah, Beirut. Shockingly enough, there was a bombing one week before in Beirut as well. There were fewer deaths and injuries due to this bombing than the first. Sadly, four people were killed and 77 were injured during the incident. No suspects have been found yet and no one has taken responsibility for the tragic accident. The explosion was said to be felt by neighborhoods close to Hezbollah. Buildings were destroyed, and car fumes and smoke filled the air. Reports stated that one of the victims killed was Mohamad Chatah, a former Lebanese minister and ambassador to the United States. Let's hope that this doesn't happen for a third time.\n\n[color=white][b]Bangladesh Creates Largest Human Flag[/b][/color]\nLast year Pakistan had set a world record for the world's largest human flag. This year, on December 16th, Bangladesh has taken away the title from Pakistan and is currently the title holder. 27,117 participated in this event which lasted five minutes. (Guinness World Records rules.) Many people celebrated because this is one of the first time that Bangladesh has set a record after gaining independence from Pakistan. The date also celebrates the 42nd anniversary of Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan, proving even more significant for Bangladeshi citizens.\n\n[color=white][b]Crystal Meth Raid[/b][/color]\nMore than 3,000 officers raided a village in Guangdong, China this past week. Another raid which happened earlier had 109 raids in a village bigger than the one that happened in Guangdong. During the raid, dozens were arrested and the cops found three tons of crystal meth. Not only did they find drugs, but they found weapons such as guns, knives, and grenades. Pictures were taken of boxes, bins, and huge rooms filled with the meth stored and ready to sell. Around 77 of the drug factories were shutdown during this raid. If you were to calculate the money the dealers would have earned in US currency, they would have made around $232 million. Since the early 90's there hasn't been too much of the drug game going around in the area. It was a perfect spot to make money and have a business since there was no competition.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jqIAAPcV7GZi2.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Google Acquires Bitspin[/b][/color]\nGoogle recently acquired app company Bitspin, who is well known for their alarm app, Timely. The Bitspin team stated in a news announcement that nothing will happen to Timely, and that they will continue to build new products. The bigger news coming out of this, however, is that their premium  version of the Timely app is now free.\n\n[color=white][b]Evernote CEO Pledges To Focus On Core Features And Fix Bugs[/b][/color]\nEvernote may be on its way back. After a tirade posted by Jason Kincaid was noticed by Evernote's CEO, and has promised to focus more on bug fixes and core features. This comes after finding out that when you get support from Evernote, all your notes are saved in plain text log files, and that could be a problem. The CEO says updates will be rolling out to fix bugs over the next few weeks.\n\n[color=white][b]HTC Posted Second Consecutive Operating Loss[/b][/color]\nHTC just posted an operating loss of $52 million, but ended up securing a small net profit of $10.3 million by selling its remaining shares of Beats. This marks the ninth consecutive quarterly drop in sales, despite their addition of the HTC One Max to their lineup. The company is also dealing with general loss of interest in their phones, as well as sales bans and patent setbacks. This means their next release is crucial.\n\n[color=white][b]Belkin Announces A Remote Controlled Slow Cooker[/b][/color]\nAround this time last year, Belkin had partnered up with Jarden, who happens to be the company behind the Crock-Pot, among other things. At that time, they promised we would see kitche appliances that have Belkin's WeMo automation built it. At CES, Belkin finally delivered and just announced the Crock-Pot WeMo Slow Cooker. This device is controlled with the WeMo app and turn it on and off, adjust the temperature or change the time settings. The device is going to ship this spring for about $100, with products such as a coffee maker, air purifier and space heater to follow later on this year.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbsk2wRCmm4QLJ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Rick Ross suing LMFAO[/b][/color]\nLMFAO is currently being sued for copyright infringement for one of their songs, \"Party Rock Anthem\". Ross states that they stole lyrics off of his song, \"Everday I'm hustlin'\". In the song by LMFAO, they say the following: \"Everyday I’m shufflin'\" which subsequently sounds the same as \"Everyday I'm hustlin'\". According to Mr. Ross, he is the one who gave the word fame. Surprisingly enough, they could win a substantial amount of money if they win this case considering the amount of money LMFAO earned from this track, (around 7.5 million copies sold,) as well as their t-shirts and other clothes from their clothing line. Why this suddenly came up, nobody knows; but it could be a huge downfall for LMFAO.\n\n[color=white][b]Coinye West: New Crytocurreny[/b][/color]\nA new cryptocurrency named after rapper Kanye West will be released sometime around January 11th. New cryptocurrencies have been popping up all throughout HF, such as Dogecoin, Omnicoin and even Catcoin. That being said, HF might be seeing a new type of coin being exchanged by members in our marketplace. It has been stated that the creators (who wish to be anonymous at the time being) of this cryptocurrency are not affiliated with Mr. West at all. When the time comes, the creators hope that he appreciates a coin named after him, possibly name drop it, and be able to use it for purchasing various different items, such as tickets. Who knows. This might become the next big thing.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Sales of 2013 Decreased[/b][/color]\nFor the first time in iTunes history, music sales have decreased. Due to more and more software that allows you to pirate music, as well as competing companies, iTunes dropped their digital track sales by 5.7%. They went from having 1.34 copies (2012) to 1.26 billion (2013) being sold. Their album sales have dropped 0.1% to 117.6 million. 2012's total was 117.7 million. Looking at different genres, many artists made more profit than others, but that is an obvious statement. The top selling track of all time in 2013 was \"Blurred Lines\" by the artist Robin Thicke. There are no current signs on sales dropping as of now. When it came to the stocks and market share, UMG (Universal Music Group) came out on top with 38.9% in albums sold. While there was still a drop in album purchases, iTunes was still on top compared to stores such as Walmart or Best Buy.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNtB69lIS9I[/yt]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbtobAO1a50qPD.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nYa know, that little entrance sentence has been there for a long time. I've never even thought about changing it.\nIt's been there since the first Sir's Second, and I now intend for it to be there until the last.\nAmazing how things can stare you in the face, and leave you so oblivious.",
