For those in the dark, CDN is short for [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network][b]\"Content Delivery Network\"[/b][/url] and exists to serve content to end users such as the members of Hack Forums. The change was announced by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] in the thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4225887][b]CDN Security Added[/b][/url], which also mentions that userscripts might be disrupted or broken due to this. Additionally, those who have referrers disabled in their browsers might experience issues. If images fail to load, Javascript refuses to work correctly, or you are faced with a blank screen without CSS, the new security options are more than likely the reason for the problems.\n\n[color=white][b]25,000 OMC Up For Grabs[/b][/color]\nAfter a few days away from Hack Forums, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has returned in full force with the goal of further integrating Omnicoin, or OMC, into the forum. To kick-start the use and reach of the coin, a contest is being held in which a winner can win up to 10,000 OMC for the best submitted tutorial. Secondary prizes of 5,000 OMC and 1,000 OMC will respectfully be awarded to second runner ups and honorable mentions. Submissions are expected to be new threads with completely original content, including all text and images used. Each member may submit up to five different threads for nomination. On June 1, 2014, the competition thread will be locked at noon PST time and the top ten entries will be added to a poll on which members will be given a week to vote. Entries can be seen and submitted on the competition page: [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4226430][b]25k OMC for Best Tutorials[/b][/url].\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Uquxypc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=969003][color=#EFEFEF][b]Tom‌[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1671547][color=#00AAFF][b]Cyrus\u0013[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][color=#EFEFEF][b]Clark[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation points.\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Member Highlights[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] Seen a member of Hack Forums do something amazing for someone?

It has since slowed to a half Bitcoin in 24 hours, but has marked a significant milestone in Omnicoin's market progression. Even in its lull, Omnicoin's volume is third in all of AllCrypt's markets. In addition, multiple times over the past week, Omnicoin has achieved the \"Burning Up The Charts\" award on AllCrypt's main page, even once achieving top volume amongst all the coins featured on AllCrypt's markets. However, shortly thereafter, AllCrypt was working on scaling up to handle load and accidentally started two daemon processes, leading them to halt trading exchange-wide. This caused the volume of OMC, along with other coins, to dip on there. They, however, had the exchange back up and running in short order. Need OMC or have some to sell? Head on over to [url=https://www.allcrypt.com/market?id=672]AllCrypt[/url] and get that volume back up!\n\n[color=white][b]BTER Push Garners Dozens of Tweets[/b][/color]\nIn a recent push to get Omnicoin added to BTER, a popular altcoin exchange, dozens of people posted tweets to appeal to BTER in hopes of a response, with Omniscient's own tweet gaining 74 Retweets. Even though the push is still going on, it has since been un-stickied from the subforum. No response has been received form BTER at the time of writing. This push followed a push to be added on Cryptsy, which has not received a response to the thread, but is reportedly in the queue to be added to Cryptsy's coin voting platform.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yVoOuuj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4216466][b]AnonWare | The Consciousness - The Darkness Within[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Anonymous[/b][/url] - Another great read by Anonymous, telling about his past on Hack Forums and road to success.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4218511][b][SETUP] 100% Spoonfed || Clean DarkComet download provided || skype support![/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1182380][b]Natsu[/b][/url] - A very easy and clean tutorial on how to set up Dark Comet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4142222][b]What are you currently listening to?[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=398783][b]inxy[/b][/url] - If you're looking for some music or want to share your own, check out this popular thread.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4082334][b]Account Creator Extreme Great Tool[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=284245][b]Members only[/b][/url] - Mass create accounts with this fast and free tool.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4218789][b]Everything you need to know about Cryptography![/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2020298][b]James R.

How did you meet them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url] Quite a few of them I knew before I joined HF, for example, Pro circuit and Chargen , I met these two 2 years before I joined HF I helped Pro circuit who's former name was nitro run Nitrobooter, and supported Chargen when he was starting TrinityStresser. The rest of the members I met because we had something in common or we met in HF's unofficial Skype group and have been friends ever since.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So tell me what do you do outside of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url] Well, family and friends are a big part of my life. Recreationally I love to skateboard, play minecraft with friends, go to the movies, hang out with my girlfriend, and listen to music.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Good to hear, I get an immense amount of support from my family as well. What kind of music are you into?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url] I just have a love for music, it is my passion, from 80's/90's gangsta rap, Jazz,Country,Rock,Alternative,Punk rock, Modern rap. Right now im going through my Eazy-E phase. Currently him and Kendrick Lamar are my favorites.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well I see you have a pretty good taste in music, I'm and Eazy-E fan myself. So you said you skated, how long have you been doing that for? I used to skate myself, but stick to snowboarding now.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url]  Wow I never knew that about you, I've been skating for 4 years now, I've been snowboarding for 4 years as well. The best time of my life, I love snowboarding a lot me and my girlfriend bought go pros so when we go we can record ourselves hitting jumps and rails.. It's a fun time!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So you said earlier that you played a little Minecraft, what servers are you active on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url]  FeaturedBmx tried to show me how to play minecraft on PC I spent my time on HC and met Yoshi and a few nice people there but my laptop only has 2 gbs of RAM so it was always lagging. Other than that I played on Ben and Jerry's server with my girlfriends little brother, but usually when I play it's on ps3 with a few friends.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I feel the struggle, my laptop blows and MC is pretty hard to play on it. So tell me, how did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url]  well originally I came here to get itsfluffy's free host booter which was 3 or 4 years ago.. I came back to the site looking to fire up my own stresser 2/3 years later. So in general I was very interested in booters And stressers, realized the community was filled with knowledge and just stayed and tried to learn as much as possible.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] As a previous booter owner I realize how much competition there is in that market, do you still do booter sales? If not, what do you do on the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url]  Yes I have run several booters here on HF In the past, today I'm helping out craze and helping him build instinctbooter but I hadn't messed with a booter since my former booter went down.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate you overall Hack Forums experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url]  I personally would have to give it a 10. Although you may have a bad experience here and there, there is always 20 better ones to take it's place. I've had an awesome experience getting to know everyone on the forums personally. Definitely a 10 best website I've ever been apart of.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I completely agree, the good times outweigh the bad. If you could change one thing about the site what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url] One thing about the site? I would want to change the rep abuse, and scam report and how we deal with them. I believe it's unfair for an ub3r to be able to scam people just because he payed a a certain amount of money, I would Defineatly ban all proven guilty scam reports.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's all the time we have for this interview, do you have any concluding remarks you'd like to give our audience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1830419][color=white][b]Indecisive.:[/b][/color][/url]  to you and all the other HF news group, thank you for all the hard work you put in to keep us entertained.

I had seen my friend on it a couple times and I asked him about. At one point I was just really bored and decided to sign up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I  noticed you're quite active, so you must be enjoying it to some extent. Are you weird? I ask because of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]this[/b][/url] thread you posted.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] Haha. Oh yeah, that. I guess I might be a little weird, but no more than anyone else. I still question my judgement on posting that to be honest, but making the video response was kind of entertaining for me. I am enjoying it a lot here. I used to lurk 4chan during most of my free time before I signed up here. The HackForums community is much less.....toxic.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Give us time, we'll break you down. Do you have any interest in technology? Or are you here for the kicks?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] A little bit of both I suppose. I used to want to major in Computer Science, but after I took a intro to C++ class I pretty much decided that wasn't happening. I still like messing around with programming a little, but I'm pretty bad at it. I mostly just come here to chill out.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Programming is very tricky to begin with but once you're familiar with the basics is becomes a lot easier. Do you have any idea what you want to major in now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] At the moment I'm planning on majoring in psychology and going into medical school to practice psychiatry. It's definitely taking the path less traveled to medical school, but I'm looking forward to it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good luck with your academic pursuits, that will be quite a journey. Are you looking to become a Psychiatrist?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] Oh yeah, most definately. A lot of people think psychiatry is just dealing with dementia patients and drug addicts who are beyond help, which is why there are so few psychiatrists. I'm hoping I'll be able to help a lot of people and do something I love at the same time. It also helps that it's one of the highest paying careers in medicine.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  We could all use a little professional help here and there. I think there's at least one member on HF who's in Med School right now actually. Do you work now? If so what do you do?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] No, not unless you count professional procrastination as a job. Right now I'm just planning out how I'm going to spend my last summer at home.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] You're moving out after the summer's over? That's exciting.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] Yeah, I'm going to be heading up to Rochester Institute of Technology this August. It doesn't exactly scream \"psychology school\", but I really like the campus. High-school hasn't exactly been my best four years, so this will be a really good change for me, I think.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good for you. When did you graduate and when did you decide to hit up that institution?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] Well, I actually haven't graduated yet. Classes ended earlier this week and the official graduation ceremony is later this month. I applied for R.I.T. last year through their early acceptance program. You have no idea how hard it is to take senior year seriously when you've already been accepted to college.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I didn't take my senior year seriously regardless. If you could give Omni one critique regarding HF, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] Well, for the most part, I think Omni does a pretty good job managing the site. The one thing that's kind of been bothering me lately is the new userbars. They don't really seem to fit in with the rest of site's theme in my opinion. Although, that's a pretty minor thing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Do you miss the old school theme at all? Or are you happy it's been discontinued?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2168684][b]ᎦᏣᏲᏐᏃᏫᎿᎩᎮᎯᏝ:[/b][/url] I can't really say I miss the old school theme that much. I personally used the modern theme even before it was discontinued. I think the old school theme was definitely outdated, but it held some sentimental value to a lot of the veteran users.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I agree. I'd like to thank you for joining us today.

This would end all bulk data collection across the entire goverment, including the NSA. Instead of just collecting as much data as possible, agencies will need to get a court to approve getting data on a certain target. One thing of worthy note is that the author of the bill is the same as the Patriot Act-- one of the most scrutinized and controversial bills which allowed for the blatant invasion of privacy from the NSA. This bill marks a change in the direction the United States is taking. Previously, in the Conservative controlled branches of the Government, we were heading in the opposite direction. The question is whether or not this will impede the safety of Americans. \n\n[color=white][b]Are American's Scared to Search Certain Terms[/b][/color]\nRecent research has shown since the Edward Snowden leaks that American's, as well as people even from other countries, have been weary with their search terms. Knowing the government is potentially watching puts a certain fear in people as they browse the web. While here on Hack Forums that may not be the status quo, there has been a 2.2% drop is search terms which were tracked. These terms, such as, \"Bomb, enriched, warnings, target, and even Denial of Service.\" While the drop may not seem like a lot, in terms of the size of the Internet, it is a major change. Overall, this is a very scary thought; however, hopefully new legislation will change the American outlook. \n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nMany people often think that OSX and Linux are safer solutions. While in general, this is true to a certain extent. The problem is, while many people aren't targeting these machines, as the majority of the world's population uses some form of Windows, there are still people targeting these operating systems. Actually, in recent years malware targeting these operating systems has greatly increased. With people much less suspecting of possible attacks, they can be more inclined to try something. Also, with the steep learning curve of Linux, some users may not fully understand what is happening with their machine, leaving them vulnerable. In addition, there are far less security tools and experts with respect to malware removal in each field. While Apple does offer some support, and there are antiviruses, though they are less used on OSX and Linux than Windows. My advice is to install an antivirus and still exert caution when downloading applications.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\nRestructuring.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]New Species of Metal-eating Plant Discovered[/color][/b]\nScientists from the University of the Philippines have discovered a plant that absorbs lead up to 18,000 ppm without being poisoned. This amount is thousands of times higher than most plants can handle before they become poisoned. Out of the roughly 300,000 plant species, it is estimated that only about 400 have this trait, called nickel hyperaccumulation. These rare plants are important because they can help reduce pollution in soil, water, and even the air in a process called phytoremediation. These types of plants can also be used for phytomining, which is the use of hyperacccumulator plants being grown and then recovering valuable metals in plant shoots from metal-rich sites such as gold or silver.\n\n[color=white][b]Eating More Fruits and Vegetables Found to Cut Stroke Risk[/b][/color]\nAccording to a new research paper from the American Heart Association, eating more fruits and vegetables can cut down the risk of having a stroke. In the 19-year-old study on over 760,000 men and women, it was found that stroke risk decreased by 32% with every 200 grams of fruit consumed each day and 11% with every 200 grams of vegetables consumed each day. Eating more fruits and vegetables has also been found to lower blood pressure and improve microvascular function as well as have positive effects on body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Stroke is the leading cause of death in China with an estimated 1.7 million dying from it in 2010. It is also the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of disability.\n\n[b][color=white]Regenerating Plastic Grows Back After Damage[/color][/b]\nUniversity of Illinois researchers have developed a material that not only heals itself, but regenerates after damage has been done to it. Up until this point, self-repairing materials could only bond tiny, molecular cracks. This new material can regenerate large cracks by regrowing the material. Such self-repair technology could be a huge boom for commercial business. It could be used on a car, so when an accident happens, the car will repair itself minutes after. The material regenerates by using two adjoining, parallel capillaries that are filled with regenerative chemicals that will flow out when damage occurs. The two liquids mix to form a gel that will then fill in cracks and holes where the damage was done. The gel, then, hardens into a strong polymer, restoring the plastic's mechanical strength.\n\n[b][color=white]Researchers Discover the Gene That Enhances Cognitive Abilities[/color][/b]\nScientists from the National Institutes of Health have discovered a gene, KLOTHO, that improved brain skills such as thinking, memory, learning, sex, and whether or not they have a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Increasing the gene level in mice made them much smarter, possibly because of the increased strength in nerve cells in the brain. This new discovery can be a major step in providing treatment for those who suffer from Alzheimer's and other dementias.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]CNN Makes Owners of Google Glass Citizen Journalists[/b][/color]\nSometimes news will happen in front of someone and you can't really get your phone out to record it in time. This changes with Google Glass; if you're wearing the smart glasses and something happens, you can record it and share it with CNN. They announce this new Google Glass addition to its iReport citizen journalism project this past week. To share your captured video and photos with CNN, you need to authorize the news network to send notifications, and link your iReport profile to the device. When all is done, you can then start sharing everything you think is newsworthy.\n\n[color=white][b]OMsignal's New Biometric Shirt Tracks Your Breathing, Sends Reports to Smart Phone[/b][/color]\nThere is no shortage of fitness wearables, but most of these go on your wrist such as the Nike FuelBand. OMsignal is changing all that though with their new fitness shirt. The shirt has sensors that measure a person's heart rate, breathing, and movement. It then sends all the data to their smartphone using Bluetooth and in turn could calculate metrics such as calories burned or workout intensity. The whole thing is powered by a removable data module and it goes for about 30 workouts before it needs to be charged again. Running at about $200, this shirt won't be cheap at all, but as of now, it is only pre-orders. There is no word on when the shirt is going to drop to the public.\n\n[color=white][b]California Bill That Requires A Kill Switch On Phones Passes Second Senate Vote[/b][/color]\nA few weeks ago, the senate in California shot down a bill that requires a remote kill switch in every smartphone. A revised version of the bill surfaced again with just a few things changed in it. This is basically the same bill except it gives the companies more time to implement said kill switch as well as not requiring tablets to have this feature. Apple and Microsoft have switched sides after this new amended version surfaced, going from opposing the bill to being onside with it. While it still is early on in this bill's life, there is a great possibility you will be able to disable your stolen phone from the comfort of your home very soon.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Wants Consumers Help Making Cheaper Solar Power Systems[/b][/color]\nSolar panels are becoming bigger and bigger every year with more people trying to reduce their carbon footprint on this earth. For the most part, the panels themselves have been getting cheaper and a lot more efficient during this time, but the problem remains that the inverters are costing a lot of money to consumers. Google has now issued a challenge of sorts because of this. The project is known as the Little Box Challenge and it is an open competition to build new, cheaper, and more efficient solar power system. Google is going to be giving a total of $1 million to whoever can give the best and cheapest solar power converter.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

This hints that he will be handling all of the lighting for the unannounced and unnamed project. Before joining Blizzard, Precourt worked for Cloud Imperium Games, where he handled the lighting and cinematics for the independent studio and projects such as Disney's Frozen. Earlier this year, Blizzard filed for a trademark for something related to a title called \"Overwatch.\" According to Blizzard's website, there is a career listing for a lead producer on an \"unannounced project\" which could end up being this Overwatch title.\n\n[color=white][b]The Elder Scrolls Online Console Versions Delayed by Six Months[/b][/color]\nAccording to a statement found on the game's FAQ page that has since been removed, the Playstation 4 and Xbox One versions of The Elder Scrolls Online have been delayed by six months. The content reveals: \"While it has become clear that our planned June release of the console versions isn’t going to be possible, we have made great progress, we have concluded that we’ll need about six more months to ensure we deliver the experience our fans expect and deserve.\" The statement also included a link to a blog post which detailed further announcements about the delay, but has since been removed as well. Bethesda also released a statement after the original statement was first found on the FAQ page: \"We continue to work on the console versions of ESO, and game development has been progressing steadily, but we are still working to solve a series of unique problems specific to those platforms. Integrating our systems with each console manufacturer’s networks—which are both different from the PC/Mac system as well as different from each other—has been a challenging process. While it has become clear that our planned June release of the console versions isn’t going to be possible, we have made great progress, we have concluded that we’ll need about six more months to ensure we deliver the experience our fans expect and deserve.\" As an apology to fans of the game, Bethesda made a deal with both Sony and Microsoft to allow owners of the PC version to transfer characters to the console versions with a $20 price tag which includes the console version of the game. With the payment of $20, players will receive the full, digital version of the game for the Playstation 4 or the Xbox One along with a free 30 days of game time.\n\n[color=white][b]Halo Updates for the Week of May 11, 2014[/b][/color]\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Halo Job Listing[/b][/color][/size]\nHalo Wars 2 may have been confirmed earlier this week. According to a job listing found on the Microsoft career website, the company is looking to hire a Senior Games developer. The developer's job description is to \"help build and lead the team for a new AAA title within an established and well-loved strategy game franchise.\" This confirms that Microsoft is looking for someone to lead in the development in a Halo Wars sequel or just another Halo game. Since Microsoft doesn't own many intellectual properties (IPs), it is speculated that it could be for a Halo Wars sequel since it was the company's most recent strategy game.\n\n[color=white][b]Destiny Updates for the Week of May 11, 2014[/b][/color]\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Beta Release Window[/b][/color][/size]\nWe learned this week that the Destiny beta will be released in July. In a report sent to shareholders this week, Activision lists three main franchises (Destiny, Skylanders, Call of Duty) with games releasing this year. The report states that Destiny is being tracked to make a new record in the amount of pre-orders for a new franchise. Below that statement, it also states that there will be a beta in July and that the game will be launched on September 9, 2014 for Xbox and Playstation consoles. Though an exact date was not released for the beta, it is a time frame that they are expecting the beta to be released from an internal standpoint. Some have speculated that the beta will be released on Bungie Day-- 7/7/2014.\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Sound Effects[/b][/color][/size]\nIn a video released by the YouTuber [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/MoreConsole]MoreConsole[/url], we are given the beautiful sound effects of the game which have been released so far.

Inspired by games such as Infiminer and Dungeon Keeper, he created a world where limits don't exist. When Notch released Cave Game and rechristened it [i]Minecraft: Order of the Stone[/i], an era was born. Little did he know that his little Cave Game would eventually span multiple platforms, sell hundreds of millions of copies, and inspire toys, conventions, and even a [url=http://www.cnet.com/news/minecraft-movie-in-the-works-at-warner-bros/]movie[/url].

The developers at Mojang are working on improving the spectator gamemode, in which a player can fly around the world without interacting with anything. For those unfamiliar with spectator mode, it is an upcoming addition similar to the [i]freecam[/i] mod that most modified Minecraft clients feature, as spectators can fly through solid blocks and explore the world. The modest changelog, published by Mojang a few days ago, reads as follows:\n[list]\n[*]World border received a bunch of new options & improvements.\n[*]Spectator mode has a preliminary interface for teleporting to other players.

The explosion was reportedly caused by an electrical fault and the resulting explosion has trapped close to 600 workers. Due to the explosion, a fire also occurred which could of claimed even more lives and rescuers are working hard on freeing and pumping oxygen down to those trapped in case of carbon monoxide poisoning. An investigation will begin shortly on the health and safety procedures of the mine and the mine's owners. Soma Komur Isletmeleri will aid in anyway they can under the claim that \"highest safety measures and constant controls\" are in place. Analysts say that Turkey's safety precautions still lag behind compared to most industrial countries.\n\n[color=white][b]Four Found Dead in US Tennis Star's Home[/b][/color]\nFour bodies have been found dead in the burned home of former professional tennis player, James Blake. His home is located in Florida and the unidentified victims were found by a firefighter who responded to an emergency call of the blaze. Mr. Blake was not at the $1.5m home during the fire and was renting it out during the time of the incident. Blake was one of the top-ranked tennis players in the world in 2006 and eventually retired in 2013 after a 14-year career. Emergency crews battled with the fire throughout Wednesday before extinguishing it. Two bodies were then located earlier in the day, a third later in the morning, and a fourth during the afternoon.\n\n[color=white][b]Investigations into British 'War Crimes'[/b][/color]\nThe International Criminal Court has begun investigations looking into allegations that British troops committed war crimes while stationed in Iraq. British troops reportedly committed war crimes by torturing and abusing hundreds of prisoners and a prosecutor for Hague court has begun a \"preliminary examination\" for allegations of abuse between 2003 and 2008. The ICC said it began looking into the abuse claims when it received a dossier earlier in the year from human rights lawyers. The 250-page dossier detailed reports of beatings, electric shocks, mock executions, and even sexual assault. Those bearing responsibility of the abuses included some of the country's highest-ranked commanders and senior politicians.\n\n[color=white][b]Number of Potential Victims Increases as Hundreds Call FBI about Pedophile Teacher[/b][/color]\nHundreds of people have been calling the FBI about about pedophile teacher, William James Vahey, which has greatly increased the number of potential victims. Investigators say Vahey abused up to 90 boys aged from 12 to 14 during his long teaching career. The 64-year old killed himself in March after evidence was found on a memory drive stolen by his maid. Images of 50 to 60 students were found on the computer drive which led to his arrest. After a appeal for victims to come forward, FBI report it has been \"contacted by several hundred individuals\" who reach out as potential victims or people who wish to provide information in the ongoing investigation.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ndzWS1q.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Disney's Frozen: #1 Yet Again On Billboards Top 200[/b][/color]\nTthe soundtrack made it to #1 yet again on Billboards Top 200. While making history by being one of the few 39 albums to ever have been #1 for 13 consecutive weeks, this movie/soundtrack has brought in about $770 million. As of right now, the soundtrack has sold well-over 2.6 million copies in the United States. This soundtrack has been certified Platinum and I believe that it is not going to be going away anytime soon.\n\n[color=white][b]Chris Brown Spending Another 131 Days in Jail[/b][/color]\nThe rapper, singer, songwriter, and talented composer who's faced a bit of drama these past few years isn't getting a break. Chris Brown admitted to Judge James Brandlin—of the Los Angeles County Superior Court—that he got into a fight with another man. This fight violated his probation that he received from the Chris Brown/Rihanna issue that erupted in 2009. He was originally sentenced to one year in jail for leaving a court-ordered rehab term, but the judge credited him the 234 days he already served. Now the question is: will he stay out of trouble after his time has been served?\n\n[color=white][b]Kurt Cobain: A Never Ending Mystery[/b][/color]\nKurt Cobain, influential artist and lead singer of the grunge band Nirvana, died on April 5, 1994 from a gunshot in a successful suicide attempt. The case, however, has been reopened for investigation as new evidence surfaced. A letter found in Kurt's wallet points to a depression caused by his wife, Courtney Love. The letter reads \"Do you Kurt Cobain take Courtney Michelle Love to be your lawful shredded wife, even when she's a bitch with zits and siphoning all your money for doping and whoring. Will you promise to fuck her at least once a week, O.K.\" Courtney Love's own father states his daughter played a part in Kurt's death. Could Seattle's Police Department have gotten his death all wrong?\n\n[color=white][b]Robert Plant rules out any chance of a Led Zeppelin reunion[/b][/color]\nThe legendary lead vocalist of Led Zeppelin has a blunt view on being apart of the band's reunion. When asked about the reunion, he said this: \"A tour would have been an absolute menagerie of vested interests and the very essence of everything that's shitty about about big-time stadium rock. We were surrounded by a circus of people that would have had our souls on the fire. I'm not part of a jukebox!\" Robert Plant, who's now 66 years-old, has successfully turned down a tour/reunion that could have brought in close to $1 billlion and could have made history by being the only tour to bring in that much revenue. Jimmy Page, guitarist for Led Zeppelin, stated that there is very little chance of a reunion ever taking place and he also released this statement \"There's always a possibility that they can exhume me and put me onstage in a coffin and play a tape.\" Maybe he's jabbing the recent hologram performances and saying it's possible that he will be one also after his passing or is he simply saying he won't be performing in his lifetime with the band. As a fan, I'm upset to see this, but I'm also glad they're not selling out to big companies as advertisement, etc.\n\n[color=white][b]Eminem's Emotional Mothers Day Apology[/b][/color]\nWith his new album [i]MMLP2[/i], Eminem made quite a few emotional songs and a few funny ones. One of his most emotional singles \"Headlights\" now has it's own music video. The song is known to have apologized to his mother, Debbie Mathers, about a couple of things Eminem did in his past to her. The music video to the song non-coincidentally released on Mothers Day which I think is nice despite their history.

He performed a song from his album [i]Good Kid, Maad City[/i] and transitioned into his very own rendition of a song made famous by Tupac called [i]California Love[/i].
