However, you can still access it by going [url=http://hackforums.net/reputation.php?uid=1]here[/url].\n\nOur beloved [url=http://goo.gl/HETYy][color=#0066FF][b]-mothered-[/b][/color][/url] has returned to us, there is still skepticism about it actually being him as his name was changed to Premium(tm) and he is posting in many places he usually wouldn't.\n-He was recently banned for stolen account.\n\nA loyal Reviewer and member who has been banned for the last two months has finally returned, [url=http://goo.gl/OxtbC][color=#0066FF][b]Vanadium[/b][/color][/url] had been banned due to a bug in the system.\n\n[url=http://goo.gl/TFS71][color=white][b]Nyx-[/b][/color][/url]'s reputation has become a battleground, with over fifty-four negatives in just the past week. He is also the user with the second highest negative reputation.\n\n[color=#0066FF][b]Thirty-two[/b][/color] people have joined the deep blue sea as Ub3rs since the last edition.\n\nThere has been well over a hundred bans due to the new \"Not in Marketplace\" rule.\n\n[align=center][img]http://goo.gl/6bjLl[/img][/align]\n\n[color=#FFFFE0][size=large][b]General Thread(s)[/b][/size][/color]\n[i][b]Heart-Warming Thread[/b][/i] - [url=http://goo.gl/45t0S]My thoughts on love, a love story, and some questions.[/url] - [url=http://goo.gl/uqFpZ][color=#0066FF][b]Arruke[/b][/color][/url] - While this thread isn't exactly heart-warming, it really is a good and interesting read. \n[i][b]Most Musical Thread[/b][/i] - [url=http://goo.gl/T2aWk]Hackforum's Ultimate Playlist[/url] - [url=http://goo.gl/TxoJ4][color=#0066FF][b]alabama[/b][/color][/url] - This thread did receive a sticky as it appeals to many tastes and musical preferences.\n[i][b]Funniest Troll[/b][/i] - [url=http://goo.gl/mSz4L]I need some adviceeee[/url] - [url=http://goo.gl/gkIya][color=white][b]Frida[/b][/color][/url] - Once again, it must be said, Frida is one of the best trolls on Hack Forums.

I'd like to give a shout out to Factor8™, Paradoxum, Tha Sneak, Infallible. And anyone else who I may have missed.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] When you joined hackforums did you have any friends and do you currently have any reliable trustworthy friends on hackforums?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] Not at the time. My first mate would have been Dcrac23 from memory as he purchased myself an Upgrade from being a normal member to Ub3r, I'm still quite thankful till this date for that even though he isn't active. Yes at the moment I've got a numerous amount of friends on hackforums added on msn messenger which I speak to on a day to day basis.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] How did you find hackforums?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] I was searching for some runescape related hacking tools I believe a few months prior to deciding to register. I did an ideal amount of lurking after deciding to register, from memory I had around three weeks of overall online with around fifty posts.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] How did you think of your username (T3h Hack3r)?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] I still can't recall how I came across it till this date. I've gone as the name T3h on various gaming forums which some members here may recognise myself by. I wished to change my username around a week back to TH although username had to be above three characters.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] Are you a black hat, white hat, or a gray hat hacker? Or are you not a hacker at all?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] I'd describe myself as a grey hat hacker, being associated with the Hijackthis team I'm not allowed to associate myself with disallowed blackhat activity. Although I do install various forms or malware on my virtual machine from time to time for testing purposes. Most people these days don't understand that malware can be used for testing purposes.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] Are there any specific reasons why you were made staff and what was your expression when you were invited to be staff?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] Not that I'm aware of, I followed site policies and also assisted newcomers to the forum prior to being Invited. In regards to my expression I was quite suprised. I recall coming home from school and spamming Factor8's msn saying that I received an Invite. \n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] Do you think you've helped hackforums since you've become staff?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] I would say so. Being associated with the Hijackthis team I answered around twenty logs per day assisting members within our community with appropriate removal instructions. Due to being Invited as Staff I haven't been as active as I used to be, although I still teach trainees and assist members from time to time.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] Do you see your self as HQ?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] No I don't. 😝\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] I see you're in the HJT Team do you help alot of members with their computer problems?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] Yes till this date I've aided around six-hundred to seven-hundred members in total. I also teach trainees through some of the Easy and Advance Practice logs which are required to become a Qualified Hijackthis member.\n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] Is there anyone specific you'd like to say \"Good Job\" to?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] Infallible. For currently taking the HJT workload. \n\n[b][color=#0066FF]Reported[/color]:[/b] Alright now time to wrap this interview up, is there a tip you'd like to give to everyone on hackforums?\n[b][color=lime]T3h Hack3r[/color]:[/b] Read the help documents.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Jokeview - BV1 - We needed an interview, and I received this >_< - More of a joke[/font][/size][/color][spoiler=]\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n Hello BV1\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n Hey\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n Thanks for participating in the HF News interview for September 28th.\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n No problem.\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n Would you like to give any shoutouts?\n[size=xx-small](5 min later)[/size]\n Ok then, let's move on\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n Haha sorry, was closing stuff down.\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n What are your most recent accomplishments?\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n Had like 80 tabs open.\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n That's a mighty accomplishment.\n How'd you conquer that one?\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n haha\n Well accomplishments... avoiding any major downtime from the cops hitting bshades.com was nice.\n Moved over to a nice, seemingly BP, domain\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n How is the business going?\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n Very good actually, we were actually thinking about throwing a sale after the downtime.\n Giving out some free copies, a lot of discounts, etc.\n Also looking into expanding a bit\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\n Would I be able to join the Blackshades team?\n[b][color=#E0FFFF]BV1 says:[/color][/b]\n If you're interested and willing to fill out an app, I'd be willing to give you a shot, if you meet the requirements.\n Over 16 years old, Own 2+ bshades products, preferably in the US timezone right now, we need people during that time.\n\n[b][color=#FFFFE0]alabama says:[/color][/b]\nOk, I filled out an application\n [quote][color=#5dc43c][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Minecraft IGN:[/size][/font][/color]alabamaHF\n[color=#5dc43c][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Reason you want to join:[/size][/font][/color]I think I could help greatly with the Blackshades Support.\n[color=#5dc43c][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Do you agree to participate in absolutely all projects or post if you cannot:[/size][/font][/color]Yes\n[color=#5dc43c][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Please link us to some of your Minecraft contributions:[/size][/font][/color]\n[color=#5dc43c][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Will you play our server actively:[/size][/font][/color]Yes\n[color=#5dc43c][font=Monotype Corsiva][size=large]Post activity is required.
