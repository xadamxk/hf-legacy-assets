To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://goo.gl/pxojJ]here[/url]. \n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibbtDZ715LhhGY.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Arise, Photography Enthusiasts![/b][/color]\nPhotography professionals and hobbyists unite! After a lengthy suggestion thread on whether or not a photography forum should be added (keep in mind that the same suggestion had been previously denied several times), [url=http://nsfw.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1299574]Omnisicent's[/url] thoughts were changed as he has most likely noticed a large increase in activity around the subject in recent months, and therefore has decided to open a brand new \"Photography 101\" section. What better place to put the new subforum than in the already active Graphics forum? The addition of such a section to the Graphics area will bring a unique learning experience for those PhotoShop professionals who'd like to learn a thing or two about photography, while photographers can learn from the abundant and excellent tutorials present in order to improve their images with post editing. If this topic interests you, be sure to visit the section [url=http://nsfw.hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=293]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]More Theme Changes[/b][/color]\nA new week brings new changes to the \"Modern\" theme here at Hack Forums. This week's changes include modifications to areas such as the background, the user-stars, username color changes, and reputation page color changes. In regards to the continuous updates, the best way to stay on top of the changes would be to follow [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1299574]Omnisicent's[/url] official [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet]Twitter[/url] account or to read one of the many well developed threads on the topic.\n\n[color=white][b]Wub Dub EDM[/b][/color]\nFollowing a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3796777]suggestion[/url] by the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1299574]ғᴇᴀᴛᴜʀᴇ[/url], the Dubstep subforum has been renamed to \"Dubstep and EDM\". For those who are in the dark when it comes to the meaning of \"EDM\", it stands for \"Electronic Dance Music\" and covers all fields of music most only know as Dubstep. This change most likely will not result in an increase of activity in the section, but those who frequent it will now be a part of a larger genre of music not only limited to the \"wub\". Those interested in seeing the title change for themselves or testing out a new sound system may visit the section here: [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=222]Dubstep and EDM[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]The Brotherhood's Spy Squad Closes Its Doors[/b][/color]\nThe Brotherhood user owned group is well known for the activity of the actions of members within its \"Spy Squad\" group. This group, over the past months, has been on the lookout around the forum in order to make sure that the rules of this community are followed. According to its [url=http://nsfw.hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3805280]recruitment thread[/url], the group has caused the loss of over 3000 reputation points belonging to rule breakers such as account sellers or reputation exchangers, as well as multiaccounters. However, an unfortunate turn of events has caused [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1299574]Omnisicent[/url] to close down the group. Being in the middle of the recruitment process, the closure might come as a disappointment to many. Rest assured that the members within the group weren't the only ones who rule breakers should watch out for, so by no means are those members any safer now.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iyobmhGt2yol0.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Repfucks[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1714297][color=white][b]Fеar[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1084200][color=black][b]Hyphers[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=242678][color=black][b]Breakbeat Junkie[/b][/color][/url] was repfucked for encouraging leaking.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Active Bans[size=x-small]*[/size][/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1791844][color=black][b]๖ۣۜUltimo[/b][/color][/url] was banned for reputation abuse.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1084200][color=black][b]Hyphers[/b][/color][/url] was banned for repfuck complaining.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330628][color=black][b]wingb0t[/b][/color][/url] was banned for impersonating admins.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1586225][color=black][b]Difficult™[/b][/color][/url] was banned with the reason \"Sold Account.\"\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=242678][color=black][b]Breakbeat Junkie[/b][/color][/url] was banned for encouraging leaking.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=608523][color=black][b]Sh1eld[/b][/color][/url] was banned for posting a marketplace style thread outside of the marketplace.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=915191][color=black][b]Burgundy[/b][/color][/url] had their account stolen and was banned as a security precaution.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Vacations[/b][/color]\n[list][list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1263952][color=white][b]Daisy[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation ban.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1043862][color=black][b]M1N3RMΛN[/b][/color][/url] took a vacation ban.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url] took a short vacation ban.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1357063][color=black][b]Aeon ‹3[/b][/color][/url] took a very lengthy vacation ban.\n[/list][/list]\n[color=white][b]Closures[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1631015][color=#383838]itzG0D[/color][/url] had their account closed for having multiple accounts.\n[/list]\n[color=white][b]Awards[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=168826][color=#0066FF][b]Tyler777[/b][/color][/url] donated for the Master Donator award and received the Ninja award along with the donation.\n[/list]\n\n[align=right][size=x-small][color=white][b]*[/b][/color] - As of scheduled release date for the HF News edition.[/size][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibtD6mgmzoGVeX.png[/img][/align]\n[b]Group and Crew General Discussions[/b] - [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3803031]Dynasty | Official Group | Information[/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url] - A thread discussing the recent changes of the usergroup Dynasty.\n\n[b]Website and Forum Hacking[/b] - [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3811326]Dynasty | Return Oriented Programming [ROP][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1539015][b]-๖ۣۜDivine-[/b][/url] - A tutorial created for Return Oriented Programming for those who are already out of the beginner side of hacking.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iV2Z5H1KVQP4W.png[/img][/align]\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232]Hobbyist[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Hello, and welcome to this week's edition the the HackForums News. Today we're interviewing Hobbyist. Do you have any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to make a shoutout to Pat \"The Bunny\" Schweenis.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] I'm sure Mr. \"Bunny\" will be happy to see that shoutout. So what brought you to HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] I don't remember, but if I had to guess it would probably be an active graphics section. I really only like sites that aren't graphics related but have very active graphics sections because then I seem very good at what I do.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Smart. Speaking of which, do you have a gallery where other members can view your work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] Not really. Most of my work is kept secret for fear of persecution by various groups, both online and in real life.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Ahh, what a shame. Well let's talk a little bit about Fly By Night. You're obviously a GFX artist. What got you into FBN?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] Well first and foremost applying got me in. However, I think what really sold the current leaders on me was my fantastic work ethic, go-getter attitude, business experience, general talent, and charm.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Definitely the charm. So what do you think of the other artists in the group? Any guys in there that stick out to you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] I enjoy a lot of the veteran members like myself, kyoutu, echoes, poseidon, denyitall, and color burn. Especially color burn he's great. A lot of the newer members I don't really know or I don't want to know. BUT the person that sticks out the most in the group is definitely Flashy. Some days you love flashy, some days you think he's just ok, but most days you just hate the guy. He's still a great man though, he'll go far in this lifetime I can guarantee you that much. How could the person who runs the marijuana lounge not succeed?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Lol. So I noticed you're not upgraded? What's the reason for that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] Never felt the need to do that or for anyone else to do that for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url]  Well I'm looking through your old threads. You're quite the troll.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] I've always been confused by people calling me a troll. I can see how they could confuse an eccentric, highly intelligent millionaire like myself with those scoundrels though. There are many things that seem to be the same or at least similar with these two types of people to outside viewers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] I see. Moving along, what are some changes you'd like to see on the site before the year is over?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] I've been compiling a list of names for the past 8 months or so that I will send to Omniscient when it is complete. These are all people that I believe should be permanently banned from the site. That is the only change I want to see. The list has around 800 names so far. BUT I would like everyone to keep in mind that these are not people who I have a personal vendetta against. This is a completely unbiased list that I have worked hard on. Some names on it may be surprising to some people.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Can't wait to see how Omni responds to that. Out of curiosity, what is your opinion on the HF News? Do you take it serious, or even read it for that matter?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] I don't read it, but I can appreciate hardwork and dedication.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][b][color=#FF69B4]Saturday:[/color][/b][/url] Can't we all? Anyway, thanks for the interview, Hobbyist. Do you have any closing statements?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1258232][color=white][b]Hobbyist:[/b][/color][/url] Property is robbery.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153]Tando[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to this weeks edition of The HF News! Today we'll be interviewing the very wise member Tando! Before we get this show on the road, do you have any shoutout's you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to shout out #Nate, Morchid and.. Positive. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Right on. So, why did you decide to register at Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] My best online friend threatened me by telling me he'd get his hacker friend from \"HackForums\" to hack me. So I joined and wanted to see what it was about. I also wanted to code RATs.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Ah, the classic hack threat. So what made you want to stick around? Did you eventually learn how to code?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] I can code well in Java, yes. I stuck around because posting on Hack Forums was a great time killer, and I enjoy telling odd stories. However I haven't been very active these passed 3 months since my grandmother died, life schedule is busy and the internet isn't too appealing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] I'm so sorry for your loss. I remember seeing your thread about that and PMing you too. I hope you've been feeling better. So when you're not on Hack Forums, what are you doing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] Gym, college, work and drinking alcohol. Mostly socializing and keeping myself busy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] That's good to hear. Are you currently employed? If so where do you work?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] I'm a male stripper at a strip club downtown.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Well I simply have to see you perform sometime. So what areas do you believe Hack Forums can improve on?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] The members are too young + that doesn't mix well with anonymity. Basically just the members, but nothing too serious.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Fair enough, so how do you feel about all of the theme changes that have been taking place recently? Which theme do you currently use?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] Can't comment on that, have no clue what you're talking about. I visit HF once every 2 weeks to see if I got any PMs from old friends lol. :P\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Oh man. Well that's very sad to hear. Do you see yourself becoming more active in the near future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] Only time will tell, but I'll try my best not to be active.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Why would anybody do such a thing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url]  Avoiding the computer as much as possible, getting fit and improving my life is more important than browsing a hacking forum. :s I'll see, you never know. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Educate:[/color][/b][/url] Well for what it's worth we all miss seeing you around. However it's good that you're focusing more on your real life as opposed to avoiding it. I'd like to thank you for taking time out of your day to do this interview with us, do you have any closing statements?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1113153=][color=white][b]Tando:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I'd just like to say I've got 8 gold chains like I'm Sha-Shabba ranks and I love everyone on HF.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Welcome to this weeks edition of the news! Today we're interviewing Sudsy. Have any shoutouts that you'd like to give before we continue?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] Yeah, I do. I'd like to shoutout Sox, Lovol, Cody, Skeetz, Baghead, Werto, and Rage™.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'm sure they'll be pleased to see their name up there. How did you stumble upon HF? Were you referred by friend of yours?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] I was referred by my friend Lovol. My friends and I were members of a gaming forum before we ran across HF. My friend Lovol was a huge member on there and once we grew tired of it, we decided to join HF. We gave it a try, and we ended up loving it. So we stayed.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds similar to my story, too. Which sections do you mainly post in? Gaming?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] I do love the gaming section. Since gaming is a huge hobby of mine I tend to post in the gaming section as much as I can. My posts range from Hackercraft to looking for some friends to play with in Call of Duty.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] HackerCraft actually seems to be booming in popularity recently. Which is awesome! So tell me, what's the story behind your name? [i]Or do you just like baths[/i]? \n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] I do love baths, but that's not the story behind my name. In the 8th grade we were required to read a novel. I don't remember much about the novel but one thing always stuck with me. The protagonist used to do laundry at a laundromat called \"The Sudsy Duds\". I really liked the \"Sudsy\" part, so I took it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Most definitely a unique name to choose. What hobbies do you have outside of the online world? Do you have a career building up for you?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] As for a career I am still undecided. But some hobbies I have are sports. I am currently a junior in high school and I run for our track team. I also play baseball and basketball with friends.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Sounds like you're enjoyin' life. Which is always a good thing. So, do you have any huge projects planned later on in your career on the site? Something unique?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] Currently another member and I are working on a Minecraft server. Both of us have never been in charge of something like this. Since we're both avid players we decided to take our passion for the game and begin our own server.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Are you taking this project on with your bud, Lovol? Might as well do what you love most. That'd be cool if your server is showcased on here on HF when it's ready too. How do you like HackerCraft as it is now? Liking the changes?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] I am beginning. this project with Skeetz. Him and I have been planning this for a while, we have a website and the spawn is a work in progress. I do think Hackercraft's changes were positive. The fact that we all are farming now makes me happy, I love seeing all of my friends farms.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Speaking of farming, congratulations on gettin' your shiny HackerCraft award. Will your server be based off of HC? Or will it be something completely different, like SkyBlock or creative? I haven't seen much of those type of servers in quite a while.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] I do love the Hackercraft award. For the server though, that's still a developing idea. We for sure are going to have a faction server. I believe prison and mini game servers are the most appealing to players at the moment. I do like skyblock though, so hopefully there will be room it.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] If it's a mini-game type of server, then it'd be perfect to have it implemented. Anyways, what's your opinion of the News and the News Team? Anything that you would want us to change, or perfect? We're all ears.\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] I really love the news. My favorite part is always the Hackercraft news. To be honest, I couldn't make the news any better. The great news team is doing a phenomenal job keeping it an interesting read. Besides the Hackercraft news, I really like the comics. They always bring a smile to my face.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I'm glad you're enjoying our work! It was a pleasure interviewing you. Have any final words before I go?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url]:[/b][/color] Thanks for the interview, it was a fun and interesting experience. Also, Cody and Lovol, we're coming for you.[/spoiler]",

However, Microsoft has announced the official headset adapter for existing headsets will not be available until 2014. \"Xbox will release an adapter in early 2014 that allow consumers to connect many brands of wired gaming headsets to the Wireless Controller for gaming and chat audio,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. Before Microsoft made the announcement, Turtle Beach made their own announcement regarding their line of Xbox One headsets. Turtle Beach announced that the XO FOUR and XO SEVEN headsets won't be available until Q1 of 2014. However, buyers of the Xbox One can still use the official Xbox headset bundled with the console at launch. \"Every console at launch does include the Xbox One Chat Headset, and we are working with third-party manufacturers to create new headsets that will take full advantage of the Xbox One technology,\" Microsoft said.\n\n[color=white][b]Game Delays[/b][/color]\nYes, more delays... sadly. Ubisoft recently announced that Watch Dogs and The Crew has been delayed until 2014. Ubisoft said Watch Dogs is expected to be released between April 1 and June 30, 2014. However, The Crew is expected to be released between July 1 and September 30, 2014. \"As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience.\" Watch Dogs was previously scheduled for November 19th and The Crew did not have a proper release date, but was expected in Q1 of 2014. Along with these delays, Sony has announced that Driveclub has been delayed until 2014. \"SCE Worldwide Studios and the team at Evolution Studios have made the difficult decision to delay the release of Driveclub and Driveclub PlayStation Plus Edition until early 2014,\" wrote Sony worldwide studios president Shuhei Yoshida. The game was previously scheduled for November 15th. It is abnormal to see so many game delays just weeks before their scheduled release date... will there be any more?\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox ONE: Dedicated Servers[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft has announced that dedicated servers will be available for all Xbox One Games for free according to  Albert Penello on Twitter. He simply said \"yes\" when a user tweeted him a question. \"With server-based multiplayer gaming, not only can more players play the game (think hundreds of players simultaneously), the gameplay will be much more reliable for the players,\" Microsoft said. \"No more host migration interruptions, suboptimal experiences for the host, home network NAT constraints, or player cheating.\" Gamers will be able to experience lag-free multiplayer matches... as along as your own connection is decent. Gameplay will be much more reliable. \n\n[color=white][b]2K Martin Layoffs[/b][/color]\n2K Martin underwent staff reductions that reduced the majority of the team members. 2K Martin developed Bioshock 2 and The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. \"We can confirm staff reductions at 2K Marin. While these were difficult decisions, we regularly evaluate our development efforts and have decided to reallocate creative resources,\" a 2K representative told Polygon. \"Our goal to create world-class video game titles remains unchanged.\" It is said that a few remaining staff are joining another 2K studio led by former Gears of War and BioShock: Infinite producer Rod Fergusson.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nIntroducing Xbox One's Friends Application.\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktpqoJfTR3g[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Snapshot 13w42b[/b][/color]\nGetting even closer to their much anticipated version (Minecraft 1.7), Mojang teases users with yet another snapshot. In this release, however, the snapshot doesn't quite add anything notable or worthy of mention other than just a few minor bug fixes. That being said, the release of this snapshot just makes Minecraft users even more anxious for 1.7's release. Additionally, mobs of all kinds are still doing the moonwalk, as notably accepted as a bug for the recent snapshots.\n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft 360: Natural Pack[/b][/color]\nAfter the release of the Plastic Pack for the 360 edition of Minecraft, much question has been made of exactly what was to be released next; finally, though, the questions come to an end. After a video (which can be seen below) was posted with a preview of such, it's been considered leaked and spread all over the place in effort to show users of what's coming up. From what's been seen thus far, to conclude, seems very similar to something western or medieval themed. \n\n[spoiler=[u]Natural Pack[/u]][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=775KU8IFk74[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nAfter its first week given its own thread, the Hackercraft News has done quite well.

Recent climate change has expanded the spider's territory east from Devon into highly populated areas such as South Wales, Kent, Essex, and London. The spiders are often confused with their dangerous cousins, the venomous black widow, because of the distinctive markings on their backsides. Anyone who encounters the spiders should know that they are not aggressive unless they feel threatened and should not be treated with panic. Tony Wileman, of the London Wildlife Trust, advises “Nearly all spider bites come from attempting to catch the spider so it is highly recommended that this is not undertaken. However, if you must remove the spider from your home, please capture it using a jar and a stick or pencil and try not [sic] touching the spider with your hands” (via [url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/killer-spiders-on-the-loose--or-not-a-guide-to-the-really-quite-harmless-false-widow-8887040.html][i]The Independent[/i][/url]).\n\n[color=white][b]White House Urges Supreme Court To Not Take NSA Spying Case[/b][/color]\nThe US Justice Department urged the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) to deny the Electronic Privacy Information Center's (EPIC) petition of mandamus this week which would place an immediate cease-and-desist of the National Security Agency's collection of phone call metadata. The government makes three arguments: 1) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines that only the Government or the recipient of a FISA order may appeal the decision, and therefore EPIC has no grounds to make the petition; 2) EPIC's petition had not sufficiently shown that a lower court wouldn't be able to make a sufficient review of the case; and 3) The “clear and indisputable” circumstances needed to justify the writ of mandamus were not demonstrated in the petition. As of this writing SCOTUS has not made a decision on the petition or the government's counter petition.\n\n[color=white][b]Greenwald's New Media Venture Backed By Ebay Co-Founder[/b][/color]\nIn an overwhelming sense of irony, plans made by Glenn Greenwald to begin his own news organization was leaked to media this past week. Greenwald, made a house-hold name due to his processing and reporting on the Edward Snowden revelations described the move as “a once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity that no journalist could possibly decline” (via [url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/exclusive-glenn-greenwald-will-leave-guardian-to-create-new][i]BuzzFeed[/i][/url]). The new venture has substantial backing from eBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar who pledged $250 million to promote “independent journalists with expertise, and a voice and a following” (via [url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/16/pierre-omidyar-ebay-glenn-greenwald][i]The Guardian[/i][/url]). Omidyar noted, however that they were still at the “very early stages of creating a new mass media organization. I don’t yet know how or when it will be rolled out, or what it will look like.” For now, at least, Greenwald will continue to release Snowden revelations through [i]The Guardian[/i].\n\n[color=white][b]United Nations Urges United States To Be Transparent About Drone Program[/b][/color]\nAn interim report was submitted to the UN's General Assembly last Friday described an investigation into various countries' counter-terrorist drone programs and explored the potential of human rights violations. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report criticizes the United States explaining that “the involvement of CIA in lethal counter-terrorism operations in Pakistan and Yemen has created an almost insurmountable obstacle to transparency” and that, despite that United States President Barack Obama declassified involvement in Somali and Yemen operations in 2012, actual operation details were not revealed. The report states “[we do] not accept that considerations of national security justify withholding statistical and basic methodological data of this kind.”\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Ubuntu’s Mobile OS Now Available for Nexus 4 Users[/b][/color]\nAfter the long wait, a stable release of Ubuntu’s mobile OS is now available for Google Nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus owners. This OS is obviously Linux based, and focused heavily on gestures. This gives hope to some users of the OS having an official home soon, but there is no word on that yet. Until then, users with the two supported devices can get all the mobile OS has to offer.\n\n[color=white][b]NVIDIA Reveals GTX 780 Ti[/b][/color]\nNVIDIA had made quite a few announcements last week involving their new devices and innovations, but that's not what many people are buzzing about. This is the newest graphics card that NVIDIA unveiled this past Friday. Not much is known about the new card, other than it is just a step down from their high-end graphics card known as the Titan. NVIDIA has not set a specific release date as of yet, only stating that it would hit shelves this November.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft Working On Remote Desktop App For Windows Phones[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft had recently announced that they would be rolling out their Remote Desktop app for iOS and Android users, which will allow people to connect to their computers or servers through their phones. This announcement left Windows Phone users wondering where their versions were of this app. That is all put to rest now as Microsoft had just announced this past week that the app would be rolled out to Windows Phones as well. There is no set date yet for the release. \n\n[color=white][b]Lenovo Introduces First Android-Powered Convertible Laptop[/b][/color]\nAs many consumers have seen before, Android has been on its share of laptops, but in Lenovo’s case, they take it to a whole new level. They have just announced that they were working on a new laptop, the Lenovo A10. This laptop will be running Android 4.2 and be around 10.1 inches. This new laptop will also be fully convertible, meaning you can use it as a tablet or a laptop without the need of extra accessories. Although information isn't readily available, we know that pricing will vary by region, but will mostly stick to around $340. There has not been a release date set as of yet.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Miley Cyrus Best Female Debut Of The Year[/color][/b]\nEarlier this week, Miley Cyrus' Bangerz topped at #1 on the Billboard albums chart, selling more than 270,000 copies. That number still wasn't enough to beat 2013's biggest sellers such as Justin Timberlake's [i]The 20/20 Experience[/i], Drake's [i]Nothing Was The Same[/i], Jay Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail, etc. — though it did give Miley the best first week of any female artist [i]this[/i] year. Then again, it's not like she's had a ton of competition. As Billboard reports, before Miley's Bangerz's debut, it was Ariana Grande who held the mark for the year's biggest debut for a female artist, selling 138,000 copies of Ours Yours Truly back in September. In fact, aside from \"Cyrus and Grande, only three other female solo artists have debuted with six-figure sales this year: Lorde, whose Pure Heroine sold 129,000 copies in late September, Tamar Braxton, who moved more than 114,000 copies of Love & War on the same week Grande's Yours Truly debuted, and Demi Lovato, who sold more than 110,000 copies of her Demi album back in May.\" Source: MTV\n\n[b][color=white][s]Snoop Dogg[/s] Snoop Lion Now Snoopzilla[/b][/color]\nThat's right, Snoop Dogg, or uh... Snoop Lion has once again changed his name, though this time he changed it to \"Snoopzilla\". For his last album, a reggae one, he changed his name to Snoop Lion to be all deep and Rastafarian, also claiming to be Bob Marley reincarnated. For his newest album, \"7 Days of Funk\" will be released under his new name Snoopzilla, collaborating with producer Dam-Funk. Snoopzilla in a recent interview with Time Magazine stated \"We're babies of the Mothership, I've had funk influences in my music my whole career. Dam-Funk is cold. He's keeping the funk alive and I knew I had to get down with him.\" \n\n[b][color=white]Eminem Set to Perform on SNL November 2[/color][/b]\nEminem is set to perform is widely popular single \"Berzerk\" November second on Saturday Night Live just three days ahead of his The Marshall Mathers LP 2 release, according to rumors. Many anticipate he will perform \"Survival\" or maybe even perform a song fans have not even heard of. Kerry Washington from the ABC hit \"Scandal\" is also expected to guest on SNL. Mark your calenders or set your DVR and all hail your self-proclaimed \"rap god\".

Is it Christmas already? Lorde quickly learned that once you hit #1 in the US, the world is \"basically your oyster\". In a recent interview, she mentioned \"Obviously, lyrics are a huge part of my music, and they're so personal to me, so [...] it'll be such a challenge to step out of my body. I can't wait. Rihanna would be fun to write for because she's done everything. And I'd love to write for — or with — Ellie Goulding, actually.\" And though she still jokingly refers to herself as \"a disgusting person,\" she's definitely looking to clean herself up, and cash in on some of her new-found clout. RiRi has yet to respond, but many are sure she would agree. If you haven't already, make sure to check out Lorde's latest album \"Pure Herione\" out now.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ih4DkNmH5M949.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nReputation. No, not the apples y'all trade on a whim, but the real deal. You've likely heard \"A reputation takes a lifetime to build, and only seconds to destroy.\" I concur. A real reputation takes both continuity and strength. One must follow the same set of principles in all actions and choices, as well as be resolute in one's decisions. One must become and project the being he or she wishes to be, and eventually others will take part from the same perspective. Be who you wish to be, and do not waver from that path. Build the image of your choice, and protect it with a passion. You are only your reputation.",

Not many people \nliked it of course, and eventually he said \"Fuck it.\" I don't think \npeople really appreciated the work went into it. Personally though, \nI love the headers for each menu rather than the gradient in the \nold theme though the main reason I sticked with the old theme is \nbecause of the headers mainly. The header looks bad, even though \nOmniscient said it's temporary so I won't really comment on that. \nAlso the box around the menus at the top doesn't really appeal to \nme either. If the header area was changed, I would personally use \nthat theme. It looks much more modern, though I assume most \npeople have grown with the old theme and are not prepared to \nmove. Eventually, people get used to it and realize it was the right \nchoice. *option to include* Personally with some of Omniscient's \ndecisions I've thought that oh this is just shit and after I realized \nit was the perfect choice, example the new host on HC.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1205532][i]-themadman300[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"The new HF theme, in my opinion, is not good. Not \nat all. The colors clash and everything is hard to read; it literally \nstarted to make my eyes hurt after a while. Although some people \nliked it, I'm glad the theme was reverted back to the original, and I \nguess it's a good thing that members can choose their preference \nnow. I do feel, however, that Omni would be able to craft a much \nbetter theme if he worked collaboratively with the community. For \nexample, Unreputed had a very successful theme which he published \nvia userscript, although it was closed and removed. It was fairly \npopular for a while, and I personally liked it. There are some very \ngood web designers in Fly by Night and various other niches of the \ncommunity, and I bet Omni would be able to create a killer theme \nif he collaborated with them and received their input.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450][i]-Baguette[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"I think it's a great addition to HackForums.

A lot of people are afraid \nof change but I think that sometimes change can be a good thing, \nespecially if you've been using the same old theme for a while. For \nsome reason it made me feel more comfortable while browing HF \nand in some weird way it has also made me more active again. Since \na lot of people didn't like the new theme Omniscient decided to force \nthe old theme on users again and I felt really sad there for a moment \nuntil I discovered that you could simply change it to the Modern Theme \nby changing the theme in your profile options. It's really neat that you \ncan now change the look and feel of HackForums and I'd like to thank \nour administrator for giving us that option because it's a really great \naddition to HackForums.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1204034][i]-DeadLine[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I'm not going to lie, when I first saw the new theme I \nthought it was shit, but my views have changed since then. At first, \nthe theme was very plain, pretty much just the colors grey and purple \nand didn't have any background image and on top of that, the image \nat the top of the page looked poorly made (as of this writing I still don't \nlike the way it looks, I think that bringing back the old image and making \nit match the color scheme would be great). I know that the theme has \nchanged since then and it is still being worked on, but I think the new \nbackground is great and the theme still has great potential, Omni just \nneeds to get a great logo at the top of the page.'\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][i]-Roger Waters[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"What keeps you on Hack Forums?\"\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i.minus.com/iD2yZbLEetACs.png[/IMG]\n[img]http://i.minus.com/i3GEgIzPyvG83.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibvCM1Z22wtoEe.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/a0712d033f0d49830fd90b72335e5c9c/tumblr_mv01zlQ77c1sd2kxeo1_r1_1280.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.bouletcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/20100626.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.toonhole.com/comics/2013-10-21-253_SecondThoughts.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20131021.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.lonniemillsap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/nostradamus-color-1024x1024.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][img]http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Matt/Astronomers,-you-kinky-voyeuristic-geeks.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iOxJ1fCJvvnsB.png[/img][/align]\n\n[size=medium][color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color][/size]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second\n[*]Comics[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656]Mohatu[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/Y2HFq]MarkMare[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227]Lovol[/url]\n[list][*]Minecraft News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=956054]Emylbus[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389]drugs[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list][/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878]Clique[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Educate[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112]Saturday[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editors[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=632426]+Awesome[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=135189]Bad Meets Evil[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451]Yellows[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711]D3xus[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]",
