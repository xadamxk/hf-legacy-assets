During testing, however, a mis-click led to the removal of the Litecoinage award for all members instead of only himself. Luckily, the full list of users who had gained the award remained available because of the award page being loaded in a separate browser window. Constructing a UID list from that page made it possible to return the awards to their owners. The re-addition caused the award to show up as the latest award gained, which members quickly took note of and proceeded to discuss in a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4215615][b]thread[/b][/url] made by the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=398783][color=#EFEFEF][b]inxy[/b][/color][/url]. The award order was later fixed by sorting the order by the time in the postbit. Those who were offline for these few hours will not have noticed any change. \n\n[b][color=white]White Hat Help On Deck[/color][/b]\nThe thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4212521][b]Infected Or Not?[/b][/url], by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1968914]Kaoxic[/url], caused a commotion this week after members in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=110][b]White Hat Help[/b][/url] section confirmed that a member was distributing PlasmaHTTP stubs through giveaways on Hack Forums. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1495835][color=#EFEFEF][b]Aura[/b][/color][/url] lead the investigation with the help of [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=197132][color=#EFEFEF][b]-Hyperion[/b][/color][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1495452][color=#EFEFEF][b]Arrhythmia[/b][/color][/url]. Eventually, it was discovered that the member at fault for the spreading was [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2198289][b]Almighty Sosa™[/b][/url], who had attempted to convince others that his account had been hijacked and used for scamming well over 2,000 Omnicoins. At the end of the day, the offending account was closed and many members saved from having malware on their machines. \n\n[b][color=white]3P1C Feature Discovered[/color][/b]\nWhile details about the benefits of upgrading to an 3p1c account have not yet been announced, Ub3r members may have noticed that their inbox size has doubled with the purchase. A previous limit of 2,500 private messages has been replaced with a generous 5,000, allowing for additional space to store messages online without the need to export them to a local file. What other benefits may arise from the latest usergroup are expected to be detailed by  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] in due time, who has been hard at work implementing a range of new features to Hack Forums. From the 3p1c group to a system to auto-buy donation awards and upgrades, the sheer amount of content being added weekly is sure to excite many members both new and old.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Uquxypc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1229273][color=#00AAFF][b]GeWo[/b][/color][/url] has hit the 10,000 post mark.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1559430][color=#EFEFEF][b]BlueTigerSlayer[/b][/color][/url] has reached the 1,000 reputation mark.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1743726][color=#00AAFF][b]Spyro The Dragon[/b][/color][/url] has reached the 1,000 reputation mark.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1691626][color=#EFEFEF][b]Thrones[/b][/color][/url] was the first 3p1c member with [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1436664][color=#EFEFEF][b]Kiosi[/b][/color][/url] being the second.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451][color=#EFEFEF][b]Farmer Yellows[/b][/color][/url] has reached the 1,000 prestige mark.

Cryptsy may also be a possibility in the future as the Cryptysy Development Team is currently reviewing the coin and situation. While many altcoins are struggling to gain traction in this competitive and saturated market, Omnicoin has found a niche: not for profit mongering, or just being a pointless coin, but a coin that integrates well with our community on a level that no coin has been able to achieve before, especially in such a short time frame.\n\n[b][color=white]The Omnicoin Market Forecast[/color][/b]\nWhile the Omnicoin market hasn't maintained its high of $0.04, it's continuously going strong -- still several magnitudes higher than most \"start-up\" altcoins. As the difficulty falls to a more consistent level, down from the feverish high of 20+, and more reasonably priced rental mining rigs become available, the price will settle down. However, it may not stay this way for long as more and more integration is coming and the demand will likely spark up. Now may be a good time to invest.\n\n[b][color=white]The Pizza Index[/color][/b]\nAs with the (in)famous 10,000 Bitcoin Pizza, there are some things that just become so iconic, so incredible, that it's almost impossible to imagine that it happened. At current prices, that pizza would be over $4,000,000. On May 5th, the member [b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2202225]Running1[/url][/b] purchased a large cheese pizza for 1,700 Omnicoins, giving Omnicoin its own \"Pizza Index\".\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/yVoOuuj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3708597][b]The Brotherhood | xVulnerable | Ask Any RAT Questions | RAT Help Desk | Test Installs[/b][/url] - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1492625][b]xVulnerable[/b][/url] - A great RAT help desk if you're just learning the ropes of ratting.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4205507][b]Twitch views for anybody!

Today we’re here with the HF member Feynman. How are you today Feynman? Do you have any shout-outs you’d like to make? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] I don't really talk to many people in the community now aside from Revolution and Kosmos, so I'll say hi to them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Excellent. I noticed you named yourself after the famous physicist Richard Feynman. Would you mind telling us why you chose Feynman as your HF username?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] Simply put, I'm a physicist, and he's my favourite. I've always loved science, and he really made an impression on me as a kid. Plus, it sparks conversation\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Haha I see. Before we started this interview you mentioned that you were at school, what area of physics are you studying? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] Biophysics. I just started my Masters program last week. I kind of got suckered into it by my supervisor after working in her lab for a the past two semesters. I was initially planning on something a bit more theoretical, as I love the math portion of physics, but I really like what I do, so I think I made the right choice.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Wow, good for you. That sounds like it's going to be an intense program. Most people don't find maths or physics too appealing, What is it about these subjects that appeal to you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] I really like to be challenged. Everything about this field is a puzzle, and every week brings forth a new problem. Figuring out how to solve these puzzles is very rewarding. I especially like biophysics because it's such a broad area. I work with a team of 4 other grad students, each with a background in a different science. It's amazing to see how similar physics, chemistry, and molecular biology really are when you study them at an advanced level.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] In your opinion; can anybody learn the more advanced maths (calc, intermediate calc etc) with enough studying/practice? Or is it something you really have to be cut out for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] I guess with enough time, everybody could learn it to some extent. However, I don't think it's doable for everybody within a reasonable amount of time. A lot of people could learn by repetition, and more or less memorize how to do some problems, but to go far with it requires a firm understanding, which I don't think everybody is able to.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Fair enough. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you were once a moderator for the Education Nation section right? Are you still moderating that section?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] Not currently. I had a bit of a mental health crisis around mid-December of last year, and after discussing it briefly with Omni, I volunteered to step down until further notice.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Ah I see. Well you were very helpful in that section. You even helped me a few times too, thanks again for that. Awhile back I saw a thread that made me laugh out loud. The link can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3502386&highlight=feynman][b]here[/b][/url]. Is it true you regularly study drunk and take test hungover? Haha\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] I'd be lying if I said I was entirely sober right now, if that answers. The internet was down on campus for a few hours around lunch time, so I couldn't get any work done. What better place to go than the campus bar?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Lol. Does liquor help you study? Or do you just like to drink?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] Both. I try not to get obscenely drunk to the point where my memory is impaired unless it's a weekend. I find having two or three drinks helps me tune out background noise that would otherwise be distracting, and the slight buzz makes everything a bit more interesting. It's not something I'd recommend to everybody though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] If you could offer one piece of advice to the HF community, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1371476][b]Feynman:[/b][/url] Balance is the key to being. If you spend too much time at school, and not enough time on yourself, you'll be lifeless and no fun. Conversely, if you don't do anything in school, you'll find yourself under more and more stress as you get older. Find the right balance, and you'll find yourself enjoying life a lot more. I think the \"why\" is pretty self-explanatory.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Thank you for taking time out of your day to interview with us. I hope to see you around HF more in the future.

Today I'm here with the HF member JT. What's up JT? Do you have any shout-out's you'd like to make before we proceed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860481][b]I Am JT:[/b][/url] Hey Clark! Thanks for having me.

I always see your threads in the marketplace. Would you like to tell us what it is you're selling and how you started selling those items?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860481][b]I Am JT:[/b][/url] No Problems, As of right now I only sell an Ebook due to some delays and issues with my old product line. My VPN Service should be launching in a day or so. I started selling things from HF using profit that I actually earned from an Ebook I purchased in 2011. I now own the rights to it interestingly enough.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Wow, awesome. So I take it your primary reason for joining HF was to make money? Or is there more to it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860481][b]I Am JT:[/b][/url] Like a lot of HF Members from 2011, I joined HF in the search for OG Gamertags after hearing quite a bit about it on TheTechGame\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]   Oh, so you're a TTG member.

Jk, so have you found a special GT that you like yet?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860481][b]I Am JT:[/b][/url] Haha I was. I lost interest in the GT/Gaming Scene shortly after joining HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] As most of us do. Do you ave any interest in computers or computer security?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860481][b]I Am JT:[/b][/url] I used to, In High school I studied Computer Sciences & Planned to continue doing so at University but I lost interest so its not really my thing anymore.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] May I ask why you lost interest? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860481][b]I Am JT:[/b][/url] Business & Finances became the apple of my eye and I just lost interest.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I understand.

They're a quite an interesting bunch of people.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting? That's an understatement. Tell me Slash, what do you do outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] Of course its a understatement. Outside of HackFourms, I attend college on a daily manner, which is a time consuming adventure. When I have free time for entertainment, I play on HackerCraft and Skype fellow members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What are you studying? What future plans do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] I am currently studying the route of Computer Science. I am aiming for a future career of being a Software Engineer.  I mosty want to travel around.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] What made you want to go down that career path?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] I have always had an interest in the path of working with computers. Since I was at a young age I always had a passion for using computers, ranging from building systems to studing how the components interact with one another. During my senior year of high school, I was given a project to job search for a future career.  After spending time of finding computer jobs, I settled down with the idea of Software Engineering.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Good to know. I've heard you have an interesting pet, care to tell me the story behind it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] I own a pet snail.  I think of him as my miniture cat who is in love with sticking to my desk.  For about a week and a half, I have taken him under my protection to fend off the Orge's of Narina. Hes a larger snail, with a damaged shell and is one of sleeping for countless time periods.  Most of the people who I blert out \"Where did my snail go?\" aways wonder what I am talking about, thinking that I am on some sort of drug. Nope, I have a snail and its legit.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Comparing a snail to a cat? Whatever floats your boat... So you're pretty active on Hack Forum's mine craft server, how do you feel about the recent changes?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] I feel the recent changes are very nice, I dont have to worry about being griefed and raided as much.  I really enjoy seeing the staff being more active, it brings an inspiration that the server is still being cared for.  I love the recreation of the spawn and its bringings to a new economy.  I heard some of the old features are soon to come, which is pretty nice in my opinion.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] How do you feel about being a l33t member? Do you feel ub3rs get specie; treatment?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] I like being a leet member, but of course the higher the rank the better the treatments.  Members of HF who are Ub3r deserve more abilities because they earned it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] A lot of l33ts I've talked to feel that they've been put down, good to hear you embrace where you are. How did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] I found Hack Fourms back in the summer of 2012 by my friend Noodlez, whom I met while playing Minecraft.   At the end of 2013, I finally made an account and became more active on the fourms.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate you overall Hack Forums experience?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] Well after watching 630, nearly cut off his finger after making a drinking cup for beer, pissing out his window, and nearly drinking 4 beers within a minute. I would have to say my Hackfourms experience is a 9/10, would do again.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I don't want to remember this experience in the morning so I will gladly move onto my 16th beet... If you could change one thing on the forums, what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] Since I am still technically new, I dont know much about the fourms, so there isn't anything I would change about the fourms.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's all the time we have for tonight, do you have any final remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2033659][color=ffffff][b]Slash6992:[/b][/color][/url] Keep classy San Diego.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

Microsoft issued an update on May 1st. This update was for versions 6-11 of Internet Explorer, and even Windows XP will receive it. This does reveal something about Microsoft, though: they've realized that the switch to modern operating systems isn't as successful as it needs to be, with up to 26 percent of people still using Windows XP. Although this vulnerability was patched, there are already more vulnerabilities out that specifically target Internet Explorer 8 that will not be patched. So, for another iteration, if you're using Windows XP: switch operating systems. If your machine can't handle a higher OS, go to Linux.  \n\n[color=white][b]New Protective Legislation in the Works[/b][/color]\nThere is a new plan to reform the way the White House and the United States government treats data. The Senate gave President Obama a report asking for new legislation regarding federal databases and information storage. The report urges new laws in regard to database compromises on a federal level, and laws protecting the data of people under 18. Overall, it is framed to protect not only the American people, but our allies as well. While the bill does speak of the NSA, it does not impose any new restrictions on the NSA's surveillance. The bill is more aimed at the potential problems with federal data being leaked. Podesta, the person who endorsed and worked on the report, said, \"A significant finding of this report is that big data analytics have the potential to eclipse longstanding civil rights protections in how personal information is used in housing, credit, employment, health, education, and the marketplace.\" The new bill also re-promotes a bill that came from Obama before, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. Overall, this is a very large step forward.  \n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nNew exploits come out daily, and many people do not know how to protect themselves. The first step is to find out if you are vulnerable. Read about what application the vulnerability attacks as well as the versions and operating systems that are affected. If you're vulnerable, the next step is to see if there is a patch available. If there is, update and move along. If not, the best bet is to uninstall the application or simply to not use it. Now, depending on the  type of application, you might want to think what sites may use it. If it is a major site you use, you should contact them and let them know of the potential exploit. This can be a crap shoot, but if they do admit to having the software, then it is best to change your e-mail and password there.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rkQmjwM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\nOn its way.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7MFl9lS.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Desert Spider Discovered To Do Aerobics[/color][/b]\nCebrennus rechenbergi is a species of spiders that inhabits the deserts of Morocco that impressed the world with its unique characteristic to do \"acrobatic flips\". Peter Jäger, a taxonomist at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Germany, describes the motion to be gymnast-like and claims that the motion is only used by the spider when it feels threatened because it is costly and would result in the spider's death due to severe exhaustion. Dr. Jäger mistook this species for a similar species that lives in Tunisia, however, determined the type of species through close comparison of sex organs. Five years ago, Dr.Rechenberg was the official discoverer of the Cebrennus rechenbergi. Until now, the astonishing spider was undiscovered to the public.\n\nFor those interested in the spider, video can be found here:\nhttp://nyti.ms/1ia5CBU\n\n[b][color=white]Scientists Create The First Artificial Life Form[/color][/b]\nResearchers in California for the first time create an organism consisting of six letters, instead of four. These letters are known as nucleotides which are molecules that bind together the DNA double helix. These molecules usually contain four letters: A, T, C, and G. Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute added a pair of \"X\" and \"Y\" nucleotides to an E. Coli strain resulting in the bacterium to reproduce normally along with its new DNA. Even though the bacteria reproduces normally, the researchers have to give the bacterium synthetic molecules in order for the bacteria to live. Considering that this could affect more than just the study of biology, it is feared by many that tampering with the building blocks of matter could be too complex for mankind. \n\n[b][color=white]Confirmed Existence Of The 117th Element[/color][/b]\nIt took four years of research for the discovered element 117 to be confirmed an actual element. Element 117(ununseptium) was discovered back in 2010 by American and Russian physicists with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The team at GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research created ununseptium by firing Calcium isotopes at radioactive Berkelium. With the approval of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry(IUPAC) the element can be added to the periodic table. \n\n[b][color=white]Endangered Galapagos Finches Assisted By Scientists[/color][/b]\nScientists seek to help the endangered Darwin's finches battle a parasitic threat. Researches described a method to counter the hazardous larvae of parasitic flies responsible of killing numerous of birds. They placed a pesticide coated cotton balls near bird nests where the birds would pick up bits of the cotton and carry it back to their nests. The pesticide was permethrin which is used commonly to treat head lice. According to Dale Clayton, the parasite is not well-known in the Galapagos Islands hence the reason why the birds have not developed natural defenses against the parasites.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rZ6kQgc.png[/img][/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Google Drive To Lose Document Editing[/b][/color]\nGoogle Drive’s unreleased update was recently sifted through by folks over at Android Police, and they found some interesting information within the update. They have found out that the new version has no document or sheet editing capabilities, and once you try to edit the document, the application asks you to download the correct software to do so. If you do not download the app, you are met with the view-only mode. Now, while people may be upset to lose in-app document editing, this could actually be beneficial for everyone. It seems like Google is trying to make it easier for people to only download what they need. There is no word on when the update will be pushed, but don’t be surprised if/when you lose the editing function.\n\n[color=white][b]Stanford To Use Twitter To Track Earthquakes[/b][/color]\nWhen an earthquake hits an area, it’s very easy to tell. Users of the internet usually take to Twitter when a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hits near them. Stanford noticed this and decided that they would start research on those types of areas and how many users have mentioned a particular earthquake. They started this research using geotagged tweets that could help show where the earthquake happened, as well as what locations might have been effected while the quake was taking place. The team is also using the volume of the tweets to track the intensity and how it has spread. There are currently no immediate plans to use these updates for anything.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft’s Innovation Center To Help Startup Business In Miami[/b][/color]\nMiami is about to get a whole lot more technological if Microsoft has any say about it. The company is looking to open its first US-based MIC, or Microsoft Innovation Center, in Miami later this spring. The Miami-based MIC will reportedly focus on four different audiences. They are: academics, the local Latin American community, start-ups in the area, and lastly, the government. Each group will have its own set of benefits, and they will help the community greatly. As an example, students will have a place to get tech-related job training and pick up the skills they need. It is also reported that Microsoft will also have the CityNext program in Miami, which uses the locals to create \"healthier, safer and more sustainable\" locations to live.\n\n[color=white][b]Ethiad’s A380 To Offer A Hotel-Like Area For Wealthy Passengers[/b][/color]\nWhile there has always been airlines who try to set the bar high for luxury accommodations, Ethiad goes above and beyond with the new A380. The airbus has a suite in it that is aptly named \"The Residence,\" which his a three-room suite. It has a 125 square foot spread between a living room, dining room, bedroom, and a private bathroom. The suite can accommodate either one or two people, with a double bed that can fit you and a partner. The technology on board includes a 32-inch TV in the living area, as well as a 27-inch screen close to the bed; HDMI inputs, USB ports, power outlets, and a Panasonic entertainment system are also luxury perks. The A380 is going to premiere in 2015, and will fly between several locations like Abu Dhabi and London. No prices are available as of yet.\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

It reveals that the game will be made by Sledgehammer Games which will be breaking the on-off cycle between Infinity Ward and Treyarch -- the companies that have made the previous Call of Duty games. The trailer reveals that the game will be released on November 4th, 2014 for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC.

The voice of Master Chief, Steve Downes, was [url=http://www.totalxbox.com/75449/heres-where-master-chiefs-voice-actor-thinks-halo-5-could-take-us/]interviewed[/url] by OXM's Brian Shea and revealed his insights for where the Reclaimer trilogy will take the player next. Possible spoilers can be found in following paragraphs: you have been warned.[list]\"By the time it got to Halo 4, he was struggling with his own mortality and he was certainly struggling with his own emotional mortality,\" Downes explained in an interview with OXM's Brian Shea. \"As things happened in Halo 4, and Cortana began to unravel, that was the only real emotional connection that he had experienced in his adult life. Not to mention what they did in a working relationship. As he saw her begin to unwind and finally began to accept that there was going to be an end to her, I think it was extremely difficult for him to deal with. That was the challenge for me. You're not going to have a scene where Master Chief is going to become completely undone, fall to his knees, and start crying, but yet, there were emotions in him that he didn't really know how to deal with. When you're approaching that kind of a character, you have to figure out how to emote a character that is uncomfortable with emotion. There's nothing I can divulge to you because, quite frankly, I don't know anything! Anything I'm saying here is pure speculation, but I thought that trailer they did was very exciting. I think the popular theory is that maybe he's gone rogue, which would not be out of the question given what he went through. He's holding Cortana's chip, so it would seem as though there is some desire to reactivate that, but again, it's pure speculation on my part. There are so many different possibilities here. You've got to give the credit to the writers for fleshing out a story with that much depth.\"[/list]\n\n[hr]\n\n[color=white][b]Destiny Updates for the Week of May 4, 2014[/b][/color]\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]Next-Gen Game Transfers[/b][/color][/size]\nIn a recent press event, Bungie employee Tyson Green revealed that all Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Destiny players will be able to transfer their characters when they upgrade to an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 console, respectively. \"We're interested in making sure that last gen character can move to next gen,\" he said. \"A lot of people are going to buy Destiny on PS3 or Xbox 360 and then get a PS4 for Christmas. Don't tell me I wasted those last 100 hours there. So we're really interested in supporting that. Our longer-term platform plans, I couldn't speak to right now. But we don't want to lock people in.\" Details on how these transfers would be made were not made available at the time of this report. Green stated that no decision has been made for those who are looking to switch console brands, either from PlayStation to Xbox, or Xbox to PlayStation. This means those who upgrade to a PlayStation 4 from an Xbox 360 might not be able to retrieve their saves on their new console. It is also worth mentioning that transfers like this are often restricted by Microsoft and Sony, the platform owners.\n\n[size=small][color=white][b]E3 2014 Expectations: Playable Demo and Beta Release Date[/b][/color][/size]\nInformation released this week revealed a great amount of what can be expected from Bungie in their E3 presentation as well as what they have in store for the expo floor. This information revealed that there will be a playable demo on the expo floor which will be both competitive and mutliplayer. It is likely that media outlets won't receive much multiplayer information such as PVP modes until footage is seen and they play the demo themselves. The official release date for the Destiny Beta is also expected to be revealed during the presentation as the release date is still scheduled for this summer.

Mojang released a small changelog with a few ambiguous statements. They read as follows:\n[list]\n[*]Pistons now interact with Slime Blocks in cooler ways! (Thanks to ZipKrowd for their contribution!)\n[*]Bug fixes! Many bug fixes!\n[*]The game has achieved sentience.\n[/list]\nYes, Minecraft has indeed achieved sentience.

After the accident she was asked by Police if she had anything to drink that night to which she responded a few sips from a friends drink. Tanya, who is 25, was then taken to jail as the officer explained \"Her eyes were red and glassy looking\" even after she explained to him she was crying after her neck was just broken from the accident. Tanya has a perfect record and because of the severeness of her injury, a field sobriety test was not able to be taken at the scene of the accident.  \n\n[color=white][b]South Korea Train Rams Into Back of Another One: More Than 100 Injured[/b][/color]\nA train rammed into the back of another one in Seoul on Friday leaving 117 people injured. One train was docking while another one drove right into the back of it. Officials have stated that it is most likely due to a sensor failing that notifies the trains where their locations are at, causing the emergency brakes to fail as it got closer and closer. This wasn't a very disastrous moment for South Korea as many of the people injured are only suffering small amounts of pain in their back or knees. \n\n[b][color=white]Robert Ford Takes Leave After Lewd Audio and Alleged New Drug Video Emerge[/color][/b]\nRob Ford, mayor of Toronto, Canada is taking a leave of absence to seek immediate professional help for what he calls a \"problem with alcohol.\" He announced this as another video of him smoking crack cocaine emerged on the internet.

Katy and John separated in late February after an on-and-off-again relationship which started in 2012. Rihanna has been Katy's friend since 2009 and the two can be considered to be \"BFFs.\" Katy Perry is said to be upset with her Rihanna because Rihanna has been spending time with the man who broke Katy's heart. Two weeks ago, Katy found the pair in a recording studio in Los Angeles and was reportedly both shocked and hurt. She's unimpressed to find that her best friend would do something like this. The last thing any girl wants to see is her best friend getting chummy with her ex-boyfriend. It's worse than getting a slap in the face.\n\n[color=white][b]Paramore Turns Ten[/b][/color]\nParamore, an American rock trio, has turned ten years old. In a tweet this past Friday, Hayley Williams, the lead vocalist for Paramore, marked the occasion by stating, \"OK, if memory serves correctly... Our first show was ten years ago today.
