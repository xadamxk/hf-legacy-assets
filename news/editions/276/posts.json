This affects any installation with Linux kernel 3.8 or higher. The vulnerability has been within the code since 2012. That leaves tens of millions of machines vulnerable, 32 and 64-bit. The vulnerability is caused by a Reference Leak in the keyrings facility built into various Linux flavors. The keyring facility encrypts and stores login data, encryption keys, and certificates, and then makes them available to applications. In the end, a reference leak could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel. Perception Point has already reported the vulnerability to the Linux team, and patches should have already rolled out. To patch a system, it's as simple as running the system update command(s).\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2016/01/it-security-firm-trustwave-sued-for.html][b][color=white]Security Firm, Trustwave, Fails to Protect Data[/color][/b][/url]\r\nSecurity firm Trustwave has been sued by their employers for failing to carry out an investigation which led to a breach in Affinity Gaming in 2013. In late 2013, Affinity Gaming saw a massive blow to their security when their payment systems were wrongly penetrated through the use of malware. Trustwave led Affinity Gaming to believe that the breach was \"contained\" until the gaming company asked Ernst & Young for a helping hand with a penetration test. Surprisingly, the testers came across weird activity with a piece of malware, which then led to the company contracting out another company. After FireEye-owned forensic specialist Mandiant finished conducting a further investigation, it was clear that unauthorized access continued to breach the gaming company's security after Trustwave's diagnostics. Trustwave are now having to deal with the gaming company suing them for $100,000.\r\n\r\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2016/01/iOS-Cookie-Theft.html][b][color=white]Hackers Manage to Steal Apple's Cookies[/color][/b][/url]\r\nThe critical flaw in Apple's OS allowed hackers to mimic a user's identity when accessing a website that uses unencrypted authentication cookies. The vulnerability dubbed \"Captive Portal\", allowed hackers not only to impersonate a user when being challenged with a Captive Portal page, but to also fixate a user's session forcing them into another account and not their own. An online security group first discovered the vulnerability in June 2013 and went straight to Apple with it - the vulnerability has only now been patched with the release of iOS 9.2.1. Apple has denied any report being submitted from the security group, whilst also informing the public that this was far from a typical bug. This patch ensures a cookie's storage is isolated when connecting to a captive-enabled network.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ariana.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35388594][b][color=white]Canada shootings: Four killed in Saskatchewan[/color][/b][/url]\r\nPolice say that at Dene High School located in Saskatchewan, Canada, a male suspect who has not been identified to the public yet, had killed four people and injured others in the process of a school shooting. The High School is right next to the town's Community School, where the kindergarten students and kids under grade seven attend. The High School, however, has 900 students enrolled from grades 7 to 12 and is where the shooting occurred. The unknown male is currently being held in custody. Students are safe and were taken to a sheltered area away from the school. The event happened around 1 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 22. The suspect was not apprehended until around 1:47 p.m. at which time a firearm was recovered in the process. A 10th grader by the name of Noel Desjarlais-Thomasin reported hearing 6 shots go off. Hearing screams and shouts telling everyone to run, Desjarlais-Thomas had fled the school frantically  and escaped safely. Investigators are currently working at two locations, one which has been disclosed to the public for safety reasons.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35388842][b][color=white]Zika Virus Triggers Pregnancy Delay Calls[/color][/b][/url]\r\nThe Zika virus has been confirmed to have spread across 14 different Latin American countries, with the most recent being Brazil. The Zika virus has been described as a pandemic in progress; it is a horrible infection in which babies are born with undeveloped brains and abnormally small heads. This disease affects over 25,000 children in the U.S alone. It is believed to have originated in Africa in the '40s. The virus can easily be spread by mosquitoes. It can cause a fever or a rash, sometimes even worse symptoms may occur, but it is most common to receive none at all. Scientists say that there is no known cure at this time and advise those living in Africa, Oceania, Caribbean, and Central/South America areas to use insect repellents and wear long sleeves in prevention of being bit by infected mosquitoes carrying the disease. Some areas in Latin America have declared a state of emergency, informing families that wish to have a baby to hold off and recommend that you delay any pregnancies. Houses all around Latin America are being fumigated to hopefully rid any residences of mosquitoes holding the virus. If you plan on traveling, U.S. authorities have stated that the safest option is to not travel in the countries that have recently announced the virus has been registered in.\r\n\r\n[url=http://news.yahoo.com/u-student-detained-north-korea-over-hotel-incident-073428712.html][b][color=white]North Korea Arrests University of Virginia Student for 'Hostile' Act[/color][/b][/url]\r\nOtto Frederick Warmbier, a college student who attended the University of Virginia was arrested in North Korea for allegedly committing a hostile act towards the country. The college student was attending a New Year's tour of the country, in which those involved were allowed to take pictures and see the daily life of those in North Korea. Warmbier and 10 other tourists were lucky to see inside the isolated country, but it did not end nicely for Warmbier. On the way to board his flight to China, Warmbier was taken into custody by the North Korean government. Everyone but Warmbier was instructed to board the flight back to China. Warmbier was taken into a private room in which he was searched. Charlotte Guttridge, the lady in charge of the tour had told sources that Warmbier was not yelled at and did not hesitate when being asked to go into another room. The KCNA, which is the official news agency of North Korea had created a story of their own where they explained the arrest of the Virginia college student. Supposedly entering the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) as a spy, Korean officials believed that this student was sent by the U.S. government to help stop and bring down the communist country and manipulate the people that live there. The University of Virginia has contacted the family of Warmbier, explaining the event that has been going on. As for information to the public, they wish to keep everything quiet and do not want to share what they know to the media.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

Lightning Farron, the pastel-haired heroine from Final Fantasy 13, found a new calling and it is not saving the world this time. It is in front of the camera. Ghesquière cited video games, and Lightning in particular, as the biggest source of inspiration for his SS16 collection. Lightning captivated both Final Fantasy and Louis Vuitton fans alike by showcasing the very garments that she inspired. After Lightning's successful debut as a model, she sat down with The Telegraph for a brief interview that left Final Fantasy fans abuzz. When asked of her future plans, Lightning responded that she would be back one day soon \"in a world of strife.\" Fans are speculating that Lightning will somehow make a cameo in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake due to the pun referencing Final Fantasy 7's protagonist, Cloud Strife. \n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-starts-a-life-is-strange-anti-bullying/1100-6433834/][b][color=white]Life Is Strange's Anti-Bullying Campaign[/color][/b][/url]\nSquare Enix joined forces with the anti-bullying organization, PACER, to start the #EverydayHeroes campaign. Square Enix used the characters of the critically acclaimed game, Life Is Strange, to illustrate scenarios in which ordinary people can be heroes and encouraged viewers to share their stories of heroism. For every courageous story shared on Twitter with the EverydayHeroes hashtag, Square Enix vowed to make a donation to PACER. The campaign video was viewed nearly 200,000 times and the hashtag was used excessively on Twitter. It is unclear how much Square Enix donated per tweet, but the campaign was considered to have been successful by PACER. \n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq80qyO_qhA&list=PLs1-UdHIwbo4CwHPbdwWJXW2soROp-pR_][b][color=white]Dying Light: The Following Gameplay[/color][/b][/url]\nPopular YouTuber, TheRadBrad, got his hands on the highly anticipated Dying Light expansion a few weeks earlier than its Feb. 9 release date and currently has over 90 minutes of gameplay on his channel. Dying Light: The Following will follow the same protagonist, Kyle Crane, around Harran in his search for a cult of people seemingly immune to the infection plaguing humanity. In addition to the new story line, players now have access to new features like the dune buggy that Crane can use to navigate around majority of the map.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Gladly.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=left]\n[b][url=http://www.space.com/31650-spacex-rocket-landing-jason3-satellite-launch-webcast.html]SpaceX to Launch Rocket for Satellite Delivery, Then Land it[/url][/b]\nSpaceX, a private space flight company, is set to launch their Falcon 9 rocket on a satellite delivery mission for NASA this week.  The satellite onboard the Falcon 9 is known as the Jason-3 satellite, which is designed to monitor the Earth’s ocean, but specifically the ocean floor’s topography. SpaceX’s goal is for the Falcon 9 to take off into orbit, drop off the satellite, and then return to Earth and actually land the rocket, without destroying it. The Falcon 9 will then land on a floating barge in the Pacific Ocean for recovery. The SpaceX rocket has landed again after takeoff before in late December of last year, but the feat has never been accomplished after a delivery. The reasoning behind the landing is to further achieve the goal of reusable rockets to save an incredible amount of money on the cost of space projects.\n[b][url=http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/21/10805420/fender-headphones-in-ear-aurisonics]\nFender Joins the Earphone Market[/url][/b]\nLong known by musicians everywhere for their iconic guitars and gig equipment like amplifiers, musical instruments company Fender is making a step in a completely new direction. After recently acquiring audiophile-grand earphone manufacturer Aurisonics, Fender has announced a line of five in-ear headphone models, stretching from entry-level, all the way to professional grade. According to Any Rowley, a Fender representative, the Aurisonics earphone models were tweaked and improved on after being acquired by Fender. They each use a titanium audio driver, and Fender claims their higher end models fit 95 percent of people \"like an expensive custom-molded monitor.\" The in-ear headphones that Fender will begin selling retail from $99, all the way up to $499.\n\n[b][url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/new-york-to-ban-encrypted-iphone-android-devices-what-you-can-do/]Bill Proposed in New York to Ban Encryption in Smartphones[/url][/b]\nWith smartphone manufacturers like Google and Apple adding more encryption features into their newest devices, a proposed bill has hit the senate floor that aims to ban smartphone encryption, with an “or else” factor to it. In the proposed bill, smartphone makers who do not comply by knowingly selling devices that cannot be decrypted will be fined a massive $2,500 per device sold in New York. Currently, the bill’s progress and full text can be found on the New York’s state[url=http://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/a8093] legislation page[/url], but that’s not all that can be done with the bill on the legislation page - the New York Senate also allows citizens to share their opinion and vote on the bill in an “aye” or “nay” fashion. Although it won’t exactly change the vote, the feature was designed show New York senators how their constituents feel about the bill. The bill’s progress can be tracked on the New York Senate website.\n\n[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Nobility.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Leadership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1469364][color=white][b]Young Prada[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a leader of Titans\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5126569][b][Official] Brotherhood Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5105590][b]Echo | Lounge Recruitment | Join The Squad[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5101704][b]Enigma | Official Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5070037][b][Recruiting] Royalty [Official Group][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5122957][b][SPECIALISTS] General Recruitment - Are you a Specialist? - Open for all[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4932933][b]Titans | Official Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Related Buy-ins & Informational Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5011893][b]Axiom | Official Group | Re-brand Inc | Leader Spot | PP / BTC / WU [$1K][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5126672][b][Official Group] Enigma - Leadership Spot][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097430][b]DARK - Official Group Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097073][b][Official Usergroup]Dawn[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097281][b]Enigma | General Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5127772][b][OFFICIAL] Fusion Official Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5107047][b]Prism | Official Group Information[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4456035][b]Titans | Official Group[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5097188][b]The Black Lodge | How to join | Information[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Sales Threads[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5113214][b][FOR SALE] [Official User Group] Axiom | WU | BTC[/b][/url] [i]Update: Axiom transferred to !Glitch[/i]\n[/list]\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/SiteNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/HashG.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Site Statistics[/b][/color] \n[list][*][sp=[b]Total[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Posts:[/u] 49,546,965 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.22%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Threads:[/u] 3,432,679 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.28%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Members:[/u] 3,016,351 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.19%[/color] )[/list][/sp][/list] [list][*][sp=[b]Average[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Daily Posts:[/u] 13959.19 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.05%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Daily Threads:[/u] 967.11 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.11%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Daily New Members:[/u] 849.82 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.02%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Posts Per Member:[/u] 16.43 ( [color=#32CD32]+0.06%[/color] ) \n[*][u]Replies Per Thread:[/u] 13.43 ( [color=#FF0000]-0.07%[/color] )[/list][/sp][/list] \n[b][color=white]Ban Statistics[/color][/b] \n[list][*][sp=[b]Last Weeks Bans[/b]] \n[list][*][u]Staff Bans:[/u] 140 \n[list][*][i]...
