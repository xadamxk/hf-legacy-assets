[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has recently acquired suggestions from members for the idea of giving away a group for no cost, in [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3734867]this[/url] thread. After tons of replies, this may be possible for the future. Don't get too excited yet, there are a hefty amount of requirements to be eligible. A few of the possibilities to be eligible require having Ub3r, 98% positive rep, 1,000 posts, and you must be in an existing group, plus more. View [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]'s post [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3734867&pid=35028072#pid35028072]here[/url] with all the chat about the possible requirements and more. What do you think about giving away a group when others have paid thousands, post in the thread, we'd love to hear your responses.\n\n[b][color=white]Goodbye Reviewers Group & Section[/color][/b]\nThe [color=#0066FF]Reviewers[/color] group has officially been disbanded. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] mentioned in his tweet, \"It's well past their usefulness.\" before thanking the groups leaders and members. It also seems that the [color=white][b]Officially Reviewed Premium Ebooks[/b][/color] section will be closing alongside the group. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread in the section announcing its closure. It appears that he is giving it some time, as of October 1st, 2013, the section will close.

The poll questions what we use HF for. He claims, \"This helps me analyze the HF community better and make adjustments.\" It seems he is looking for some insight on what most of the members use the forum for. Clearly this is to make the website more pleasurable for specific areas that are excessively used. Make sure to vote on the poll to help [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] out.

[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] recently tweeted, \"Due to technical difficulties Qwazz has been granted 2 more Qwazz Star awards to give out. He's going to be very discriminatory in selection.\" This means that two people have the chance for this new award. We're sure [b][color=white]Qwazz[/color][/b] will be very careful in choosing the holders, since a few of his last ones turned out to scam the community and had their accounts closed. In other news, the group \"Black Diamond\" after its drop in activity and quality, has been sold. The group is now \"Dynasty\" held with the typical description of insightful words and punctuation marks. The groups userbar is shined with a wolf in the middle of a fancy rip of background grey.

Today I'm interviewing one of the admins over at Planet Beacon, Rage! So Rage, any shoutouts before we get started?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]Em, sure. Clique, Genuine, some guy named Xypher, Conception, Sacred, and the people over at Red Lions.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Oh, you know Xypher eh? I hear that guy's kind of a big deal. How'd you come to meet all of these wonderful people, especially that Xypher guy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]I've come to meet that Xypher guy, through a friend named Bay, and on League of Legends, we play quite a bit, and he's a pretty good guy. I met Genuine on the Minecraft server HackerCraft, and we've been good friends since. Conception is the same thing, and Clique I met through the old HF group Beacon.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's fascinating. You've certainly spread yourself out on HF. Now, from what I hear, you're a budding musician. What instrument(s) do you play?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]I currently am playing guitar, and can play bass. I would like to learn how to play drums, and work on other things, such as playing with feel, working on how to play in sync with other people in real life, and maybe join a band or some sort in the future.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's wonderful. I wish I could learn to pick up guitar one of these days. ;-; For you is it just a hobby or do you hope some day to join a band that goes big?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]I was just talking to my friend today about this actually, for me music is a bit more than a hobby, not sure how to explain it though. I wouldn't exactly care if I went big or not, just enjoying myself, and being able to spend time with friends, just sitting down, writing music, and discussing music seems like a good life to me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's pretty cool. Hopefully whatever path you decide to go with music, you're able to achieve it. Now other than music, what do you enjoy spending your time doing? Both online and off.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]Well, online obviously the server beacon, and HF lol. Offline I like to play lacrosse, soccer, and basketball. I like to run.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Everyone on HF seems to be athletic except for me.  I loath all of you. So just to touch base with the Beacon subject real quick, you're an admin there if I remember correctly. What's it like admining such a large server?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]Well, it's just answering a lot of questions, and helping people out. We're at the point where I can still have a nice conversation with someone, and that's pretty nice.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]That's good. I'd hate to be apart of a server and not be able to have any fun because all I'm doing is support. So you're a budidng musician (pretty damn good from what you've played for me ), an admin on a very, very large MC server.. what other goals do you have?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]Well, I'd like to get active on HF again, maybe beat that newb Xypher to 30 on League of Legends, but just overall do a bit better in school, the usual.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Oh, just a moment.. Juuuust a moment, I'm getting a message... what's this? Is Xypher the Cat God contacting me? HE IS! He says not a chance.  Well I wish you luck in your goals. League of Legends seems to be a pretty big thing for you these days. Do you plan on joining Skill or whatever the damn order of symbols that is Vinnie's groups name and become a competitive gamer with all of them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]I'd like to play competivitely with a group of friends, but I don't think I would apply for a group, or at least not yet.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]I best be apart of that group. Now, other than LoL and Minecraft, are there any other games you play frequently?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]Yeah, I like to play CS:GO sometimes, and mess around a bit, but that's about it. I might get into other games soon.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Well if you do, tell me about em! Well, sadly our time is up. It was a pleasure to interview you Rage. Do you have any advice for members reading this?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1183390][color=white][b]Rage™: [/b][/color][/url]Yeah, sure. Remember that Xypher is a big noob, and that you should have a nice day.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=133256][color=#7BFF00][b]Xypher: [/b][/color][/url]Thanks so much for reading viewers!

Before we begin with the questions, do you have any shout outs?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: Thank you. Well, as my group Dynasty is now up, I would like to give a shout out to my group, my two leaders hardcode & ux1q, and also my good friend Anonymous.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: When and why did you join the forums? What made you stay active?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: I joined HF back in 2009. I had known the forum since 2008, as I was playing Habbo and looking for scripts. I later decided that I would register, so that I could view most of the forums to see the scripts and so on. I stopped being active, until about 2011, where I came online and started posting some more. Since 2011, my activity has slowly grown. I have never been the \"big poster\", which is why I do not have a high post count. I used to browse the forums very often, but never really posted or shared my ideas.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Did you expect getting where you are today when you joined?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: No, not really. As I said; I mainly joined because of me searching for Habbo scripts. I became inactive quick. When I \"came back\" in 2011, I did not really expect anything major either. I had met a few new friends, and I was looking more into the marketing-sections of HF. I started to become more interested in RAT's, keyloggers, crypting, and so on. I guess that things just evolved. As I started to purchase more things, look more into the forums, I also had my \"dreams\" of starting my own products. I met my friend Mamba, now known as hardcode, in the middle of 2012. We started talking, playing games, and later decided that we would try to create a VPN. This was my first official product. I am still friends with hardcode, as you can see, and we have had many products since. We now have ux1q on our team, another great guy, and I believe that we will have a great time and also start more products and have fun in our group with the other members.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: What will be your new group based on, if you want to talk about it. Your official thread doesn't say much.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: Indeed, it doesn't. Well, our plans, and as it seems, we want to keep it as a group for friends. We are trying to expand, but slowly, so that we can build up a group of friends, basically. We want everyone to be able to trust each other, which is also why all members have a say on who gets invited and who doesn't. We are trying to avoid intern issues and so on. As far as a topic goes; we do not really have one. Members are free to post about anything they want to, there are no restrictions or topic that they must post about.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: It might take a lot of time. Did you earn the money to purchase it online or did you work hard IRL?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: Hardcode, ux1q and I purchased the group together. We all put in some investments, so that we had the enough amount to pay [M] for the group. My part of the money was solely money that I earned from working online.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: What type of products do you sell on HF? Are they profitable?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: Well, I closed my VPN and DDoS protection a while ago, because of huge issues with Paypal, which meant that we could not pay our servers or receive money. I currently have a stresser, Dynasty Stresser, which is going alright at the moment. I am going to release many more products under my group Dynasty in the future, together with hardcode and ux1q.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have concrete plans for future products? How do you choose what they are going to be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: At the moment, we currently have a few ideas. We are already working on a VPN, which should be released in a few days - if everything goes as planned. We have not discussed the future yet, but as soon as our VPN is up and running, I believe that we will start thinking about new products which we wish to work on.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any forum goals for the future?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: My current goal is to run my group as good as possible. I want it to expand, while remaining as a good group, as a group of friends, and also contribute back to the community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Do you have any IRL hobbies you want to share with us?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: I would not say that I would have any special hobbies, other than hanging out with my friends, playing games, watching TV, earning money online and being on Hackforums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FF9500]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Thanks for taking the time to answer these questions for the HF News! Any final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=42927][b]Lani[/b][/url]: No problem, and also thanks to you for interviewing me. People should join Dynasty IRC and come chat with us![/spoiler]",

Major Nelson posted photos on his blog showing the first boxes ready for shipment to retailers. However, before the console went into full production, Microsoft increased the CPU speed from 1.50GHz to 1.75GHz. \"This will be the biggest launch we've ever done by a wide margin in terms of units shipped at launch,\" Mehdi said. Last month, Microsoft increased the consoles GPU clock speed from 800MHz to 853MHz. As the console is in full production, don't expect to see any more hardware changes. If you missed the release date announcement, the Xbox One will launch on November 22nd in 13 regions. You can buy it for $499 in the US and $599 in Australia.\n\n[color=white][b]ACE Wins Halo 4 Championship[/b][/color]\n$200,000 on the line, one kill. ACE has won $200,000 and the Halo 4 Championship Title after winning the tournament hosted by Xbox and 343 Industries. After fierce battles, it came down to Aaron \"ACE\" Elam and Justin \"iGotUrPistola\" Deese. The championship final match was intense, with both players giving it their best. However, the game ended as a tie. It then came down to a tie-breaker match, but the players only needed one kill to win. Pistola rushed ACE, but was quickly shut down after getting killed by a concussion rifle. ACE said \"This means everything to me,\" Elam said immediately after winning the championship. \"I've been playing Halo since I was nine years old, and I have to say, the games against Deese were the most intense games of Halo in my entire life. I just can't believe this. I feel like I'm dreaming.\" \n\n[align=center][color=white][b]Upcoming Games[/b][/color]\n[b]Sep 10, 2013[/b] - NHL 14\n[b]Sep 17, 2013[/b] - Grand Theft Auto V\n[b]Sep 17, 2013[/b] - Hot Wheels: World's Best Driver\n[b]Sep 24, 2013[/b] - Armored Core: Verdict Day\n[b]Sep 24, 2013[/b] - FIFA 14\n[b]Sep 24, 2013[/b] - PES 2014\n[b]Oct 01, 2013[/b] - NBA 2K14[/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nIGN brings you the world's first hands-on impressions for GTA 5. It does not show any new gameplay, but you'll hear 17 minutes of GTA goodness. \n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krseh1mpRj8[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/iX3LnqNnUtm2v.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Snapshots for 1.7: 13w36a & 13w36b[/color][/b]\nAlongside a few bug fixes, the two aforementioned snapshots prevail some of the newer biomes to come in 1.7: Mesa and Savannah. While the Mesa biome is composed of hardened-clays in order to represent a canyon-type scene, the Savannah biome uses a new display of trees, ponds, and grass (different color). The new biomes are said to come in 1.7, but other than that have had no further word about them. If you're looking forward to a new feel/look of MC, version 1.7 may be for you.\n\n[b][color=white]Chance to Meet the Devs[/color][/b]\nAimed mostly at fans in Tokyo, Mojang developers are ready to meetup. In town for the Tokyo Game Show, Jeb, amongst others, will be attending both the Game Show and Asagaya. Although everyone is encouraged to come and take pictures, eat, and chill with developers, you must be at least 20 years of age to attend Asagaya. They're anticipating good weather too, so if you live in the area, it'd be a cool thing to check out and have a good time.\n\n[b][color=white]Exploit in Spigot to Affect Many[/color][/b]\nDue to a recent exploit in a popular plugin, Spigot, many servers have been suffering from insane amounts of griefing (amongst other things). The exploit had to do with faking a login into another account by sending multiple requests to a server. Luckily, though, one of Mojang's devs, Dinnerbone, quickly noticed the exploit and released a patch in order to prevent it. \n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color][color=white]: Out of Beta![/color][/b]\nAfter its revival/reincarnation into a beta-state, HackerCraft is up and running again at its original IP. Though the server took a world, item, and balance/money reset, players are already back up and running while building bases, XP grinders, farms, and much more. The server is still in an early stage, though, so features such as factions and mcMMO are undergoing slight modifications and tweaks, making things optimal for players. The P0w3r rank has been transferred to all of the previous buyers, new mods have been promoted, and Omniscient has been grateful to everyone helping out, as posted in [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3739633]a thread[/url] in the HackerCraft section.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week: [/color]GodWorld[/b]\nGodWorld is a server that features gamemodes/play-types such as creative, survival, and hardcore. Said servers are accessible by a in-game menu alongside visible players toggle, speed boost, and a server info book. In addition to such, they also have plenty of mini-games (such as paintball, prophunt, and survival games) to play if you're ever in the mood to do so. Check them out at hub.mcgodworld.com!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibx5gFlLxx9bJ1.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]107-Year-Old Man Killed by SWAT Team[/color][/b]\nA 107-year-old Arkansas man was shot and killed by SWAT officers after allegedly provoking a shootout. The Pine Bluff PD got a call about an aggravated assault at a home early on Saturday evening, and when officers arrived, they were told by two people at the residence that Monroe Isadore, 107, had threatened them with a gun. Officers then approached the bedroom they suspected Isadore had retreated to. When the police made their presence known, Isadore shot through the door at them. When supervisors and the SWAT team arrived, they attempted to negotiate with Isadore through the door, but the man would not desist.  The team slipped a camera inside the room and determined that he was armed with handgun. Officers knocked down the door and Isadore shot at them, ignoring a flashbang that officers threw in the room as they entered. SWAT officers then fired back, killing Isadore, police said. \n\n[b][color=white]Sword Wielding Man Halted by Taser[/color][/b]\nA man wielding two samurai swords in a California shopping center was hit with a Taser by police Friday night after he refused to put down the blades. Police arrested Hung Anh Nguyen, 29, after receiving numerous 911 calls about a man swinging two large samurai-style swords in a busy shopping center along Harbor Boulevard near McFadden Avenue about 11:15 p.m., according to a Santa Ana Police Department statement. After refusing commands to put down the sharp 19- and 27-inch swords and yelling profanities, officers used a Taser on the man and brought him and the swords under control, police said. The man, who police only identified as an adult male, was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital for psychological evaluation. No one was injured by the swords, police said.\n\n[b][color=white]Turkish Border Flooded With Syrian Refugees[/color][/b]\nTurks in a southern border town expressed anger over possible United States military strikes against neighboring war-torn Syria.  “This is no good for us, it’s not good for Turkey,” said Nabeel, a jewelry-shop owner, as two of his customers nodded vigorously in agreement. “We will be dragged into this war. We already have been dragged in.” \nAs President Barack Obama trudges closer to authorization for military action against the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad, residents of Turkish border towns worry about how the unrest next door will further upend their lives. Already, Syrian refugees have flooded into their region, creating tensions with locals. More than 2 million refugees have fled Syria into neighboring countries since civil war began there in March 2011, and that number could double -‑ or even triple -‑ by the end of this year.\n\n[b][color=white]2020 Olympics to be Held in Japan[/color][/b]\nThere were scenes of jubilation in Japan early Sunday after Tokyo was named host city of the 2020 Olympic Games. Athletes and officials gathered in Tokyo jumped up and down and hugged after the news, which came at 5:30 a.m local time Sunday. There was an outpouring of pride and joy at the International Olympic Committee announcement – but also surprise among many Japanese who had feared the country’s post-tsunami nuclear crisis had scuppered the city’s bid. Despite reservations about the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant in northeast Japan - and tough competition from rival cities Istanbul and Madrid- Tokyo emerged as the international favorite. Among the strengths of Tokyo’s bid was its status as one of the world’s most sophisticated cities, and a willingness to invest billions in the 2020 event.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/ibnGw6pRzIThtL.png[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Steps to Assure Confidential Data?[/color][/b]\nDue to events that recently occurred and which lead up to the confirmation about data leaks, Google immediately took steps to assure their users and customers that initiative would be taken to further encrypt data. In the wake of PRISM, stated Google, data such as emails and browsing history will be more heavily-encrypted, supplying users with a more reliable state of protection. Though it might be easy for some to breach, it's safe to say that much attention will be paid to the issue.\n\n[b][color=white]Samsung's Galaxy Gear[/color][/b]\nMaking its way into the smart-watch world, Samsung's Galaxy Gear is hitting the market with features that many would find unique. Inside its 1.63-inch display, the device can play music, receive notifications, can connect to any of your Samsung Galaxy mobile devices, utilize plenty of apps and a work well with a built-in camera and a built-in pedometer in which all rely on Bluetooth connection. Though with every set of pros comes an equally-sized set of cons with it; the device, on the downside, has a steep price of $299, has a low battery life, and is quite reliant on its parent device. That being said, it's truly up to the user upon the device's release later this month.\n\n[b][color=white]Amazon's Smartphone-- For Free?[/color][/b]\nAmazon's much anticipated smartphone has had some pretty extensive rumors going around; one of whom involved the device being released for free on their site. Many are questioning this, but a few people have conspired as to why a company would do such a thing. One of the main thoughts going around, though, was that the company would make users buy a carrier plan, charging an annual subscription which would likely be enough to pay for other popular smartphones. Thus, it's said that the company isn't in favor of requiring users to sign an annual contract (or anything similar) to receive the phone, but only time can tell.\n\n[b][color=white]Pleading Guilty-- On Youtube?[/color][/b]\nOn June 22nd, Matthew Cordie, a 22-year-old from Ohio, ran over (and inevitably killed) Vincent Canzani while driving under the influence. Though he stated that had things went down differently (in terms of how he acted), his sentence perhaps would've been decreased and disciplinary actions would've been less-severe. Seemingly though, none of which meant much to him at all, but rather he'd like to get a message across to everyone that drinking and driving is not to be done. Was it a legitimate concern? Was it a pathetic (not the urban, usually bad definition) appeal? Only him and his attorney know. The video can be viewed in the spoiler below.\n\n[spoiler=Video][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MmpK_EshSL4[/video][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/i8dSB5532O5GV.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Katy Perry Release's Music Video for \"Roar\"[/b][/color]\nKaty Perry's new hit officially has a music video to accompany it, featuring the popular singer in a \"jungle adventure\". \"Roar\" has officially hit #1 on the Billboard 100 dethroning Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines,\" which previously had the top spot. Katy Perry was on \"Good Morning America\" recently to promote her album and made a surprise announcement mentioning a \"fan contest\" which you can check out [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVJzdHRNmT4][i]here[/i][/url]. A fun note about the music video: Katy Perry mentioned she was game for about anything, including tarantulas. \n\n[color=white][b]Jay Z Sold His Piece of the Brooklyn Nets[/b][/color]\nJay Z just came off from selling his Nets shares for the second-highest price in NBA history. The Brooklyn Nets are now worth $750 million, 150% higher than what the team was originally bought for. Jason Kidd, now Brooklyn's new coach, has paid Jay Z a whopping $500,000 for only 1% of the team. This only the second-highest price, whereas Vivek Ranadive sold his interest in the Golden State Warriors at a grossed-up value of $800 million so he could purchase the Sacramento Kings. Kidd's investment was a wise choice, according to Forbes Magazine, as the value of NBA teams are skyrocketing. The NBA's broadcasting deals with ESPN/ABC and TNT exceed over $930 million a season. Jay Z had to sell his shares since he wanted to become a sports agent as per NBA rules. He is already representing stars like Kevin Durant and Victor Cruz.\n\n[color=white][b]Ariana Grande Releases Throwback Music Video[/b][/color]\nAriana Grande just released a music video for her new song \"Baby I\". The video features 90's themes and takes the listener down nostalgia lane. She even dresses in 90's fashion such as the once popular overalls, a pair of short shorts and a midriff-baring top resembling Mariah Carey in her 1995 music video for \"Fantasy.\" Ariana Grande also imitated Britney Spears's controversial Rolling Stone cover and showed her \"running man\" moves. \"Baby I\" is her latest single off [i]Yours Truly[/i], which was released released this week. Check out the video [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJuWlMFToNo][i]here[/i][/url] and while you're at it, you can check out [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qMWtIfvzgg][i]Ariana rapping[/i][/url] to Big Sean's \"Guap\".\n\n[color=white][b]Jay Z Kicks Off New Magna Carter Tour while Kanye West Hits The Road With Kendrick Lamar For Yeezus Tour[/b][/color]\nKanye West will be going on his first solo tour since 2008 lasting seven weeks. The tour will kick off on October 19th at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington and end on December 7 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. Tickets will be going on sale on September 13 and expected to be sold out within hours. Check out Kanye's official tweet [url=https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/375965727510888448/photo/1][i]here[/i][/url]. \nJay Z's \"Worldwide Magna Carter\" tour will feature a thirty-four date run and tickets will be on sale on September 12th at 10 AM EST. The tour will feature songs off his recent LP, \"Magna Carta Holy Grail\" which went double platinum. Justin Timberlake is expected to be featured in a few of the events, but there is no word yet on any other tourmates. \n\n[spoiler=Kanye West Tour Dates:]\n10/19 - Seattle, WA @ KeyArena\n10/20 - Vancouver, B.C. @ Pepsi Live at Rogers Arena\n10/22 - San Jose, CA @ SAP Center\n10/23 - Oakland, CA @ Oracle Arena\n10/25 - Las Vegas, NV @ MGM Grand Garden Arena\n10/26 - Los Angeles, CA @ STAPLES Center\n11/1 - Salt Lake City, UT @ EnergySolutions Arena\n11/3 - Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center\n11/5 - Minneapolis, MN @ Target Center\n11/7 - Chicago, IL @ United Center\n11/10 - Detroit, MI @ Palace of Auburn Hills\n11/12 - Toronto, Ont. @ Air Canada Centre\n11/14 - Montreal, Que. @ Bell Centre\n11/16 - Philadelphia, PA @ Wells Fargo Center\n11/17 - Boston, MA @ TD Garden\n11/19 - Brooklyn, NY @ Barclays Cente\n11/21 - Washington, DC @ Verizon Center\n11/23 - New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden\n11/29 - Miami, FL @ American Airlines Arena\n11/30 - Tampa, FL @ Tampa Bay Times Forum\n12/1 - Atlanta, GA @ Philips Arena \n12/6 - Dallas, TX @ American Airlines Center\n12/7 - Houston, TX @ Toyota Center\n[/size][/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler=Jay Z's Tour Dates:][size=x-small]\n» November 30 - St. Paul, MN @ Xcel Energy Center\n» December 1 - Lincoln, NE @ Pinnacle Bank Arena\n» December 2 - Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center\n» December 6 - Anaheim, CA @ Honda Center\n» December 7 - San Diego, CA @ Valley View Casino Center\n» December 9 - Los Angeles, CA @ Staples Center\n» December 10 - Fresno, CA @ Save Mart Center\n» December 11 - San Jose, CA @ SAP Center at San Jose\n» December 13 - Las Vegas, NV @ Mandalay Bay Events Center\n» December 18 - Oklahoma City, OK @ Chesapeake Energy Arena\n» December 19 - Houston, TX @ Toyota Center\n» December 20 - San Antonio, TX @ AT&T Center\n» December 21 - Dallas, TX @ American Airlines Center\n» December 27 - Atlanta, GA @ Philips Arena\n» December 28 - Birmingham, AL @ BJCC Arena\n» January 2 - Ft.

If you're like me, you have some intentions for your future. Although our intentions may differ, there are several baseline similarities. For one, to reach your goal, you must take the first step towards that goal. Often times, you'll feel the need for the right conditions for that first step to be taken, yet I urge you to step anyways--not blindly, but proactively. Sometimes all of the correct conditions will be met, and you'll be free to choose your advance; but, there will be times when your own comfort level will prevent or delay the attainment of your goals. Personally, I have several ideas for my future that can only be met if I take action promptly, as time is running out. Do not get to this point. I have succumbed to many a impediment, namely procrastination and the pursuit of perfection. While I have made the effort to begin my journey, I have not placed my foot firmly forward; I have only been preparing the environment for when that day comes. Don't step down a path unknown, but there is no need for a step-by-step plan. Take that step, and don't take too long. Know the balance, leap with faith, and reach for your goals.",
