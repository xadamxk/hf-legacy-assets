Please jump to either the newly updated [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1863762]HF News Explained[/url] thread or down to Sir's Second for further explanation. For now, the shout-outs will be located under User News, but if the idea becomes popular enough, we may make it a whole section in and of its own. If you've always wanted to be in the HF News but don't want to sacrifice all of your green apples, this is your chance. Thus, we at the Writ3rs hope you'll assist us in expanding the HF News across the forum, entering into new regions of content, and pumping that glorious post count up--especially if you enjoy what we do.\n\n[color=white][b]Query Languages and DBMS[/b][/color]\nAs reported in the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3943255][b]12/23/2013 edition[/b][/url] of the HF News, the members of Hack Forums knew to expect a new section within a few weeks. On 12/20/2013, the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1812197][color=#EFEFEF][b]Kansas[/b][/color][/url] made a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3940220]suggestion thread[/url] asking for the addition of a MySQL section. Within four hours, the suggestion was accepted by site owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] and was implemented earlier this week. The new \"[b]Query Languages and DBMS[/b]\" has been added under the \"[b]Programming, Coding, and Languages[/b]\" tab and has already been filled with six pages of relevant threads. The new addition will surely cause a decline in the amount of posts on the subject in the Website Construction and PHP sections, as well as giving those new to query languages a good place to seek advice if Google is unable to do so. As of this edition, there have yet to be any stickied threads in the new section, so those knowledgeable in the subject and willing to help fellow members should surely spend some time creating quality threads for all to enjoy and learn from. The new section may be visited by surfing to [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=300][b]fid=300[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Spam Filter Adjusted[/b][/color]\nFollowing a suggestion by the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1603444][color=#EFEFEF][b]Mafugsa Bob[/b][/color][/url] (and countless other unanswered suggestion threads), the spam filter has finally been modified. The new modification, carried out by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] earlier this week, has changed the way the spam filter reacts to repeating characters. Before the change, any repeating character would be edited to only have two of the characters when posting the thread or post. As a result, it caused grief to those posting code using [[i]code[/i]] and [[i]php[/i]] tags, as spaces would not remain in place, causing code to look messy. In addition, but much less apparent, url links with repeating characters would not work either (eg. uid=666666 would become uid=66). This change only applies to characters repeating up to six times. Any additional will be changed into only six. The suggestion may be viewed [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3841596][b]here[/b][/url] along with [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3841596&pid=37638543#pid37638543][b]reply[/b][/url] in the thread.\n\n[color=white][b]5,000,000 Lounge Posts[/b][/color]\nThrough the pruning, junking, and other means of reducing spam accross the forum, the Lounge section has achieved a new high: five million posts (5,000,000). Although that amount could have easily been achieved a long time ago, efforts to retain a quality standard have resulted in many posts no longer being counted towards that amount. Usually, forums with five million total posts in all sections are impressive, but leave it to Hack Forums to achieve that amount in a singular section. Currently, site statistics show a total of almost 30 million posts in about 3 million threads in all sections, meaning the Lounge stands atop the popularity list with close to a sixth of all posts. Some may love the Lounge, others cringe at the mere thought of it, but the fact that it's here to stay resounds valliantly through the corridors of the busy castle grounds that the forum rests upon. Those who can't find the Lounge on their own may visit the section by following the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=25][b]direct link[/b][/url].\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jSO3vt1bm2wTp.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1347815][color=#EFEFEF][b]ℓιикℓαи¢є[/b][/color][/url] reached 1,000 reputation points. \n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1320379][color=#00AAFF][b]Squidward[/b][/color][/url] has reached 1,000 reputation points.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][color=#EFEFEF][b]Αnonymous[/b][/color][/url] reached 2,000 reputation points.

I'm joined by one of HF's top posters, Grin. How are you tonight Grin? Do you have any shot outs you'd like to make before we begin the interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] I'm decent tonight. I don't wish to give any shout outs.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I'm going to ask you a very straight forward question, just go ahead and be honest; What do you love about HF so much? You've acquired 34k posts and I see you posting everyday. How have you racked up such a large post count in only a few years?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] There's no reason not to be honest. In any case, I post without realizing that I post and at times, I let my fingers run off. This is how I've acquired the amount of posts I have today and it doesn't phase me at all. I love the HF community and that's honest. At times I like to poke and laugh at it and other times I like to contribute to it. My actions on HF are honest and what I do is inherently a representation of my individuality. I am probably more my own self on HackForums then off HackForums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Out of curiosity, Why aren't you more yourself off of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] Not comfortable with it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I see. A little while ago, you posted a story about your roommate and his crazy ways (see [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3826593]here[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3883420]here[/url]) What ever happened with him? Have you moved away from him? Did the police ever get involved? Was the story true?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] Oh boy. That actually has a conclusion. Before Christmas, I was informed that a new roommate was moving in and I had no information on the Gremlin's living status, but that was fine with me. When I had returned to the dorms from break, I had learned the pleasant news that the Gremlin had moved out. For what reason, it was unknown, but I'm rather content with my new roommate. (Currently only one.) Of course, I didn't enjoy being sexiled, which you may read about in my threads, but it beats living with the Gremlin. The police was involved at one point, but never after. The story was 100% true and no parts were exaggerated unless it was explicitly noted.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahaha that's awesome. What would you say to \"The Gremlin\" if he was reading this right now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] I would tell him to take a fucking shower.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Hahahah. So which sections do you frequently post in and why? Do you have a favourite section?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] I frequent the iOS section to help members with jail breaking and other general issues. I lurk the White Hat Help section as well. I will occasionally find myself in an argument in the SRPP section, which I find entertaining.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] How does the present day SRPP section compare to the SRPP two years ago?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] The same.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Moving on. Since your registration way back in May 2011, what has been the biggest change you've seen HF undergo?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] Probably the change of themes. \nI miss the Marketers and root. Ever since the disband, I haven't had a proper user bar to wear. I say proper because I was proud to represent those groups and wearing the user bars meant a lot more.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Out of all of the user groups you're apart of, which one is your favourite and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] None of them. If you put a gun to my head, I'd say The Brotherhood because it used to be the Marketers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Why are you in them if you're not a fan of any of them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] I don't dislike the groups I'm apart of. I simply don't feel as if they carry enough value for me to pick favorites among them.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] If you could change one thing about Hack Forums what would it be? If you could pick one thing you'd like to remain the same, what would that be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] If I could change one thing, it would honestly be fixing the banner on the Old School theme. I'm trying to be realistic here and what I would like the Old School theme to stay the same.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Fair enough. Well, thanks for joining us Grin. If you have any closing statements you'd like to make before we wrap this up now is the time.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=789677][b]Grin:[/b][/url] Yes. One little request. Someone find my last interview in the HF News. I can't seem to find it. Thanks. :)[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831]Magicmann[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 177th edition of the HF News, Magicmann. Before we get started, is there anyone you would like to give a shout-out to?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you Yuzuha. Yes, I'd like to give a shout-out to Diabolic, as recently (s)he and I have been conversing a lot, and I find him/her/it to be a nice person. As well, I'd like to give a shout-out to the actor, Robert Downey Jr, for being so damned sexy, even though he probably has never even heard of HackForums. Last but not least, to Bandors, who recently has had some trouble with the law, and I wish him the best of luck in getting everything taken care of. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sure Diabolic, Bandors, and even Robert will appreciate your kind words. Can you tell everyone how you came across HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] Sure thing. I was referred to HackForums by my uncle that isn't even active here. I had actually seen it a few times before in different Google searches, but didn't bother sticking around. Once he brought it up, I figured it wouldn't hurt to take a peek, and I ended up deciding to stay.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] That's something you don't hear everyday. I personally think that's cool. Too bad he isn't active anymore. I don't even remember how I came across HF. What do you like to do in your spare time? Code, play video games, do you play any sports? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] It's a bit of everything really. I'm a full-time student, so whenever I'm not working on my studies, I'm pursuing a multitude of other activities. Fortunately, my studies ever-so-slightly coincide with my interest. My graphics class has taught me some usefull stuff around HF, and hopefully I'll continue to get better. I've also been self-teaching myself to code, and actually started just this week. Starting off with C++, as from what I hear it's a fairly easy language to pick up on. I do love myself some video games, however. My favorite as of recent is likely Gran Turismo 6. Got it for my birthday mid-December, and I just can't get enough of the mind-bogglingly realistic graphics. If I'm not sitting in front of the monitor or TV, I'm probably outside bicycling. My father got me into it when I was young, and I've been hooked since. He taught me the basics, and I taught myself to freestyle. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] That's awesome, man. I'm taking a course on HTML and Visual Basics to get a few things down before expanding onto a different language. I, too, like to game as well. Good to know. Since you're interested in coding and graphics would you say those are your favorite forums on HF? If not, what is?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] I'd have to say that I'm most interested in the Groups sub-forums for The Republic and Void. I'm not at liberty to go into detail, but one can find some pretty interesting conversations there, and definitely make new friends. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] I'm glad you're enjoying your time in the group sub-forums, as well as making new friends! I noticed you made a thread about feeding 15 cats! That's outrageous! Can you tell us more about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] \nWell, my family has had cats all my life. My Granny had a cat named Bear (because he was a big, cuddly bear) and my Dad had a cat named Gauchie. Well, Bear passed away and my Granny decided it was time to get another cat. She got a Siamese-Unknown breed mix, whom she named Sweety. A couple of months later, a co-worker of her's brought a box of kittens from her barn to work to give away, and she fell in love with one whom she named Prince William, or Willy for short. Some two years or so later, Gauchie passes away and we're all at a loss-for-words at his death. Our household becomes a lot more quiet than it is normally, and eventually (about two months) later things return to normal. Well, about three years later, a weak looking cat with a bulging belly comes around, and we know she's pregnant. We can't stand to see a pregnant and weak cat just wandering the streets, so we feed her, and give her shelter on our porch within a box. Maybe a week later, she disappears to under the patio of the empty house next door and has a litter of five cats. Over the years, one of her daughters has a litter of it's own, along with other cats showing up. We love animals, and so despite the rising cost, we continue to feed them. To date, we've been actively involved in the care of more than fifty cats. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] I'm sorry for the cats you've lost. That's very kind of you and I'm glad you're taking care of these animals. Do you plan on having your own animal shelter or anything of that nature?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I don't think I would go that far in my younger years. I've got many plans to travel in my future, and an animal shelter would destroy those plans. I do, however, volunteer at local no-kill shelters, and help guide my friends, family, and peers to shelters that will use the adoption money to help improve the lives of animals. I won't go too into detail right now, but I've also got plans to help encourage animal activism online, starting with this large community which is HackForums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] I, myself, love animals too. I would never hurt one in anyway, and I've always helped them as much as I could. Where do you see yourself in the next few years on HF? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] I don't want to seem overconfident or cocky in any way, as I genuinely don't see myself as being better than anyone else, but I see myself as a Mentor, or possibly a higher position than that. In just the four months that I've been a part of this community, I've grown to love it. It's given a lot to me, and in turn, I do everything I can to give back to it. I've had my share of y moments because of my staying active here, (such as being scammed for more than a thousand dollars) but I believe that all it takes is people to guide it in the right direction. There's so many wonderful people here, and I want to help keep them safe from the likes of trolls and other such people that wish to harm HackForum's dedicated members, and help keep new members that one day may turn into HF stars from getting the wrong impression and leaving because of a couple bad apples. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] I've always wanted to be a mentor myself. I wish you good luck on achieving that. Is there anything you would like to be changed on HF? New forum, new groups, anything?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I'd be lying if I said that Ub3rs don't have any use for attachments. Seems like the feature was disabled just before I got my Ub3r upgrade. Google Auth would be nice, I've been waiting on that since I got my Ub3r upgrade. As far as things that can affect more of HackForums, I'd really like to see Omniscient take new usergroups into consideration. Obviously there has to be a strict criteria for approval of them as we don't want any n00b to get one just for the userbar, but in my opinion, there isn't enough variation between the different usergroups. I know that I've had ideas for usergroups that seem like they would be beneficial to HackForums as it currently is, and would help promote future growth. If I've had ideas like that, surely there's people that have been here longer than my four months with better ideas than mine. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] \nThat's interesting. One of my dreams is to be a group leader. Last and final question: what do you think about the rep system? I see a lot of non-ub3r members complaining about the reputation system.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] \nPersonally, I think it's fine the way it is. Even when I was a regular member, I never had any issues with reputation. If Omniscient were to rep-fuck me right now, I couldn't care less. As long as no one lies and says I've scammed them when I haven't, then my reputation is just another number that doesn't actually mean anything to me. Anyone that takes offence over reputation and actually thinks it'll effect them is just silly. Sure, I give out reputation, but it's like a blog. Everything you do, people can comment on. Some people are going to troll, some people are going to be nice, and some people are just there because they like to type useless nonsense. If everyone would stop worrying about their reputation, and start worrying about what the consequences of their actions on the forum are, then they wouldn't have bad reputation to begin with. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131][color=#FFA500][b]Yuzuha:[/b][/color][/url] Well, it's time to wrap up this interview. I thank you for taking the time do this. Any last words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1964831][color=white][b]Magicmann:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. Just three.[/spoiler]",

Project Spark is a game creation suite for Windows 8 and Xbox One and should be available later this year. \"Project Spark Xbox One closed beta begins in February,\" wrote developer Team Dakota on the game's Facebook page. \"If you have a Windows 8 beta key, it will also give you access to the Xbox One beta. If you are in the Windows 8 beta, you will automatically have access to the Xbox One beta when it starts.\" If you have received a key, you'll receive a second one for a friend once the Xbox One beta begins.

The lead designer at Respawn said that six players on each side would be best for the game and that \"The higher the player count, the more uncomfortable the game gets,\" he said. \"Unlike in most games where you can sit there and guard the two ways in, in Titanfall the guy can come in through the window right behind you, he can come from the window to your left, he can come from straight ahead, he can come in from the stairway and he can come in from the doorway, or whatever. Essentially there are five directions you can get killed from and the higher that player count, the more likely you are to get killed from behind and the more difficult it is to kind of manage your surroundings.\" Titanfall launches for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC on March 11.\n\n[color=white][b]League of Legends Adds Email Verification[/b][/color]\nRiot Games has announced that email verification is now required for all account changes. After a player has verified their email address, they will receive a notification any time a change has been made to the account. Riot Games stated that this is the first step to increase security on accounts and also hinted that SMS verification will be coming soon too. You can verify your email address on the League of Legends website in your account details. To say thanks for verifying your email address, Riot is giving players a 4-Win IP boost.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nTurtle Beach shows off their newest creation, a Titanfall headset.\n\n[align=center][video=youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtnH2Nvlr00[/video][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/j5tt3ZeAOMRST.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Avengers Skin Pack Hits 360![/color][/b]\n\"Avengers assemble,\" says Mojang in release of their newest skin pack. Given the comedic introduction, Mojang furthermore continues to introduce their Avengers Skin Pack for Xbox 360. This pack, then, has likely been the biggest one yet including 35 new skins. For a full list, moreover, read the following from Mojang themselves.\n\n[spoiler=Click for a list]\n[list]\n[*]Captain America\n[*]Hulk\n[*]Thor\n[*]Nick Fury\n[*]A-Bomb\n[*]Abomination\n[*]Agent Coulson\n[*]AIM Agent\n[*]Ant-Man\n[*]Arnim Zola\n[*]Black Panther\n[*]Black Widow\n[*]Captain America (Bucky Barnes)\n[*]Falcon\n[*]Giant-Man\n[*]Hawkeye\n[*]Hercules\n[*]Hydra Agent\n[*]Iron Man Mark 1\n[*]Iron Man Mark 7\n[*]Iron Man Mark 16\n[*]Iron Man Mark 41\n[*]Iron Man Mark 42\n[*]Iron Patriot\n[*]Kang\n[*]Leader\n[*]Loki\n[*]Maria Hill\n[*]Moon Knight\n[*]Red Hulk\n[*]Red Skull\n[*]Spider-Woman\n[*]Taskmaster\n[*]Vision\n[*]Wasp\n[/list]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=white]Snapshot 14w02c[/color][/b]\nSeemingly in preparation for Minecraft 1.8, Mojang has released a huge new snapshot with the introduction of new blocks, adventure mode edits, command block edits, and crafting edits. In addition to their mass addition of new features, they've also fixed plenty of bugs. The snapshot, though, still is a little buggy in some aspects-- only provoking the assumption that 1.8 still is a distance away. Rather than me telling you about all of the updates, watch SethBling's video explaining them below in the spoiler for an in-depth evaluation of the snapshot.\n\n[spoiler=SethBling's Snapshot Video][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpWWmDjyk9c[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nAfter a few issues with server properties, a little bit of downtime, and some plugin reevaluation and reconfiguration, the server is finally back up and running.

Overstock.com has recently begun accepting BTC as a payment option. The site has a wide variety of items to choose from: clothing, jewelry, electronics, and more. The BTC community is rising and more and more people are investing in the currency. Even HF has a lot of people who partake in using it. What was the point of the company doing this? Well, they did this because it lowered the fees of purchases. \"Our first purchase with Bitcoin was a $2700 patio set,\" Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock stated. He has even stated that around 150 people had purchased things in the first 90 minutes that the cryptocurrency was accepted. In the first 21 hours the company made $127,000. How will items be returned? Well, there's a simple solution, Byrne says. You won't get your Bitcoins back or USD when you return the item, but you will get in-store credit. Eventually you'll be able to get your money back instead of credit for the store.\n\n[color=white][b]Teen Hero[/b][/color]\nAitzaz Hassan has shown some courage and bravery this past week when he tried to stop a suicide bomber from blowing up his school in Pakistan. Over a hundred students and faculty members were inside the school the time of this tragic incident. Aitzaz wanted to try and stop the suicide bomber as fast as he could. Before you know it, the bomber detonated the explosives and both Aitzaz and the bomber were dead. The people in his area have been calling him a hero and have been commenting about him all day. The people in his area are hoping that the government will grant him an award for his actions. Even on social media sites, he is getting recognition. If you'd like to check out all the people thanking him, or you, yourself, would like to tweet out to the hashtag, you can do so here: #onemillionaitzaz and #AitzazBraveheart. A former Pakistani ambassador has even tweeted out: \"Hangu's shaheed Aitzaz Hasan is #Pakistan's pride. Give him a medal at least. Another young one with heartstopping [sic] courage #AitzazBraveheart.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Ariel Sharon dead at 85[/b][/color]\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister has passed away at the age of 85. He passed away Saturday, January 11th after being in a coma for eight years. The Israeli statesman was a hero to many; he had great leadership skills, and did his best throughout all the Israeli wars. He was in a state where he could only communicate minimally with non-verbal actions. Everything that he did in the past was brought back into the memories of the people and the strength he showed truly inspired people. Ariel was a major figure in events that went on in the Middle East. He was a fearless leader who took no crap from anyone, and got things done. Some actions were for the better good. He sent out troops to stop suicide bombers, raids to stop any terrorists, and had many turning points throughout various wars. \n\n[color=white][b]Venezuelan Beauty Queen Murdered[/b][/color]\nMonica Spear, 29, was recently murdered last week. Spear was gunned down when she was driving with her ex-husband and their five year old daughter. Their car had broken down and armed robbers took fire at them killing Spear and her ex-husband. The daughter survived, though, but was shot in the leg. Spear was Miss Venezuela in 2004. After winning, this opened up opportunities for her to be apart of different shows on various television networks. The loss of Monica has spread throughout the South American nations. The president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, classified this as a massacre. Currently, on the United Nations most violent list, Venezuela is among the top ranking countries. \"One person is killed roughly every 21 minutes in Venezuela. And there were 24,700 violent deaths last year in the oil-rich country of roughly 30 million people, according to the nonprofit Venezuelan Violence Observatory.\"\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jqIAAPcV7GZi2.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Razer's Project Christine[/b][/color]\nA new interesting project from Razer called Project Christine will be a computer separated in parts to make it easy for costumers to swap out parts, so they can always be up to date with hardware. The modular build will be have the individual modules being water cooled and is highly based on the concept of high performance that can easily be upgraded. Even though the project is not out for sale yet the a small public group seems to be frightened of the idea of being limited to one hardware supplier. The project can be seen at http://www.razerzone.com/christine\n\n[color=white][b]The First Steam Machines[/b][/color]\nAt CES Valve could present the first 13 manufacturers of the Steam Machine. Not only were the manufacturers presented but also price and design from most of the manufacturers were also presented. The manufacturers goes from Alien Ware to Origin, and the current listed price range starts at 500$ and goes up to 6000$. This reveal has caused room for a lot of debate among skeptics seeing as the Steam Machine is not going to be competing price with the average idea of a console, but rather seems to start at the price range of a low end gaming PC. \n\n[color=white][b]China Lifts Console Ban[/b][/color]\nAlthough the lift is only temporary China has lifted the ban on consoles which prohibited sale of foreign consoles. However knowing the Chinese there is a catch. The consoles may only be imported and sold to China if they are manufactured in the free trade zone of Shanghai. This of course means that the lift of the ban is only a minor change seeing as manufacturers will have to make them in Shanghai. Previously console buyers would go to a gray market to gain a console.  \n\n[color=white][b]CES 14[/b][/color]\nAll the tech your heart could ever desire was presented at CES 14. Because it would take ages to cover it all, you should go to the website and check out some of the cool stuff that was presented on your own, you will be amazed. http://www.cnet.com/\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbsk2wRCmm4QLJ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Red Hot Chili Peppers To Perform At Super Bowl[/color][/b]\nRed Hot Chili Peppers are set to perform at Super Bowl XLVIII; joining them is Bruno Mars. The Super Bowl is this upcoming February 2 and will be hosted in the very, [i]very[/i], [b][i]very[/i][/b] cold New Jersey (in case you didn't get it the first time, it's really cold.) It's the first time the game will be held outdoors in a cold weather environment. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are currently touring on [b]I'm With You[/b], their 10th studio album.

Believe it or not, the two are still independent and staying true. In [i]The Source's[/i] Man of the Year Edition, Maklemore stated \"I think that it's people that are stuck in a certain mentality, that aren't willing to grow and evolve with hip-hop music, that doubt,\" he said of some in the community who have dismissed the duo's success with The Heist and questioned their cred. \"The first place that some of the criticism will go is the white boy came in and f---ed up hip-hop. But if you take the race thing out, the success at pop, the varying degrees of parents letting their kids listen to it, you cannot deny the quality of the music.\" \n\n[b][color=white]Bieber's neighbor has footage allegedly showing Bieber tossing eggs at his house.[/color][/b]\nNow that he's \"retired\" he now has time to egg his neighbor's homes. On Thursday, January 9th, L.A. County Sheriffs were called out to a gated community in Calabasas, after Bieber's next-door neighbor claimed that the singer had trespassed on his property and was pelting his house with eggs. Responding officers took an incident report, no charges were filed, and it was unclear if they spoke to Bieber at any point. In the footage, the neighbor can be heard yelling \"I see you. I fucking see you!\" at an unknown assailant. Another voice — allegedly Bieber's — shouts back \"Fuck you! I got another one for you, actually!\" They continue to trade words for about 30 seconds, until the neighbor tells his 13-year-old daughter to call the police. Click [url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/09/justin-bieber-neighbor-egging-house-sheriff-deputies/]here[/url] to watch the video. According to TMZ, Bieber is now the suspect in a vandalism investigation, though as of press time, charges have yet to be filed against him.
