Any shout outs before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: Nope, I hate everyone, especially Para, TH, Delly, Shinky, and the rest of the TA Cats.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: A bird just hit my window. I'll be right back...

How did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: I actually got infected. Quite ironic considering where I am now, but I heard from somewhere that the guy who infected me is likely from Hack Forums. I eventually seeked out HF to see what it was about.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Did you ever find out who infected you? Who helped you remove your virus?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: I never found the person. Though, during the time I was on another forum, and one of their Staff members was helping me. He didn't really know too much about the field and he didn't really do anything but get a MBAM scan. It worked, but yet I was still very ignorant at the time.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: When you joined, what made you stay? What did you like about HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: Actually, after the first few months I ended up more or leaving Hack Forums. I was still caught up in another scene. I would venture back here every once in a while, until I signed up on Support Forums. That's where my adventure really began. Paradoxum gave me a chance in a lifetime there, and it actually changed my life. I know it sounds dramatic, but it is true.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: When did you start to work with the HJT Crew? How many people have you helped so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: Well, I started training on Support Forums, under the sole teaching of Para, who I as well as Brandenx781 and Deltron knew as Quintus. Eventually it (Para) had us moved to Hack Forums. All three of us would eventually graduate, under the tutelage of of a few other teachers; namely T3h Hack3r, Infallible, Miah, The Sneak, and the former leader. Personally, I haven't kept exact track of how many people I've helped, but it is probably in the hundreds range.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: That's a great accomplishment. You should be proud 🙂. What keeps you on Hack Forums right now? Tell me about the groups you're in!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: Well, as of now I am only in three groups. I am a teacher in MRT, as well as The Alliance. I run a sector there, but I need to get that back on its feet soon. Though, as of recent I am also helping to rewrite the Help Docs. Right now, these are the only groups I actually want to be in, and hopefully I can keep it like this. For now I'll keep up with those, and help out as many users as I can.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: You're doing a great job as far as I can tell. Do you have any goals on the forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: Well, only 3 goals really. I want to lead a group, make it so that MRT will last as long as HF does, and maybe Staff or Mentor. MRT is a priority, and always will be for me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: I can see you achieving those pretty soon 😝. What are your IRL hobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: I'm mostly focused on school. Though, I am very found oh physics as well as science in general. I have a proclivity to enjoy anything that is mathamatic really. I also do tons of writing, for various things. I also have a job, which cuts into a lot of my time. One of my other hobbies is Latin. While it is a language, a huge part of my life is dedicated to it. I go to competitions yearly based around it, and it is quite fun.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: Thanks so much for participating in the interview, RDCA. Hopefully people will know more about you now! Do you have a closing statement/final words?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][b]RDCA[/b][/url]: Valete!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][b][color=#FFBB00]Connected[/color][/b][/url]: If you have any comments/suggestions/ideas/feedback for the interviews.

Is there any particular reason for all these contributions and accomplishments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=white][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] Friends and the atmosphere. I've made some really good contacts and connections here on this site. It's easy to navigate and find decent sections that you may be interested in. I felt that I had to somehow give back to the community, since, I didn't really feel that I've contributed what-so-ever.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=880177][color=#00BFFF][b]Milf:[/b][/color][/url] I see that you're in several groups, what did you to do to earn a spot in each individual group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=white][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] I think that all of my previous work and contributions has lead me to become a loyal member of both groups that I'm currently in.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=880177][color=#00BFFF][b]Milf:[/b][/color][/url] Did anyone or something here at HF affect your personal or social life? If so, explain why.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=white][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url] The community has actually made me think about some things for my personal life. Hold your tongue if you don't have anything nice to say. Think before you speak, excetera. My social life? Yes, I spend too much time here. 😝\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=880177][color=#00BFFF][b]Milf:[/b][/color][/url] All these accomplishments you've made, what makes you enthusiastic enough to continue your experience at here at HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=white][b]Clique:[/b][/color][/url]I love meeting new people, creating new friendships and socializing with the community.

It's a much easier process because they're actually recognized by the government. This is a huge thing.\" \"This was a lengthy process; we had a lot of people fighting for this. It wasn't something that happened overnight,\" Allen continued. Riot had to provide enough evidence to the US Government to prove that the game is a proper sport. This is a very big step for eSports and the gaming community.\n\n[color=white][b]GTA 5 Customization[/b][/color]\nIn an interview with Rockstar's Associate Technical Director and Combat Designer Phil Hooker, he explains that the game will have a lot more customizability with guns and vehicles. \"Ammunation makes its return in GTA V, but now you can indeed customise your weapons. The player has access to a wide range of modifications, such as extended clips that allow you to fire more ammo between reloads, grips to improve your accuracy, weapon tints to colour your guns, flashlights, scopes, and suppressors,\" Sarwar revealed. \"Attachments such as suppressors allow the player to adapt their approach to some missions and take a stealth option. It's all part of broadening the range of tactical options for the player.\" \"In addition to the many cosmetic customisation alterations such as body kits, paint jobs/finishes, wheels, exhaust tips, window tints, tire smoke colour, bull-bars, extra lights, and lots of other extra accessories, we have modifications that will affect gameplay and vehicle performance,\" said Sarwar talking to GI. \"Some of the modifications that affect gameplay include brakes, engine tuning, suspension, horns, bulletproof tires, panel armour, and of course, a general repair! There are more than 1,000 modifications in total. And when you're done customising your car, you can take a picture of it using the in-game cell phone and upload them to the Social Club.\" It seems the game will feature a lot of new content that everyone will love. GTA 5 will launch on Xbox 360 and PS3 on September 17th. If for whatever you missed the official gameplay trailer uploaded by Rockstar, you can view the video below. Until then, you can check out the GTA 5 mega thread created by Bullet.

Various issues such as broken sprint behavior, irrational FPS, and random horse damage have been fixed. Horses now can run freely in the wild without taking random damage from walls, trees, or anything else inanimate in their surroundings.\n\nIn addition to said bug fixes, Mojang also threw in a little unmentioned surprise-- baby zombies. Baby zombies can spawn both as regular zombies or village zombies, but however are much faster and rampant than the regular zombies.

The verdict is of a case that captured the nation’s attention and will be apart of American history. For George Zimmerman it means trying to return back to his normal life after he was at the center of national attention. The not-guilty verdict was decided by a jury of six women, who spent more than 15 hours over the course of two days on the case, concluding that Zimmerman justifiably used deadly force. The jury determined that he reasonably believed such force was “necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm” to himself (Florida’s definition of self-defense). As the verdict was being read Zimmerman showed no emotion, after the verdict had been read he smiled slightly and shook hands with one of his lawyers. Zimmerman’s team had a feeling of euphoria while on the other hand Trayvon’s family faced a huge letdown. Many people seem to be upset by the verdict while others do not. This case will surely be imprinted in American history.\n\n[color=white][b]Lost Egyptian City Found Underwater After 1,200 Years[/b][/color]\nThe legendary port of Thonis-Heracleion has been found underwater after approximately 1,200 years. For centuries it was thought to be a legend, a city of extraordinary wealth. The city founded around the 8th century BC, well before the foundation of Alexandria in 331 BC. It is believed that Heracleion was a major obligatory port of entry to Egypt for all ships coming from the Greek world. Prior to its discovery by archaeologist Frank Goddio and his team in 2000, no trace of Thonis-Heracleion had been found. The Greeks knew the city as Thonis and the Egyptians knew it as Heracleion. The city was discovered underwater 6.5 kilometers off today’s coastline and about 150 feet underwater. The team found many things in the underwater city including the remains of 64 ships, gold coins, giant 16 foot statues with hundreds of smaller statues of minor gods, slabs of stone inscribed in both ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian, and much more.\n\n[color=white][b]Egypt ‘freezes assets’ of Muslim Brotherhood Leaders[/b][/color]\nThe Muslim Brotherhood head Mohammed Badie and his deputy Khairat al-Shater are reported to be included in this. Mr. Badie and other leaders of The Muslim Brotherhood are already the subject of arrest warrants, while the ousted President Mohammed Morsi remains in custody. As many as 14 Islamist leaders have had their assets frozen, according to judicial sources. On Sunday, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi defended the decision to remove the president from power. In a speech, he also said that no group would be barred from politics: “Every political force… must realize that an opportunity is available for everyone in political life and no ideological movement is prevented from participation.”\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbirdFfeOijxAv.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center]Due to unforeseen complications and a lack of internet access, the Tech News was unable to be completed by this edition.\nMy apologies, this will be sorted out by the next edition.[/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jsSqf056c30Ww.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Miley Cyrus' 'We Can't Stop' Gets Cleaned Up By Rebecca Black[/b][/color]\nFor the fans who have been loving Miley's new style, they might not like the fact that her new music video, 'We Can't Stop' was sweetened up, and made for all audiences. Rebecca Black, known for her song, 'Friday,' has created a music video with her friend singing the hit song. Her friend Jon and her sang the song acoustically, and calmly compared to Miley's version. This is quite a surprise from some because many people thought Rebecca Black died down after her song did, but she has emerged after her long break. Considering Rebecca Black is 16, she didn't get 'down-and-dirty\" like the 'Queen of Twerk' which is Miley Cyrus. She has also replaced some of Miley's dirt referenced lyrics to a  'PG' rating, so \"To my homegirls here with the big butts/Shakin' it like we at a strip club\" becomes \"To my homegirls here, living it up/Feeling alive and are in love,\" and \"trying to get a line in the bathroom\" line is removed entirely. Surprisingly enough, some people are saying Black's song is way better than Miley's original. A great comeback for people who've enjoyed Black's music.\n\n[color=white][b]Lady Gaga Returns[/b][/color]\nFor all the \"Little Monsters\" curious about Gaga's status on stage, it's been 149 days since she has last performed. She had gone through surgery and she happened to end up in rehab to recover. She has been out so long, that she missed the return of Justin Timberlake, Daft Punk, as well as Lil Wayne, Kanye West and Jay-Z's new albums. Also, the duo Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' status on the \"Hot 100.\" The past five months have felt sempiternal to Gaga. She wants to be out, hanging with fans, singing, and just having fun as always. In her eyes, pop music has been boring, and no effort has been put in. When she recovers, she hopes to bring it back to life, so to say. Fans are awaiting her release, and her comeback is going to be the best there ever was.\n\n[color=white][b]Ke$ha Wants to Judge on The Voice[/b][/color]\nOut of all the crazy things she has done in her life, this might be the craziest thing she has done her whole career. She stated that she would love to participate as a judge on the show 'The Voice' sometime. She stated, \"One day I would love to do something like that but right now I'm traveling the world and playing my new record, which I thoroughly enjoy, but when I'm done with that then maybe yeah, sure.\" She wants to be a judge because she said she would be honest and tell the truth to the candidates participating in the show. Her new single, Crazy Kids featuring Will.i.am has been used to show that she knows what she is doing and that she is capable of actually judging others' work.\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPQMfcjQL5M[/video]\n[/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jj0OFp0aBuwTS.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nSleep is a beautiful thing. As I sit here, finishing up the HF News with this last section, sleep is quite literally the only thought in my head. My day has been wrought with activity and my last week or so has been an endless torment of work and early mornings. Once I finish this paragraph and move this edition, I will force my computer into hibernation and slink of to the blissful and comforting warmth of my sheets. Peace be to you. Sleep well.",
