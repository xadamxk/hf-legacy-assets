These editions will be trimmed down to focus on material solely about the site itself. If you're interested in joining, check the Groups & Crews News section for the Information thread to learn more.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffffff][b]BYTES BONUS DAYS[/b][/color]\r\nUntil June 5th, users will gain an increased amount of bytes for posts and threads. This is a celebration of HF's Official Holiday known as \"Goodwill Monday.\" This event is limited to upgraded members, with L33t members receiving 1.5x and Ub3r members receiving 2x the normal values.

This brings the cost for a complete rebrand to 100,000 bytes in total. Group owners had stated that the cost of a rebrand for an official group was far above the previously low cost that came with a Crew rebrand.\r\n[size=x-small][color=#44B8FF][i]source;[/i][/color] [url=https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6238952&pid=61938871#pid61938871][b]Crew Fee Increases[/b][/url][/size]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=561239][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v5/honors-hydra.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]USER NEWS[/b][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*].
