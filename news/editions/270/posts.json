Before contacting an Administrator to remove invalid reputation, you must first paste canned text informing the member of their invalid comments and prompting them to correct it. If 24 hours pass and it remains unchanged, you may then report it. For your account's sake, we recommend reading the updated help document and combing through your given reps.

So, lets start out here, tell us a bit about yourself, what brings you to Hack Forums? And what kept your interest in the community?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: I joined Hack Forums, because I was programming Runescape bots and was interested in joining a community that enjoyed programming as much as I did. I quickly lost interest in creating RS bots once I found the .NET Framework section, I made some great friends in there that I still have to this day. The section had a great community and was an excellent learning resource for years.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: Well there certainly is no argument you are one of the communities most well known and prominent programmers.  Before we get in to what I would think are some obvious question, you noted that upon joining Hack Forums you were programming Runescape bots before finding the .NET architecture, what other programming languages did you know before moving to .NET?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: Before I moved to .NET I was pretty fluent in Java, but that's about it. After I learned .NET most other programming languages with a C style syntax kind of just clicked, as they all follow pretty similar patterns.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: So you transitioned from a relative script type based language to the more formal block styled code format.  I must admit, coming from Java Runescape bots to programming one of the most complex and powerful Remote Administrative Tools is one big turn around, given you have been a member since 2011, to do this within a 4 year span is also quite impressive.  So whats the secret to successful programming?  Any tips for those interested in getting started?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: Well I started learning Java probably a year and a half before I joined Hack Forums, and the part of the bot I was working on wasn't the scripts, I was working on the back end portion of the bot which was quite difficult. So the move from Java to .NET wasn't to difficult.\nThere is no real \"secret\" to successful programming, the way I got as experienced as I did in such a short amount of time was simply because I loved doing it, I practiced literally every day for years, Also the constant competition in the .NET Section kept things pretty interesting and fun.\nMy only tip for beginners is, make sure you actually enjoy programming. Don't try to learn to code if your sole purpose of doing so is to make money, of course you can have ambitions to make money, but make sure you're having fun also, otherwise you'll get nowhere.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: Very good advice.  Unless you enjoy what you are doing, it just becomes another mundane job.  So I suppose to cover the obvious question, is what brought you from Programming Gaming bots to development of powerful remote administrative software?  and Why?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: Well I always saw Remote Administration Tools as sort of the \"final boss\" of programming. You need to know almost everything to do in with the OS you're developing on and the language you're programming in to create one from scratch. I could list everything you need to know to develop a program on the scale of Imminent Monitor, but that'd be tedious.\nTo give you an idea, Imminent Monitor was developed for almost a year and a half before the release of version 1.0 in April 2013.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: It is so very true and a known complexity for the programmers involved, how to incorporate all central machine command and control in to a single binary without causing system conflict.  Since IM's initial release back in 2013, a lot has happened including the Black Shades network take down.  What has kept you developing the software with what can be considered clear known risks to those involved?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: I personally think that there is 0 risk involved in running my business. I don't put Imminent Monitor in the same category as software such as the products you mentioned. They fully condoned malicious use of their software and advertised it as such.\nWe are a fully registered business, have multiple lawyers, pay taxes, we actually enforce our terms. If a user is a reported or we find a user using Imminent Monitor for malicious purposes, their license [b]will[/b] be terminated.\nImminent Monitor is as the title suggests, for monitoring employees, your children, it's also a great sysadmin tool, I use it myself for this purpose, I have also linked it to multiple webcams in my house as sort of a home security system.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: Very true, if I recall correctly it was originally credit card fraud that got the developer of Black Shades in initial trouble with the law enforcement to begin with.  There is a very fine line to be drawn with application of certain software as powerful as Imminent Monitor.  It is important for users to be aware of such risks.  As it stands, I can only agree with what you have stated for its monitoring functionality.\nAre there any other projects you have been working on other than Imminent Monitor?  I know the development and constant support takes up a lot of your time already, but one would like to believe you still have side projects.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: I do have side projects, but nothing I'm looking to market. \nI enjoy creating desktop clients for various websites that I use such as Youtube which includes emulating all requests/javascript that gets executed on the site and passing all the data to a readable format whilst mirroring the same user experience provided by the site.\nBut most of my work goes into Imminent Monitor as it is an infinitely expanding project that I'll never stop improving.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: And a project I believe every user is looking forward to seeing further development.  You mentioned you were working on a big update for this coming holiday season, any sneak preview insight you would be willing to share with us?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: The update will include many back end changes that will improve speeds and stability, and some new features which are a surprise ;). \nI will however show off some visual aspects of the update, the main window is Christmas inspired https://i.imgur.com/aUlLQRl.png and a feature almost all my customers have wanted in the past, stack able notifications https://gfycat.com/SafeMixedBaboon\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: Very cool...   Well we have to wrap it up here, but before we go.  If you were given the opportunity to change or improve anything on the site, what would it be?\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: If I could change anything on HF, I would implement a name and shame system similar to the scammer database, targeting Marketers who buy projects from coders, sell it for ~2 months and abandon the project including the (sometimes large) customer base, because they can't manage the product. \nTo me these people are worse than scammers because they get away with it, it's a growing issue on Hack Forums that I don't think will cease anytime soon.\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=952566][color=#87CEFA][b]ɅʁɱªÐą[/b][/color][/url]: I can only agree, although the Market place is one of the most unique and versatile available, it does come with its fair share of problems at times too.  Maybe this is something for staff to consider for the future.\nWell, thanks for your time and I hope you have a great Holidays!\n\n[url=http://Hack Forums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=741482][color=#FFFFFF][b]Shockwave[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks for taking the time to interview me, I've always wanted to be on the HF News.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The FBI has announced that they use \"special hacking code\" (zero-day exploits) to gain access to a person's computer without permission. Instead of the FBI telling software manufacturers about these on-going vulnerabilities, the FBI use them to their advantage without the manufacturers having prior knowledge. The FBI has stated that they are spying on their own citizens for the \"greater good\". Privacy specialists believe that federal judges do not fully understand the ability the FBI posses by being able to use these zero-day exploits, thus allowing the FBI to take advantage.\n\n[url=http://www.cnet.com/news/donald-trump-wants-to-shut-down-the-internet/][b][color=white]Trump Poses a Threat to the Virtual World[/color][/b][/url]\nDonald Trump has struck the public yet again by announcing he wants to \"shut off the internet\". This is not the first ludicrous idea Trump has had. Trump, current nominee for President of the United States, proposes the closure of the internet as it could also help resolve the problems surrounding Syria and ISIS. As expected the suggestion was poorly received. Globally known companies such as Amazon and Cisco has not responded to Donald Trump, but has made it known that this is far from a worthwhile discussion. If Trump was given the go ahead to do so, he would either have to get internet providers to corporate or send in the US troops.\n\n[url=https://threatpost.com/google-updates-chrome-extends-safe-browsing-to-chrome-for-android/115607/][b][color=white]Google Takes Extra Precautions With Chrome[/color][/b][/url]\nGoogle has recently released an update for the Chrome browser, with an update for Adobe Flash Player. Within the recent updates, Google has announced the patching of several exploits and has now made browsing safer for Android users. When browsing with an Android smartphone, the browser now regularly checks entered URLs with an internal database which hosts malicious sites. Whilst Google focuses on browser security, they also try not to constantly update the browser due to battery consumption and memory. As of November, the browser also helps to protect online users from social engineering attempts.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/HackingNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Wires.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/12/mackeeper-antivirus-hacked_14.html][b][color=white]Anti-Virus Company, MacKeeper, Breached and Leaked[/color][/b][/url]\nThe anti-virus company MacKeeper has finally had a lapse in security, resulting in the exposure of 13 million online users. It seems as if the company which pledges to aid people's online protection, need to protect themselves first and foremost. An ethical hacker, Chris Vickery, first discovered the breach by simply entering a range of IP addresses which later led to the disclosure of 13 million customer records.

The process took less than 48 hours. CTurt indicated and claimed on Twitter, an exploit named \"FreeBSD Kernal\" had been used to assist the jail breaking process. The official announcement by CTurt can be found [url=https://twitter.com/CTurtE/]here[/url]. The hacker has also informed the public that the jailbreak will only work for the firmware 1.76. Sony is now currently working on how to make the most recent firmware of Playstation 4 much more secure.\n\n[url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2015/11/researcher-discovers-flaws-in-telekoms.html][b][color=white]Telekom Left With a Fatal Vulnerability[/color][/b][/url]\nA new vulnerability has been found in the German telecommunications company, Telekom. According to an Egyptian researcher named Ebrahim Hegazy, any attacker with the wrong intention would have been able to take over the Telekom server with ease. The vulnerability found within the telecommunications company is known as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. A basic vulnerability at that. Hegazy had discovered this vulnerability by simply sending malicious requests and pings to open ports. Telekom has now patched the vulnerability and is now working to make sure nothing like this is discovered again.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/world/americas/syria-refugees-arrive-in-canada.html?src=me][b][color=white]Canada Welcomes Syrian Refugees With Open Arms[/color][/b][/url]\nAt a time when much of the world is in turmoil over the Syrian refugee crisis, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed up to personally greet some of the first refugees landing in a Toronto airport on Friday. While opinions in the United States range from accepting refugees, to complete banishment, Canada plans to remain faithful to its pledge to accept 25,000 refugees by the end of February. Even the various opposing political parties, while arguing over small details, have generally agreed upon the plan. When greeting some of the new arrivals, Trudeau told them \"you're safe at home now\", and said “This is a wonderful night where we get to show not just a plane load of new Canadians what Canada is all about, but we get to show the world how to open our hearts and welcome people who are fleeing extraordinarily difficult straits”. The resettlement of refugees is largely dependent on sponsorship groups or individuals, who have been raising money to help arrange for housing, education, and other costs for the Syrians.\n\n[url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/30/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-candidates/index.html][b][color=white]Saudi Women to Vote for the First Time in History[/color][/b][/url]\nOver 900 women are running for public office in Saudi Arabia, which is entirely unprecedented in the ultra-conservative kingdom. In 2011 the late King Abdullah began making steps toward granting women certain freedoms, including their right to vote, and run for certain offices. While participation for women is still limited to the municipal level, it is a huge step in a culture that is known for extreme oppression of women. This will be the first time a woman has been allowed to vote in any election in the history of Saudi Arabia. For the women campaigning for office, there are still many restrictions in place that have made the process difficult. Saudi women are not allowed to drive cars, or go anywhere without their male guardian. Due to these vast gaps in equality, some critics say that the election holds little meaning at all. While it may not mean drastic life changes for Saudi women anytime soon, it is certainly a step in the right direction. \n\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35067238][b][color=white]Two Police Officers Charged With Murder of Six Year Old Boy[/color][/b][/url]\nTwo police officers were indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for the murder of six year old Jeremy Mardis. The boy was traveling with his father in a car, and were being pursued by the officers. The reason they were chasing Jeremy's father is still unknown. Officers Stafford and Greenhouse opened fire at the car during a traffic stop, wounding Jeremy's father Chris Few, and killing Jeremy. The officers are reported to have fired eighteen rounds at the car. Both officers have been charged with one count of second-degree murder, and one count of attempted second-degree murder. An officer who was present and the time of the incident said that he did not fire his weapon because \"he didn't fear for his life\" according to court records. Tragedies like this one have become all to common place in the United States, and the debate regarding police brutality and escalated use of force continues unabated. \n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

This is also the first of many updates. Up until June 2016, Halo will continue to release free updates for its players. Halo's release has been more than positively received from its community. Halo 5 was the first Halo to be released without a forge mode - now gamers will be able to create their own maps. In addition, the new maps include Overgrowth, Antifreeze and Entombed.

League of Legends (LoL) is now owned by a Chinese company named Tencent. Tencent is an investor in multiple gaming communities. Employees of LoL will now be compensated differently than they were before the ownership change. Whether this will bring displeasure or excitement is still unclear. Tencent is now one of the leading gaming companies, if not the biggest and leading gaming company in the world.

A brand-new organization called OpenAI, however, which is headed by the likes of Elon Musk and Sam Altman, the CEO of Y Combinator, aims to use AI to \"benefit humanity,\" without worrying about profit. According to Musk, the collective goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. The organization is launching with $1 billion in funding from prominent tech luminaries including LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, and Amazon Web Services.\r\n\r\n[color=white][url=http://bgr.com/2015/12/11/mit-untraceable-sms-text-messaging/][b]New Untraceable SMS Text Messaging System Apparently More Secure Than Tor[/b][/url][/color]\r\nTo fight this growing concern of data traffic monitoring, computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new SMS text messaging system that is untraceable and apparently even more secure than the Tor anonymity network, in order to create truly anonymous communications. The researchers have named the system “Vuvuzela,” which is a reference to the noise-making devices used by fans at football matches around the world. The idea behind the system is that, like a stadium full of vuvuzelas, it creates a lot of spurious “noise” that makes it difficult to pinpoint the sound being made by any individual vuvuzela.\r\n\r\n[color=white][url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/114316/20151209/microsoft-surface-overtakes-apple-s-ipad-as-top-selling-tablet-online.htm][b]Microsoft Surface Surpasses the iPad in Online Sales[/b][/url][/color]\r\n[/align]\r\nThanks to its iPad family, Apple has placed number one on the ‘Top Brands’ chart for US tablet sales throughout 2015.
