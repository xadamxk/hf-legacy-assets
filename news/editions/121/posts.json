The change comes after an announcement via Twitter was made by site owner [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] last week, which was previously reported in the News. As part of the transition, the group had been given a new userbar and graduate award, as well as the renaming of the group's forums. The change is part of a large revamp of the group after a period of semi-dormancy. The group will begin recruiting for potential members who will be trained for a long period of time (12+ months) to help fellow HF members in their public forum.\n\n[b][color=white]The Corporation Convenes Business[/color][/b]\nTibit's history-making, second group has officially become The Corporation. The group was purchased by Tibit weeks ago while it was still the very active group Rhythm. The surprising move that angered many Rhythmers came as a big surprise to many unsuspecting members at the time of the purchase, but even more surprising was the group's purpose. Tibit and fellow leader Aeon  kept this under wraps while the group officially transitioned to The Corporation. According to the group's announcement thread, The Corporation is \"a group of innovators, those who bring quality products to the marketplace and are known for their business prowess\". The group is invite only, but is currently holding a video contest for membership which can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3081789]here[/url]. Meanwhile, Tibit and Aeon both continue to bribe their way into the hearts of members, with evil upgrade contests, found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3077227]here[/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3077182]here[/url].

To start off, we have the two new ficons, which [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] added to the FPS and Military Style Gaming subforum and the Survey Says forum. This move has helped ease many members suffering with OCD. Next on the list is a new Minecraft subforum for server management. The forum is already heavily populated with threads about various server issues for the moneymakers of this forum. And finally, we have the mysterious Spy award that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has recently added. No one knows exactly what the award is all about, but The Man gave us this to go off of: \"For those HF Spies that are everywhere. Trust no one\". Spooky. Appropriately enough, the award's icon is a ghost.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jHAVGLpCK2X3O.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#0066FF][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url] reached 10,000 posts!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451][color=#0066FF][b]Yellows[/b][/color][/url] reached 20,000 posts again!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=849324][color=black][b]Text[/b][/color][/url] had his posting privileges permanently removed.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=195796][b]phybeя[/b][/url] reached 2,000 reputation points and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=67718][b]PubMaster[/b][/url] reached 1,000 reputation points!

Shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Thanks, I feel welcomed <3 I'd like to give a shoutout to, Bugga, iNviZ, Yellows, Tibit & Genuine <3\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Firstly, why don't you tell us about how your HF journey started; over two years ago!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Well, I joined HF in 2010, I was never really active at first, I joined because I really wanted to learn programming, it was something I wanted to do for a long time so I kind of roamed around the section and looked at loads of tutorials, I figured out black hat wasn't my thing so I learned GDI and I was pretty good at it... Now I'm kind of lazy around hf, just try to help people out no more programming or anything for me now <3\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: And could you tell us how you met up with your life partner, Yellows?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Lol, I met him in tinychat, quite funny I never really heard of him or spoke to him but we met in tinychat and it was great, we had such a good laugh ;) he really isn't my life partner <33 ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Sure. Whatever you say ;). Moving on... how has HF impacted your life IRL - both positively and negatively.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Well, negatively first it does take up a lot of my time and whatnot but it's great, I mean it's something I really enjoy doing... Positively, well I gained being Leader of Empire, something I never ever thought about being on HF was a Leader of an Official group... It was great being able to get that chance to take part in, I mean I don't think HF has really affected me negatively much <33\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Leading on from what you mentioned about The Empire, I'm aware groups play a major role in your HF life. Which groups have you been a part of and why did you stick with them?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Well, I've been a part of a lot of groups on HF, Techsperts, Empire, 143, Illuminati, Emenice, I think I could be hear all night saying them, but the main ones I really like are Empire, 143 and Illuminati, I've stuck with them because of Tibit helping me through a hard time and I can't thank him enough.. 143, Daisy, Well.... Daisy.... She's wonderful, she won't let me ever leave the group, I don't want to because it's a good group and Illuminati, it's an amazing group, I love being in it, I don't do a lot of online money making though but you know, I don't know why I'm in there <333 but I love it, it's great <333\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Good to hear. I suppose you know what it's like being on the other side of the interview (as the interviewer), since you were an interviewer for a matter of months. What do you think makes an interview interesting?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Hmm, it all depends on what type of person you're talking to, I mean it can always be interesting in it's own way <3 ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Very true. I feel an interesting interviewee brings the interviewer inspiration. :3\nAnd also a bit on spontaneousness. Do you buy free range eggs and/or chicken? Why/why not?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Well easy to say, nah, eggs are eggs and chicken is chicken, tastes the same <33 ;)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Being Scottish, you must like wearing skirts. Do you feel it refreshing to wear skirts? Kind of like freeballing? Do you freeball when you wear a kilt?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: I've really only wore a kilt once, it was good it was at my mums wedding, it was really fun but I had to wear boxers underneath sadly <333\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Oh that sucks. On a more serious note, why do you think HF is so successful?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: Just because of the community, I mean Omni should feel proud he made such a good site, I mean it wouldn't be where it is today if it wasn't for all the members <33\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1018876][color=#00BFFF][b]Phytrix[/b][/color][/url]: Agreed. I'll let you get back to Yellows now. Any final thoughts or comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=516470][color=#98FB98][b]SoulZeh[/b][/color][/url]: I'd like to thank you for having me here... <33\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview - [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=#98FB98]Codevade[/color][/url][/font][/size][/color]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: For the 121st edition of the HF News, we've snuck a Get Out of Jail Free! card to Codevade. Any shoutouts or comments you'd like to make before we continue?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: Sure, first off I would like to say thanks for having me, I would like to give a shoutout to the following users of HackForums, my dearest and oldest friend, Sir, as well as, iNviZ, Bugga, Riggs, Judge Dredd, Andrew Downsend, Alone Vampire, Baked, BV1 ツ, Defcon‌, Fatality, iMario, ImXpert, Orgy, Saga, Tɦɛ Gʀiɱ, Xinfiltrate and ¤ Nick™ ¤.\nAnd many others I do not have room for.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Lots of those guys are from your own group, the Marketers. What gave you the idea for the group, and how did you get it off the ground?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: About a year and a half ago, I was already a very popular member on HF and sales were excellent here on HF. I decided to purchase a group and Master Donator. I believed it took me about 1 week of sales to get the required funds ready, I knew someday this group would return a huge amount of funds as it can now, since there are no more groups being made it turns into a $3500+ asset that can be liquidated. \nNot many know this but I originally started the group with Vanadium and decided to remove him later. Grim was accepted on the recruitment thread and soon after recruited to leader. I actually met him on the recruitment thread. The original idea was to help others make money and to make an amazing group people would want to be in, and so we did that. Originally, the group was invite only and there wasn't even a recruitment thread for the first few weeks, we then made very strict requirements and let only the best of the best in and turned it into the most wanted and exclusive group to be in at the time, about 8 - 10 months ago we started selling access and that was one of the best ideas I have ever had. So many other groups tried it and were never able to pull it off like we did. We were and in my opinion, still are the the most wanted to be in group on HF and we have a lot of dedicated, loyal and amazing members which are also popular of HF.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: The Marketers group is filled with original content, like you mentioned with pay-for-spot. What other things has your group done in terms of originality?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: We have several things we have done. We have created the first ever group on HF to be related to Marketing and making money, We have a \"Seal Of Approval\" Marketers members can use to show their support for the group, and we were the first Group to publicly sell spots on a sales thread, and there are many more original ideas and group innovations coming very soon since I am able to operate the group again. I was in Jail for a while.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Can you describe exactly what happened to get you in jail, or is that confidential/personal?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: Real life credit card fraud. I was only caught because others were caught and helped the police to find me. There were 11 felonies I believe. I am out now and awaiting sentencing. I can still go to prison for it but it wouldn't be long since I am a first time offender. I was only in jail for 2 months until I was able to raise the money to get out, a very hefty sum I may add.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Glad you're back with us all. How did you accumulate so much knowledge with monetizing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: I actually have little to no knowledge in monetizing, The only thing I know how to do very well is sales on HF and I am an excellent security exploiter and I know how to market just about any product so that it will be extremely popular. I also am very good with networking and other computer related things.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Have you made a significant profit from your security research, or is it a hobby?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: Both; I enjoy doing what I love and making an excellent amount of money from it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Are there any future changes for the Marketers now that you're active again? Or will things proceed as they were before?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: A lot of changes have already taken place, the Subforum is filled with activity, methods, and more giveaways than ever. We have 2 very new exciting group related events that will happen within the next week that will further our goals as the Marketers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#0066FF][b]+Entity[/b][/color][/url]: Can't wait to hear about them. Any closing comments you'd like to make to wrap things up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=209490][color=white][b]Codevade[/b][/color][/url]: Sure, I'd like to thank you for the interview and wish you a happy holidays.\n[/spoiler]",

Irrational announced this week that the upcoming game, Bioshock Infinite will be delayed and pushed to March 26, 2013 which is a month later than expected previously. “It’s primarily polish and bug fixing,” “You know, 'let’s make that narrative scene that much better. Let’s do another pass on the timing of that scene. Let’s do another balance pass.’ It’s a game we could have shipped in February. It just wouldn’t be the game that we think the fans deserve. And that doesn’t mean it was far off from that, but they deserve what they deserve. And when we ask people to pony up a lot of money for this game, we have to feel confident that we’re giving them something that they deserve.” - Creative Director Ken Levine.\n\n[color=white][b]Halo 4: Spartan Ops 2013 Return Dated[/b][/color]\nSpartan Ops is taking a short break as previously mentioned by 343 Industries. 343 originally said the sixth episode will hit sometime in January, however Microsoft and 343 have now narrowed it down to an exact date.

The Canadian government has approved the deal in this instance, but they have vowed to block any future attempts at an acquisition. The sale of the company has caused critics to argue that such a purchase gives China too much influence in the Canadian oil industry. Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated, \"Foreign state control of oil sands development has reached the point at which further such foreign state control would not be of net benefit to Canada. Therefore, going forward, the minister [of industry] will find the acquisition of control of a Canadian oil sands business by a foreign state-owned enterprise to be of net benefit only in an exceptional circumstance.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Nelson Mandela in the Hospital[/color][/b]\nNelson Mandela, Former President of South Africa, has checked in the hospital to have some tests.

Flying Lotus...? Hmm?[/color][/b]\nFor any of you guys who closely follow the West Coast Rap community, you may know about Captain Murphy. Yes, the guy with the cult-esque references in his songs, extremely raw lyricism and the shrouded mystery around him and his identity. Ever since he appeared on Between Friends, a song that featured Earl Sweatshirt of Odd Future, he's been the talk of all blogs. A few weeks ago, he released his first mixtape dubbed \"Duality\" and can be found here http://captainmurphy.xxx/ . Following the release, Captain Murphy ended up playing a show in California which led to his identity being finally released. Turned out he was the hip-hop DJ and producer Flying Lotus and Captain Murphy will be his rapping form. It's safe to see we will see much coming from this artist in the next few months.\n\n[b][color=white]Affection[/color][/b]\nThe well renowned punk-techno dude that is Crystal Castles has recently released a snippest of what is to come. Following the dark titles that were \"Plague\" and \"Wrath of God\", this new release is one to rejoice about! With its soothing, upbeat instrumentals, along with the female whispering in the background and that is a staple of Crystal Castles, the title will surely be a good peek into what's to come!\nwww.soundcloud.com/crystal-castles/crystal-castles-affection\n\n[b][color=white]Dave Brubeck Dead at 91[/color][/b]\nIf you were a listener to jazz at any point within the classic days of the 50's-60's, odds are you know who Dave Brubeck was. The jazz legend was en route to the clinic for an appointment with his cardiologist when death knocked on his door. The official release on his death states that he died from heart failure. He will surely be missed, R.I.P.\n\n[hr]\n\n[b][color=white]Playlist of the Week[/color][/b]\nIf you're a fan of indie, and any hipster electro funk released within the last few years, you will love this playlist. I found it on Spotify not long ago and I've been playing it at work and everyone seems to dig it! It's called \"Hipster International\" and has the likes of The Black Keys, Mumford and Sons, LCD Soundsystem and all those other \"hipster\" bands your friends probably make fun of you for listening to. You can check out the playlist HERE, I'm sure you'll enjoy it: http://sharemyplaylists.com/hipster-international-1\n\n[b][color=white]Music Video of the Week[/color][/b]\nThese guys sound like they are from the 60's and it's awesome.\n[spoiler=][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vTY8KEKlmI[/yt][/spoiler]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKQ5rwMHo9quw.png[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nSometimes we do things that we don't mean to do, but we shouldn't truly worry about it. A song comes to mind when I think about this, \"Kill Your Heroes\" by AWOLNATION. In the end, everyone dies. When your time is near, will you truly be thinking about the way you acted to that one guys four years ago? No. Or the way you embarrassed yourself in front of those people a week ago? No. Just live, and let live. Move on. Let. Things. Go.",
