Have any shoutouts you want to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Id like to shout out, ThePonyWizard and Zayne + all the members in insight for helping me learn.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Well, speaking of Insight, what is it? Care to explain it to us?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Well insight is a group that follows a sort of philosophy, that knowledge should be free, we also follow the thought that if you wish to receive help you should be dedicated enough to put in work. The group at the moment is focused on helping the hf community by filling it with guides to help those new members who join for specific info, and to benefit members who are confused. We are also offering free mentorship we have had many applicants and we wish we could help them all, but we can only help those willing to help themselves. I am not sure what to say really.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What do you want to achieve with Insight?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Just helping the community out is more than enough pleasure for our members in the group. It would be nice if we could become an official group as it would be easier to manage my lessons and inform members, but since I learnt how to work without it, its not a priority.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] That's really great to hear! Honestly, your group has done a lot more recently than any other group I know of. What do you think about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Well, honestly if you look through the skype chat logs you can see that our main focus was to help hf out. Pushing out 13 community things in 5 days felt great, of course the group would be nothing without our members, but i can assure you, there will be about 10 more guides/projects coming out within the next few days so stay tuned. Including a forum where you can see guides before there release.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I'm really looking forward to the future of this group. What gave you this idea to create Insight?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Just observing what null has been doing and how there members have helped me obtain knowledge. I feel like i should give back to the community. To be completely honest also creating inside was also for my benefit, i myself are not skilled in all fields and here still willing to learn and take on different peoples perspective. I have seen councillors at my old school and they said i learn best as a collaborative worker and i believe others do to, most people these days cant pay attention to books so it would be easier for me to research and others to research and then discuss the topic and all learn from each other.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Ah, I see. What exactly does your group have to offer, topic-wise?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] We have specialists within all fields, a few that i can list from the top of my head are.[list]\n[*]networking\n[*]cyber security\n[*]doxing\n[*]graphical design\n[*]pen testing\n[*]marketing\n[*]cryptography\n[*]bot networking\n[*]monetising[/list]\nWe are trying to offer any topic we host votes often to allow the members to choose what topic they want, and if its something non of us cover we will find someone who will be able to help. We currently have ex-blackhand members working with us and null members helping\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. How do you manage all of this without a SF or a HF group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] At the moment everything is organised over multiple spreadsheets (incl private pastebin links that state what homework is and due date), i would be able to show you those in private as it contains member information that i don't know if they would want publically released. We also are very active on TeamSpeak and skype, our members are supportive to each other and inform members about homework and due dates, hopefully if we get funding it gets easier but that's not a priority, we can manage fine how we are and if things get to difficult it would make great time for us to use our private forum.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What would you need the funds for?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] We would use funds for setting up tools for the group. At the moment i have funded our projects from my pocket and am willing to continue to do that to an extent. The funds would be used for managing our websites and projects + tools such as offshore vps's for our pentesting lessons, as we progress we will face hardships but we can overcome.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] You really have this whole Insight group planned out. Have you been planning this for a while?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] No be brutally honest, no. I started planning the group after i got graphics done, the thing that kicked the group of was watching mr robot, and the whole concept of people working together. I know that's a stupid reason to start a group but sometimes you just have to trust your instinct when it comes to decisions. In school i was never getting straight A's in any subject but in the final year i turned it around due to that i discovered group learning is good and my strategies for teaching are what were used on me in school.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] At least you put some action into your ideas. That's always good. What got you started on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] I started on hf like all the other members who get flamed and bombed with negative reps. I came across hf after purchasing some Netflix accounts online, i then did some research and came out with knowledge that sentrymba is the way to go, problem is no youtube tutorials had voice in them, and as i stated before i learn better from people so i asked for help. That didn't end to well but that didn't stop me, i ended joining a group dedicated to it and that started my hf accounts, things just got better from there\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] What has HF taught you?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Hf has taught me things beyond imagination. Hf has taught me one key life skill and that's never to let anyone bring you down. I have met many great friends on there, and build bonds with members. To be honest before hf i was averaging a grade F in it and this year i ended up with a A*. There is not much to really say about this other than valuable life skills.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2214473][color=#D63030][b].Sinister:[/b][/color][/url] I definitely agree with you on that. Thanks for your time, Hinch! Anything you would like to say before we wrap this up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2471116][color=white][b]Hinch:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the opportunity.\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

The routers are believed to have significant flaws, which attacks are able to use remotely allowing them to generate authenticated requests. Analysts also believe attackers are able to take dominant control over any Local Area Networks, proving to be harmful to any connected devices. Experts advise Belkin customers to apply difficult passwords to make it harder for attackers to establish a new session in regards to a customer's WiFi, and web management interface. This problem has still not been resolved, and an efficient solution is still due to be found.

The data breach is said to contain embarrassing details regarding employees, and medical histories. The White House is now in existing talks to shift the responsibility of security clearance investigations away from OPM. U.S officials also believe China was behind the data breach, but still yet to find any liable evidence to support their claim.

Jailbroken iPhone owners have fallen victim to malware which is able to steal iTunes login details, and send them to a remote perpetrator. The malware they call \"KeyRaider\", finds its way into a person's iPhone when a user starts to download shady Chinese applications - as all system security features have been removed. This often leads to stolen payment information used to purchase applications on other iOS devices. Researchers believe this malware has also been used to hold iPhones for ransom, by locking the rightful owner out of their own device.

Users often hear that they should use a different password for every account that they have, but this advanced and privileged user on Bugzilla didn't seem to  follow that advice. His account was compromised using a password from another site whose data was leaked and compromised. Mozilla believes that the attacker may have had access to the account since September 2013. Mozilla shut off the account as soon as they were made aware of the breach. Mozilla said the attack had access to 53 severe security flaws, 10 of which remain unpatched. Mozilla is working hard on a patch for the remaining exploits and hopes to have one soon.

The patched versions are available for Cisco USC 1.0.0.1 and UCS Version 5.2.0.1. Cisco said that the vulnerability was caused by the JavaServer Pages' input validation and this is what allowed unauthenticated file overwriting. Cisco says there are no workarounds, but there are also no known public uses.

A majority of the victims are in the United States. The ransom is typical $200-$500. As is similar to much mobile ransomware, the app infects your device by posing as a valid third party app then tricking you in download it when it is in actuality ransomware. The device then proceeds to encrypt all the data on the phone and only releases and decrypts the data when the ransom is paid. The ransom poses as a United States National Security Agency message saying you need to pay the fine for copyright violation. The trick about this strain of ransomware is the XMPP communications. It makes it much harder for security suites to detect the communications between the ransomware and the server. Remember to be careful hen downloading apps on your mobile device!

Following the skit’s upload to YouTube many gamers began to make death threats and negative remarks about Jimmy Kimmel in response to his opinions on video game streaming. Jimmy Kimmel responded to these threats with another video illustrating both his continued discontent with videogame streaming along with comments from his past video. Again, many gamers were less than enthusiastic about Jimmy Kimmel’s criticisms on YouTube Gaming and videogame streaming in general, leading Jimmy Kimmel to make a third video where he meets with some popular game streamers to see what it is that he’s misunderstanding about the subject. The video ends with his opinions unchanged. The original video containing the skit can be found [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji9KmXwrA5Y]here[/url], his follow-up video can be found [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZJHhM5uKlg]here[/url], and his attempts at understanding the subject can be found [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtZgpEqfoaI]here[/url].

Later, Razer announced their own Xbox One custom controller called the Wildcat that sports many of the functions found on Microsoft’s Elite controller, along with palm grips. This week, PowerA announced the Fusion Pro controller, which has four buttons on the back along with supposedly superior ergonomics. For customization the controller has 225 customizable color combos right out of the box. However, this controller does not let you swap out its d-pad or analog sticks like the Microsoft Elite controller, nor does it come with option grips like the Razer Wildcat. However, this controller’s selling point is almost definitely going to be its price, sitting at $80 USD while the Microsoft Elite and the Razer Wildcat both will each cost $150 USD. This controller, along with the Microsoft Elite and the Razer Wildcat, is set to be released in October.

The change in design is the biggest change in the logo since the 20th century. The design was created with Google’s parent company, Alphabet, in mind, now sharing a similar type. According to Google though, the redesign was to “[show] you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens.\" Google also claims the new logo will show up better across all platforms, with less scaling issues on different devices.

The Model 3 will be a 4 door sedan, and will supposedly be a smaller model than the Model S. It will have a shockingly low price of $35,000, which is a steep discount from the Model S’ which starts at about $70,000. “[The Model 3] will be way different from any other car on the road. But, “in a way that’s really useful and just doesn’t feel like a weird-mobile,” said Musk this week. Tesla will begin to take preorders for the Model 3 in March 2016.

Popular remote controlled toy company Air Hogs will be behind manufacturing and producing the drones.

For many countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany, both agreed that they needed to help and although many agreed many also outcired about more 'immigrants' and that we should be focusing on our own problems here - this was over taking in around 20,000 Syrians. While the world argued Jordan acted and decided to take in over 1.5 million Syrians and help which is more astonishing when you think Jordan's population is an estimated 6 million. Jordan as a country is now under strain, water deliveries come fortnightly and resources are not great for your average citizen but they prefer this and helping over Syrians option of war and potential death. Just to put into scale how many refugees Jordan helped [url=http://i.imgur.com/M4eWTKl.jpg]here is a picture of just one of many refugee camps[/url]. So instead of arguing over a small influx of 20,000, maybe Europe should take a page out of Jordan's book and just start accepting and helping.

Amid reports of Russia's army being deployed in Syria Putin notes: \"To say we're ready to do this today — so far it's premature to talk about this. But we are already giving Syria quite serious help with equipment and training soldiers, with our weapons,\" the state-owned RIA Novosti news agency quoted Mr Putin as saying when asked about Russian intervention in Syria during an economic forum in Vladivostok. \"We really want to create some kind of an international coalition to fight terrorism and extremism,\" Mr Putin said. \"To this end, we hold consultations with our American partners — I have personally spoken on the issue with US President Obama.\" Although Putin is 'helping' he has repeatedly used Russia's UN Security Council veto to support Bashar Assad (Syrian's President) throughout the four-and-a-half-year-long war, which is believed to have claimed some 250,000 lives. Now Russia uses the excuse of increased ISIS activity as to why they are helping.

Britain's public broadcaster, worried about democracy and the free press worldwide, will make the proposals Monday. The plan also includes expanding BBC Arabic coverage in north Africa and the Middle East. The news is welcomed as it allows for more honesty in countries and also allows us to understand other countries better, whether they go through or not is another matter. Reports say \"Broadcasting in North Korea would be difficult because the country routinely blocks the signals. The broadcast could also provoke a diplomatic response from Pyongyang\" but there's always hope. [i][size=x-small][url=http://mashable.com/2015/09/05/bbc-north-korea/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]",
