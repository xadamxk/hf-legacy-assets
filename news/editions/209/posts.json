For those who may not know what [url=http://www.supportforums.net/index.php]SupportForums[/url] is, it is another site that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] owns and operates, which is designed to promote discussion and tutorials, as well as helping other members with a variety of categories. From 2010 to 2012, users were eligible to receive the Support Feather award for posting 100 times on SF. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] might be considering making the award active again, as the award is currently unavailable.

The OMC award went from 10,000 OMC to 50,000 OMC. The LTC award was increased from 4 LTC to 5 LTC. Both of the awards are equivalent to about $20 USD, although that price may fluctuate.

This translates to about $1,500USD at current market rates. The current price of one OMC is around $0.0014952USD according to [b][url]http://omc-rates.com[/url][/b]. The [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4484259]thread[/url] quickly gained attention and many users left feedback about [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] idea as well as the future of OMC.

Any shoutouts before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] Not at the moment, I'll interrupt you mid interview if I remember.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] So tell us, how did you get introduced to HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] I was looking to join the dark side, so after some searching I found HF and decided it was good enough.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the dark side. How are you enjoying the thug life?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] It has its ups and downs, the drama always keeps me on my toes, especially when one gangster steps on another's territory. I've been doing business on the streets for a while now and know how to play the game, but there's a lot of dope material being swung around the market usually so competing gets annoying. I've stayed active the most in the RAT section since it's where I started my journey but recently I've been expanding to other neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Keepin it real doe. Yeah I see that you're a leader of 2 groups, what's it like up at the top?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] Always. I don't really consider where I am at the top, I've actually realized just how far away from it I am once I was there.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Wow that's deep man. So why did you end up choosing the username Frostix?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] It was an old username that I came up with back in the RS days when I needed a unique username. When I found HF I decided to use it here as well.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] RS, huh? It certainly is unique. What games are you into nowadays?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] RuneScape. Back in the days I played DotA, CS: Source, and Warcraft: III with friends - I then moved on to LoL when it first came out and played semi-competitively but I no longer have time for it anymore unfortunately.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] #PCmasterrace, it's always fun to go back and play with friends. Ever think of switching to console now that next-gen is out?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] PC Forever. No, it's never crossed my mind at all, PC's will always outperform consoles at every point simply due to them having no constraining factors. The only console I ever had was a PlayStation 1 because I didn't know how to build a computer.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's true, you can easily upgrade a PC after buying to suit your needs. So what are some of your hobbies outside of HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] I manage a small IT firm, study ITM with a specialization in Security and Networking, and workout whenever I have the time. Most of my time is consumed between expanding my business, socializing with friends, and school.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Oh that's pretty sweet. Did you create it yourself or are you just a manager?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] I founded it with the help of a close friend. We just got an office in Chicago and are in talks with investors so things have been going well for us recently.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Congrats on that dude. Good luck going forward with it. If you were Omni for a day, what's the first thing you'd do?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] That's a tough one to answer on the spot. The first thing that comes to my mind is give the Hacking Tools and Programs section a moderator, I've discussed this with him before and due to the nature of the section it's unlikely but it could really use one - I feel that it's best to provide some level of quality even to a place as muddy as that since it's quite managable under the hands of an active individual. Then I'd go and teach my kids a few things about computers even if they have no interest because it's a useful skill to have.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, I'd say computers are pretty important to learn about right now, and hopefully the hacking section gets seen to. How do you feel about the group section, with all these new ones popping up? I heard Omni might consider selling one more group for a million OMC.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] I think it's a shame, I miss all the old groups and the prestige behind them - I feel like the new groups are lacking that at the moment. My aim is to turn my groups into what I felt groups were like back then. That's an interesting way to get people into OMC but I feel like after someone actually reaches it the value will drop and people won't have a reason to use it anymore. The currency needs more incentives for use right now.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I was in some of the “prestigious groups\" so I see where you're coming from. Any closing remarks you'd like to say to all the HFers out there?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=992989][color=white][b]Frostix:[/b][/color][/url] Read the help documents, act like yourself, don't worry about reputation or your image, be nice to staff, and don't be afraid of Omni - he's a nice guy when you get to know him, he's just busy often.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009]Raptor.[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to 209th edition of the HF News, today we're here with Raptor. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] Shoutout to all of the other Writ3rs you weirdos\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] They really are a bunch freaks, myself excluded. So tell us what do you do for the writ3rs group?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] I'm one of the editors, so my role is to essentially proof-read a specific post of the edition for any grammatical or formatting errors.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well make sure you clean up this interview if needed. So what was with the recent news team hiatus? Care to inform the readers?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] Initially, Sir was busy due to real life commitments, which is understandable. Following that, a bunch of Writ3rs due to schedule issues or otherwise were unable to complete their tasks by the respective due dates, which put everything behind. We spent over a week playing catch up.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I can personally say it was pretty chaotic and confusing. I read that Sir was busy with school and considered stepping down. Do you think this will ever happen? Who do you feel in the group could rise to the challenge and put out the weekly articles?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] I would say that we could continue the HFNT with a new head editor, but the question is, should we? Sir is the face of the HFNT, and without him, it would feel like a completely different group. Sir makes the HFNT what it is in my eyes.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Not trying to bash any of the other members, but I could only see Froggy rising to the challenge, she's one determine person. So tell me what do you do outside of the forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] I'm heavily into League of Legends at the moment in my spare time. Outside of computer related activities, I attend university in Australia, where I study Commerce.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice! So what makes you pick LoL? I never understood the game and it always looked weird and the games take too long, just my opinion.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] I initially got into that genre of gaming through DotA 2, which is heavily advertised on the popular gaming client Steam. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience as it not only involves individual skill at the game, but also game knowledge and tactical decision making. My friends preferred LoL over DotA, which is a very similar game, just by a different company and more popular, so we all switched over to that.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I've always been a console gamer so I never really understood league, but I do enjoy a little Minecraft every now and then. So you're currently studying commerce, what do you want to do with that? What would be your ideal job?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] I also used to be a console only gamer until I got a gaming laptop. As for my ideal job, that's difficult. I went with a Commerce degree because it's so flexible and allows you to specialise in any number of areas and/or industries. In a perfect world, economist for a Fortune 500 company comes to mind as a near-perfect job.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice. I personally am studying psychology which I could take down numerous routes, but plan on studying criminal justice. So how did you end up coming across Hack Forums?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] Like many others, I came here back when I was involved in the Gamertag market/scene. Hackforums was constantly referenced on other forums as a main market for them, so I checked it out and fell in love with the site's activity. Hackforums, compared to many other forums, is bustling and that appealed to me, since at the time, I was also looking for something I could access during school.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So what keeps you on the forum? Love the for the community, general forum discussion, or Hack Forums addiction?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] At the moment, the League of Legends section and the Writ3r's subforum, however the sections that I frequent change every so often. I only rarely leave those sections, and when I do, it's usually the News and Happenings area.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I'm similar, glued to appraisals and pricing. So how do you feel about the OMC craze sweeping the forum? Rumor has it 1,000,000 OMC for a group might be in the future.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] I think, regardless of the dollar value, OMC is a huge asset to Hackforums. How many other forums have their own cryptocurrency? It helps show just how far along Hackforums is when compared to competing forums, and I think that the currency as a whole is nothing but good for the future of the site. As for the 1m OMC price for a group, upon reading the thread I was intrigued. It would drive prices through the roof, but I can't help but wonder what would happen after the purchase, when Omni has another 1m OMC in his wallet, and the demand drops back to previous levels. I think it's a short-term fix at best to be honest.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I just wish it was easier for members to obtain OMC, I tried finding them and it's damn near impossible. So if you could change one thing about Hack Forums what would it be?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] That's a difficult question. I think I would increase staff action in deal disputes against upgraded users. I understadn it's a grey area, however the deal dispute area is rampant with incredibly sketchy users that last too long on the site in my eyes. I also feel that groups get traded too frequently, I wish they would add a rule adding a minimum time period of 6 months before a bought group can be resold.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I side with you on that, only problem would be keeping them from creating new accounts. Well I think that's all the time I have for this interview. I'd just like to say thanks for taking the time out of your day to be interviewed. Are there any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1453009][color=#EFEFEF][b]Raptor.:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for the interview 630, one final shoutout, this time to the League of Legends section and players. Love you guys.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",

There was a security hole in the iOS 8 which makes it possible for you to play your favourite classic SNES games on your iPhone without the need to jailbreak your iPhone / device. Since Apple does not allow emulators on the Apple App store for copyright reasons, installing third party emulators and other applications that were unapproved is made quite difficult. However, the famous [i]Date Trick[/i] allowed iOS emulator creators to bypass the App store restrictions - allowing them to run their own unofficial emulators on Apple devices such as iPhones and iPads. This hole is patched in the latest upcoming beta update for iOS 8.1. \n\n[color=white][b]SQL Injection Vulnerability in Yahoo! Contributors Network[/b][/color]\nYahoo! Contributors Network is a network of authors that generates content such as photographs, videos and articles seen by over 600 million monthly visitors. This network was vulnerable to a time based blind SQL injection vulnerability. A blind SQL vulnerability could be exploited very easily by hackers to steal users, authors and databases that contain personal and private information. A fairly well known security team lead by [i]Behrouz[/i] reported this flaw to the Yahoo! Security team a few months ago and they responded positively within a month and patched the vulnerability successfully. Subsequently, Yahoo! unfortunately announced their decision to shut down the Yahoo! contributors network due to it's increased popularity, and they removed all of the content which it had contained, except some of the [i]work for fire[/i] content which still remains out there.\n\n[color=white][b]Using Malware to Hack ATM Machines Worldwide \"Tyupkin\"[/b][/color]\nEverybody loves money, especially cyber criminals who try different tricks to specifically target users card information. In the past, these cyber criminals used to use their card skimmers to try and steal credit and debit card numbers. However now the criminals are using a special malware that targets ATM machines to securely withdraw cash without even the need of a credit or debit card. The program being used is dubbed as [i]Tyupkin[/i] and requires physical access to the ATM machine, to boot a 32 bit Windows platform off a CD in order to install the malware. According to researchers, this software has continued to evolve in the recent months, infecting ATM machines in Asia, Europe and America.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9WqJ0sy.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Backoff Malware Presses On[/color][/b]\nFound to be the source of numerous recent business intrusions, a trojan-horse aptly named \"Backoff\" has been running rampant in the business world. Focused on stealing financial data, this trojan has been seen in the inner-workings of big businesses like Dairy Queen and perhaps even Home Depot. Classified as a \"point-of-sale\" malware, this malicious set of code aims to steal financial data [b]before[/b] any security measures that attempt to safeguard said financial data can do anything. The target of many security specialists, and even the Secret Service, this \"Backoff Trojan\" has been highly monitored and more-so the Secret Service has sent out an advisory urging businesses to make sure their systems aren't compromised. More recently, hackers have reportedly targeted businesses such as Dairy Queen and Orange Julius (a partner of Dairy Queen) due to the fact that their systems have been known to be outdated, and not properly secured.\n\n[b][color=white]Shellshock and Awe[/color][/b]\nUnix systems alike are susceptible to one recent and major vulnerability in Bourne Again SHell (BASH), this vulnerability being named \"Shell Shock\", assumed to be named after the \"SHell\" found in \"BASH.\" Many security researches say that this may be one of the biggest vulnerabilities to ever hit unix systems, allowing attackers to break into and control entire systems - with something as simple as one command. Although the attacks differ from system to system, this vulnerability has been said to be on the same severity level, or possibly even higher, than the recent, and more popular \"[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed]Heartbleed Bug[/url].\" Focused mainly on targetting unix system, \"Shell Shock\" aims to use poor coding habits and un-sanitized inputs against server administrators to seize control of systems for other malicious purposes. If you question whether or not any of your systems are vulnerable to this bug, there are many articles online including snippets of code to test your systems.\n\n[b][color=white]SnapSave Intrusion Brought to Light[/color][/b]\n\"SnapChat\" an app widely used by what is guessed to be primarily teens 13-17, allows users to send \"snaps\" or photos, that self-destruct after a set amount of time. Services like SnapSave, seek to avoid the self-destruction of aforesaid photos, no matter how revealing they may be. Said to have originated from SnapSave, a 13-GigaByte (GB) hacked database, full of photos [b]and videos[/b] from over 200,000 users has been brought to the attention of numerous parties. Inside the aforementioned library is said to be chock-full of illegal photos and videos of underage SnapChat users, in some unmentionable situations. Although details of the intrusion aren't too out into the open, it is guessed that the source of the library was from SnapSave. Regardless of the developers of SnapChat pushing the protection of sensitive data, applications like SnapSave are putting pressure on said developers, and are making it apparent that security and protection are two major issues that need to be addressed everywhere.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vn6cLxV.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Halo: The Master Chief Collection launch day multiplayer playlists announced:[/color][/b]\nThe playlists that will be available to gamers on launch day for Halo: The Master Chief Collection were announced last week.

YouTuber \"se7ensins\" located the area called Hypogeum by driving around Mars, particularly The Black Garden, which is also the area of the final campaign mission. The link to a video by se7ensins is embedded below, but be aware that it may contain spoilers to those who have not completed the campaign yet, and it also shows you how to access the unreleased area on Mars. This new area is scheduled to be added as part of the The Dark Below expansion DLC pack at some point in December.\n\n[align=center][sp][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY_KKYQG22c[/yt][/sp][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft Vita Release Date[/color][/b]\nAvailable pretty much on all of the most popular gaming devices, fans who own the PS Vita should expect Minecraft to available for purchase soon. With no release dates for anywhere but Europe, Minecraft Vita edition will be on sale October 15th. You can see a tweet regarding the developers saying the game \"past the final test\" [url=https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/519987042139525120]here[/url], which also includes a very entertaining short video on a world which was created on the Vita. Ever wanted to play Minecraft on the go? Don't have access to your PC/Laptop? Well now you can play Minecraft on the go! Since the release of the original Minecraft game back in 2009, the game has been downloaded more than 100 million times and has made Mojang over $2.5 Billion, including the purchases from PC accounts to consoles. Minecraft now stands as the number 10 game in the UK.\n\n[b][color=white]Down with the Numbers[/color][/b]\nFrom the years of Halo to one of the newest, Halo 4, the first person shooter series has been popular amongst most gaming fans. The developers of the series, Bungie, has announced that the series will try their best to not add numbers in the title names. Halo 5: Guardians will most likely be the last game in the series with a number in the title. Halo bosses say to never expect a Halo 6, but something similar to a Halo: Reach styled name. With that being said, nothing has been released regarding whether Master Chief will or will not be in the newest games in the series. In the current series, there are only four without numbers in them, which are: Halo: Reach (which is a spinoff of ODST), Spartan Assault, and Halo Wars. Bonnie Ross (Current boss of the Halo series) also says that Halo is \"not Final Fantasy\", so the numbers should be dropped.\n\n[b][color=white]Diablo III Double XP Weekend[/color][/b]\nDiablo III will be offering a double XP weekend. This offer is currently only available for game owners on the 360/Xbox One, and PS3/PS4 consoles. Sorry PC gamers. In addition to the experience boost, you will also receive perks that can stack with others. Whether you want to make a new character and start over again or continue leveling up your main account to level 70, this is a great way to boost your Paragon level or get max rank. Depending on the console you own, you will gain an even bigger boost. Those on the new-gen consoles will have the ability to kill more Treasure Goblins, as the spawn rate has been doubled. This is a great opportunity to receive better loot and a higher more chances to visit the Vault. Small tip before attempting to kill Treasure Goblins: Be sure that you have the reacquired items to stay alive and kill them off.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of October 11, 2014:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! - PC, Play Station 3, Xbox 360 - October 14, 2014\n[*]Minecraft - Play Station Vita - October 14, 2014\n[*]Peggle 2 - Play Station 4 - October 14, 2014\n[*]Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition - PC, Play Station 4, Xbox One - October 14, 2014\n[*]The Evil Within - PC, Play Station 3, Play Station 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One - October 14, 2014\n[*]The Walking Dead - Play Station 4, Xbox One - October 14, 2014\n[*]Killer Instinct: Season 2 - Xbox One - October 15, 2014\n[*]F.E.A.R Online - PC - October 17, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[align=center][sp=Gaming Video of the Week][yt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVX7AY_LPNE[/yt][/sp]\n[/align][/spoiler][/align][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/i1QkwoE.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \n\n[b][color=white]Google Glass Can Now Accurately Read Emotions, Age And Gender[/color][/b]\nGoogle Glass has an experimental app that can read a targets age, gender and even their emotional state. The company Fraunhofer IIS has released the app  dubbed Shore™ which uses Google Glasses camera to detect and analyze facial expressions. It is able to determine information of the target the Google Glass user is looking at. The app was written in C++ and was trained by accessing information from a database with over 10000 different faces. Shore™ has a 91.5% chance of being correct about emotions, and 94.3% of detecting a targets gender.\n\n[b][color=white]Windows 9 Preview Shows Improvement Over Predecessor[/color][/b]\nWindows 9 has been rumored since the beginning of the year, and now we are getting pictures and a general idea of what is to come in the new Windows OS. The UI has changed in the start menu combining the old Windows 8 Metro start screen with the old start screen most users are familiar with. There are some changes besides the look, such as the placement of the main folder for your documents, picture etc but overall this change seems to be welcomed by the Windows community. If you got used to the Metro start screen you will be able to keep it the way it is in Windows 8, the start menu change is optional. \n\n[sp=Window 9 Start Screen Preview][img]http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/windows-9-start-menu-technical-preview-640x353.jpg[/img]\n[color=#DCDCDC][size=xx-small]Photo Taken From: http://www.extremetech.com/computing/189976-windows-9-start-menu-makes-video-debut-windows-7-fans-should-finally-be-happy[/size][/color][/sp]\n\n[b][color=white]Google Extends Refund Window For Android Apps[/color][/b]\nAndroid Apps on the Google Play Store used to have a window of 15 minutes to decide if you liked the app after purchase, and Google has extended the time. The time is now set to 2 hours to get a refund for an Android app. The refund option will only work once, so if you purchase an app and get a refund you will now longer be able to get a refund if you purchase it again. The extension went into effect about a month ago, but was just added to Google's official app store policy on their support page.   \n\n[b][color=white]Chrome For Mac Will Be Strictly 64-bit By November[/color][/b]\nThis may be sad news for the people still using an older Mac machine. Google has announced that they have finished the 64-bit version of Chrome for OS X and it will be released in November. Google also stated that there will not be a separate 32-bit version, and users with an old Mac machine will be forced to update their machine if they want to use Chrome. Google believes this move is not going to leave that many people behind since most Mac users have 64-bit systems, but for those who still cherish their first-generation MacBook, it is time to shed some tears and say goodbye. On the bright side, the new 64-bit Chrome should be even faster and more secure than before.\n\n[b][color=white]Vest Translates Sound Into Vibration For The Hearing Impaired[/color][/b]\nEvery day, more gadgets to assist people with disabilities arise. For the hearing impaired, simple tasks like crossing the street can be risky. A new vest aims to put an end to these dangers. Neuroscientist Dr. David Eagleman has begun developing a “vibrating vest” that essentially vibrates when there are noises around you. The vest contains an array of vibration motors which vibrates on the vest specifically to indicate the direction of the sound. The instant tactile feedback the vest provides gives the hearing impaired an ease of mind. Also, Eagleman says that with training, your brain can actually translate the vest’s vibrations, and overall make the feedback from the vest feel more natural. Eagleman stated that he wants to use this vest to not only assist the hearing impaired, but also completely restores their hearing with the vest.\n\n[b][color=white]SanDisk's Extreme Pro SD Card[/color][/b]\nFinally, the people experimenting with 4k video have a way to store their footage. SanDisk’s new Extreme Pro SD card has an insane speed of 95MB/s meaning you can shoot 4k video with no interruptions. Also, the card has 512 GB of storage space, which leaves plenty of room for other important files as well. This card is priced at $800, and there are cheaper variants if you do not need all of that storage space. The other variants include 128 GB or 256 GB of storage space.\n\n[b][color=white]Google Letting College Students Borrow A Chromebook[/color][/b]\nWhen most people go off to college, they buy a laptop themselves to take with for all their assignments. Most people inevitably regret spending more money in the long run, which led Google to start rolling out the Chromebook Lending Library. The Library lets you borrow a Chromebook for a few days, as long as they are on the school Grounds it is yours, which means it can be used to do everything you need, while saving you some cash. The Library is starting its program in Syracuse at Walnut Park and Texas State University next week, and it will go to other colleges in the following weeks. Google did not release how many of these Libraries will exist, so we can only hope there is a decent number.\n\n[b][color=white]FuelWear Shirt Adjusts Heat To Keep You Just Warm Enough[/color][/b]\nThere are plenty of clothing items to keep you warm, sweaters, jackets, long pants, but they aren't the smartest pieces of clothing out there. Seeing as if you get too hot you need to stop wearing the heavy clothing that was keeping you warm in the first place. It is somewhat of an inconvenience, but that should all be changing now thanks to two engineers. The two engineers teamed up to make the FuelWear Flame Base Layer, which is a shirt that is self-heating. All you do is set your desired body temp and the shirt will heat up to reach that, then shut off to keep you from becoming too hot. The shirt itself has already raised its $20,000 goal on IndieGoGo. The campaign is still going on, so if you want to grab one, head on over to [url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fuelwear-the-first-smart-heated-base-layer]this link[/url], you will be able to get it for $150, which is $100 less than the launch price.\n\n[b][color=white]Car Company Known As Local Motors 3D Prints A Car In Six Days[/color][/b]\nWhen someone says 3D printing, you think models, knick-knacks, weapons maybe, but not a car. A company called Local Motors decided that they were going to print a car at IMTS, which is a manufacturer show in Chicago. The car itself would, apart from the engine, battery and suspension, be all 3D printed. The plastic used is carbon-reinforced, and it was produced using a Big Area Additive Manufacturing printer. While this isn't the first 3D printed car, it is the fastest to be done. The last one made was an Urbee 2, which was done in 2500 hours, while this one, known as the Strati, was done in about 144 hours. The car was indeed done for the deadline and went on its first test drive Sunday Sept 14, 2014.While we are still far away from affordable 3D printed cars for all, this is a step in the right direction. If you want to check out the test drive, click [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjIa0uO0BE]here.[/url]\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
