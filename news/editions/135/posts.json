He made it very clear that in-game trading must be kept in the marketplace even though it isn't real life currency. For example, you cannot post threads relating to this in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=185][b]RuneScape[/b][/url] subforum. That should be kept in the [url=http://hackforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=218][b]Virtual Game Items[/b][/url] subforum.

[size=x-small](You'll understand that reference if you look at his username history!)[/size] Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I [i]would[/i] give one to my long-standing friend Huey, but for whatever reasons he has, he's been avoiding this site ever since his account got banned months ago. So I'm here all alone.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awwh :( That's a sad way to start! Anyway, I usually like to begin by asking; what was it that brought you to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] I originally joined back when the Terraria modding scene was hot. A friend of mine I had met was releasing his client over here, and asked me to come check it out, tell people it was cool and what-have-you. Shortly after, I moved over to the Minecraft and Minecraft/Griefing section, and I've stuck ever since.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] That's cool! Like myself, I a lot of your posts are in the coding sections. Were you interested in programming before joining HF? What keeps your interest alive?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I originally started programming waaay, way back when Minecraft classic servers where the real deal, so I was programming commands and mods to the server software in C#. I then transitioned to writing mods for Terraria, which led to meeting my friend which brought me here.\nWhat keeps my interest alive? I'd say a sort of passion to learn, to expand what I know. If I don't know how to do something, or it's not easy, I'll find out how to do it, write up a wrapper/app to make it easier, and throw it on my GitHub.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] And what's the big picture here? I mean, what do you see yourself doing in the future, with this in mind?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] Well, my end goal is to work at somewhere like Google. I know some people who work there, and a few weeks ago, a recruiter emailed me, so I'm obviously on the radar. I suppose I'll take something like a Computer Science or Computer Engineering degree, see where that takes me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] What do you like to do for fun? ;D\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] In my spare time I find and write 0days in software. I'm currently sitting on one with some government enterprise level software. Can't disclose details for obvious reasons, but it's a serious fucking exploit. I also go camping with my school friends and girlfriend.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Funny, in all this time that I've known you, I still don't know where you are! Where you from, bud? How is it over there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] I'm from a little suburb in the middle of nowhere in Australia; nearest to Sydney, I suppose.\nIt's pretty good, the weather is fairly crazy though. Freezing cold and rainy one day, blistering heat the next.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Pfft, you can't complain about the weather and live in Australia! That's just sad :( Do you see yourself still frequenting HF in, let's say, 2 years time?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] It's fairly likely. It gives me something to do in spare time I have when I'm not in the mood to program.\nI also secretly love skidding code from the PHP section, but you knew that already.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I still think that you should change your name back ;) What's with the new name, anyway? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] I felt like PigBacon wasn't mature enough, really. It originally started back when I started Minecraft in 2011, but after a while I just went for something which I felt was better.\nName changes are a one way trip, buddy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Pfft. CarrotMilk fo' lyf son! So, before we conclude, I'd like to ask: What do you think is the future of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] I can see it going one of two ways. The first (and what I presume will happen) way is that HF will continue to get an influx of newbies weekly, each asking \"how 2 hack faceb00k passwrds wit backtrack 5r3\", and the other would be people just silently disregard those posts, and they move their low quality posts elsewhere, cleaning up (at least) the sections I frequently see that crap in.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] I definitely hope it's the latter! I mean, you're always going to get new people coming in and asking these silly sort of questions, but as time progresses, those \"noobs\" eventually learn more and more (at least some do, anyway!)\nI'd like to thank you a ton for the interview. Any last words to conclude? ^.^\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=897819][color=white][b]plausibility:[/b][/color][/url] \"640k ought to be enough for anybody\" - Bill Gates.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125]#Sultan[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] For this edition of the HF News, I will be interviewing #Sultan!

Hacking!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Have you learned anything since you joined? If so, please tell me about that!\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125][color=white][b]#Sultan:[/b][/color][/url] I have learned so much, I'v learned how to use Grammar correctly, I'v learned about coding, but my biggest has to be servers/stresser. As I said before I came looking for them, now I make & Design them... Well at least I'm learning how to Design them, make them look good, the web pages etc...\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] What are your current opinions the groups you are in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125][color=white][b]#Sultan:[/b][/color][/url] Empire: To be honest, it was my first REAL group due to the fact of anyone could get into Eminence, everyone in the group are so nice to each other, we get along so well, It's honestly like one big happy family, I love it!\nVoid: Can't say much about Void, I can say it's full of incredibly intellectual Member, It's usually a more serious scene in there, but we can have a laugh here and there.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] How did you chose the username #Sultan and why? Is there an idea behind it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125][color=white][b]#Sultan:[/b][/color][/url] The username Sultan; well it comes from two ideas, one meaning was from my gaming past; the SultanRS was a car in the Video Game 'GTA' or Grand Theft Auto. I used to be quite popular online due to the mods I used to make.\nThe other idea was that it ment King in the Arabic, I get PM's everyday from Arabic people asking me where I come from.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] I see you're running a stresser here on HF. What are your opinions on the server stress business?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125][color=white][b]#Sultan:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed I do.\nWell let me start by saying they can make A LOT of money if you know how to market them right, just buying a sticky for your thread can make a HUGE differnce.\nI'm not going to comment on any other stresser on the Market now, but people can make mad money by running one!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] What is your opinion on HF currently? Has it changed? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125][color=white][b]#Sultan:[/b][/color][/url] I love it, It's a great place.\nThere always seems to be changes. I seem to have noticed massives changes in the Groups Section. That's about it though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Enough about the internet for now! Do you do anything IRL? Sports, hobbies, etc.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1364125][color=white][b]#Sultan:[/b][/color][/url] I do, for one I do 'land based skills' which is setup by a college near me, basically It's a bunch of mixed skills, from chopping down trees, to driving a tractor around a park. Haha!\nI also do Football & Rugby. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1050193][color=#91FF00][b]Connected:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for allowing me to interview you!

      "message": "[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2mZem[/img][/align]\n[b][color=white]Updates on [i]Minecraft Realms[/i][/color][/b]\nMojang has released official information on the previously unannounced [i]Minecraft Realms[/i]. They stated that [i]Realms[/i] is currently in alpha, saying \"A select group of players now have access to the Minecraft Realms limited alpha test. Minecraft Realms is a service designed to let players play on a server together with minimal setup, and will be available to the public later this year\". We already knew that [i]Realms[/i] is a server type feature and Mojang has now elaborated on that; it will be a subscription service paid for by the host. One subscription will host a single server and the host can whitelist players as they wish; this indicates that the individual realms will typically be considerably smaller than public servers which can hold hundreds or even thousands of players at a time. [i]Realms[/i] was created as an easy way for someone to play on a reliably hosted server with friends without having to worry about backend issues; this can, however, be a downside considering the fact that mods and plugins will likely be unavailable to [i]Realms[/i] subscribers. Mojang also announced [i]Pocket Realms[/i], which will be the first and only way to host a non LAN server on a mobile device.

It was in response to shots being fired at Israeli soldiers from Syria. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman, explained Israeli troops  \"destroyed a Syrian machine gun nest that fired twice in the last 24 hours on Israeli patrols operating to safeguard the border.\" This isn't the first time such a violent event has transpired. Syrian shots have been fired into Israeli on multiple occasions, and Israeli has also returned the gesture on a number of occasions. Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner of Israeli stated,  \"Our understanding is that it wasn't stray fire.\" He also stated that the Israeli soldiers \"responded with accurate fire toward the Syrian post from which they were fired on.\"\n\n[b][color=white] North Korea's Great Human Rights[/color][/b]\nIn response to the UN's suspicion of human rights abuse in North Korea, the state has claimed they have one of the best human rights systems in the world. However, many reports have gone to the UN explaining that the state has engaged in a large amount of slavery, abduction, murder, and other inhumane acts. As a result of The United Nations Human Rights Council creating a draft resolution on the matter, So Se Pyong, a North Korean representative, stated that it \"is no more than an instrument that serves the political purposes of the hostile forces in their attempt to discredit the image of the DPRK.\" He went on to say that the citizens of North Korea are \"happy with pride and honor that they have one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Russian Tycoon Boris Berezovsky Dies[/color][/b]\nBoris Berezovsky, an exiled Russian tycoon, was discovered dead in London. He died at the age of 67 around his home. The police said they are currently investigating the death that is unexplained. Police have investigated the man's property where the death occurred, and Supt. Stuart Greenfield remarked, \"I would like to reassure residents that we are confident there is no risk to the wider community.\" He also said that, \"The property is part of a large estate so a number of roads are closed off at the moment and will remain so for the time being.\" Boris had harshly criticized Putin's government in the past, and he was granted political asylum in Britain.\n\n[b][color=white]North Ireland Police Defuse Car Bomb[/color][/b]\nNorthern Irish officials have defused a car bomb that was located near the area where leaders will meet at the G8 summit later this year. The police suspect that the bomb was going to target a nearby police station. District Commander Pauline Shields publicly stated, \"Once again our community has been disrupted and the lives of residents put at risk by an element intent on causing loss of life and disruption.\" Shields also remarked, \"The people responsible for this have no regard for the lives of anyone in our community. It is fortunate that no-one was killed or seriously injured as a result of this reckless act.\" The attempted bombing is suspected to be the actions of militant nationalists despite the cease-fire agreements.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2mZfs[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nApple has recently acquired a service called \"WiFiSlam\", which is a company that uses WiFi strength signals to locate devices indoors. Little has been said about the feature from Apple, but the purchased cost the company nearly $20 Million. \nDevelopers for Apple have already been notified, but the public is just now hearing word of changes that will happen soon. Apple has told developers that on May 1st of this year, they will not except an application that snags an iDevice's UDID. An iDevice's UDID is a 40 digit code that is unique to all iDevices, that applications use to manage a device's online data for the specific device. Rather than snagging the UDID in the background, this new change will force developers to make users sign into an account rather than use a specific ID automatically. \nA bug has also been found with Apple's iCloud/Apple account system that allows the attacker to reset user's passwords with only their name and date of birth. Apple has implemented a two step security feature to prevent this attack. \n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nAs previously mentioned, Windows Blue is said to be the next Windows based OS; well, there has been a leak found online. Windows Blue should make its first appearance in the next few months, which will come for computers, tablets, phones, servers, and other Windows services. Blue is said to come with the ability to snap applications to each other, up to four alongside each other. It will come loaded with Internet Explorer 11, along with touch gestures used to access applications, and other system settings.\n\n[color=white][b]Google[/b][/color]\nAs any Android fan knows, Google has been working on a project known as [url=http://www.google.com/glass]Google Glass[/url]. Google Glass being, well, simply 'smart glass'. Recently Google has patented an eye piece patent that will be used with the Google Glass project. After a year, the patent has finally been approved, protecting such technology from being copied. The exact patent number is [url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220130070338%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20130070338&RS=DN/20130070338]case 20130070338[/url]. This will surely bring change to the way Android users see things.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2mZfE[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Victoria Beckham to Never Sing Again on Stage[/b][/color]\nEx-Spice Girls singer Victoria Beckham has now announced that she has no intentions to sing with her former group \"The Spice Girls\". Currently happily married to English footballing legend David Beckham, she is the mother of four children and runs a successful fashion business. Victoria has recently announced that she has purchased more retail space in the UK to cater for her rapidly growing company. Her decision has come soon after relocating back to the UK since David signed to French soccer team Paris Saint-Germain. It has been reported hat the rest of the band, which is comprised of Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm and Melanie Brown, are aware of Victoria's announcement and are swiftly looking for a replacement. \"The girls, particularly Geri, think there is so much more that they can achieve, and they know that their fans still want to see them perform,\" a source revealed. The new band member will supposedly be dubbed \"Wannabe Spice\" upon joining the group.\n\n[color=white][b]Ben Howard announces his new European tour dates[/b][/color]\nDouble Brit Award winner Ben Howard has announced the details of his upcoming European tour which has been scheduled to take place in the summer.

After topping the charts with the classic 'Welcome To The Black Parade' in 2006, they became one of the top alternative music bands, but after an emotional statement today they declared the end of their adventure together. \"We've gotten to go places we never knew we would. We've been able to see and experience things we never imagined possible. We've shared the stage with people we admire, people we look up to, and best of all, our friends. And now, like all great things, it has come time for it to end,\" the group announced. They then went on to thank all of their fans for their endless support over the last few years: \"Thanks for all of your support, and for being part of the adventure.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuZE_IRwLNI[/yt]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2mZg0[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nReligion. Sometimes, it just baffles me. The sheer fact that people can blindly follow where there is no clear path, just blows my mind. It seems as though logic has no place within these types of people, and I just can't understand it. Now, I'm not dissing religion, as there are perfectly acceptable forms of religion, but sometimes... it just gets out of hand. When religion has become more about power over others rather than bettering yourself and those around you, I just don't have a place in it. Hopefully the future will hold a realization for today's youth, that we need to truly examine all possibilities when it comes to life.",

      "message": "[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2mZgt[/img][/align]\n\n\"What do you think of the new collection of forums under the 'Personal Life' category?\"\n\n[i]\"I believe adding the \"Personal Life\" section was a long time coming. Many \nusers were posting health questions, including workout strategies and diet \nsuggestions, so in came \"Health Wise\". Another category which should be \npopular is \"Pet Peeve\" (don't let the name fool you) this sub-forum deals \nstrictly with our pets, which not surprisingly, many of us have. Also coming \ninto existence is \"Education Nation\" which focuses on school help/tutoring. \nAs expected \"Innuendo\" was merged into this new section, where it belongs. \nI expect all 4 to continue staying active as HF grows as a community. So in \nconclusion I would say the \"Personal Life\" addition was a great choice and \nI look forward to helping as much as I can, stay HQ<3.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=721613][i]-Derrick Rose[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I'm pretty happy to see a Personal Life section, even though \nI rarely post in it. Mostly I just lurk around that section cause I don't know \nwhat to say. I have to say that at least there are more HQ posts in there \nthan the public lounge. Omni made a good idea in adding that, and it was \nquite a surprise when I first saw it with 0 threads and unable to view anything, \nfew hours later 22,236 threads in it, I mean like, wow o.o Now hopefully, with \nthe more specific sections unlike the lounge, people can post specific things \nother than asking general questions. I am glad to see this was added, pretty \nsmart idea.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1554535][i]-Voyager ツ[/i][/url][/align]\n\n[i]\"The integration of a 'Personal Life' category into HF is a wonderful idea. It \nsuccessfully transposes all the threads that belonged on Omniscient's other site, \n'www.supportforums.net' to a much larger audience. This move also drastically \nlimits the number of threads in the Sports World (For Health Wise) regarding \npersonal health, and not actual sports. The same can be said for SRPP and \nEducation Nation. I like having as many sections as possible, so long as they \nprovide some value to the community by making it clear where certain threads \nshould go. 'Personal Life' really does that, and I believe it was an excellent \naddition to the forum. Next up, I'd love to see a subsection to that subforum \ndiscussing rants, or things people just need to get off their chests, but don't \nwant to post in the lounge for fear of being trolled / flamed.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=898803][i]-Valderino[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right][i]\"I think the new section of forums will be very useful to the \norganization of posts put in the lounge. I have been always wanting to make a \nthread detailing my weight loss in the past two months, but would not want to \nput it in the lounge because of obvious reasons, but this gave me a place where \ntrolls would not be abundant, and would be exterminated quickly if shown. I really \nlike the amount of people posting about their efforts, and problems in the Health \nSection, I love looking at people's pets in the Pet Peeve section, and like being \nhelpful in the Education Nation section. In addition to the new three sections, I \nfind it very good they moved the innuendo section, as it was also ridden with trolls, \nI think the separation from the lounge will deter them. Overall, all three of the \nnew forums were asked for, and Omni listened. I just wish Omni would ban \ndrug discussions.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1125749][i]-Kray[/i][/url][/align]\n\nThe topic for next week is \"What do you think of the recent changes?
