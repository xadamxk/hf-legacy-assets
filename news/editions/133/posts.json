Its focus was that of blackhat and hacking related means. In the past couple of months, Root has had quite a lot of negative attention. Site owner, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], has also released that Root leaders have dox'd members, participated in DDoSing, swating, stealing accounts, and have committed other forms of harassment. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] also announced that leadership has also toyed with site permissions, threatened staff, and other malicious activity. So action has been taken. The group is closed and all leadership accounts are closed as well. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has also  closed all ex-Root leaders, which include [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1448109][color=black][b]RyanC[/b][/color][/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1285731][color=black][b]Starfall[/b][/color][/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=559352][color=black][b]Castle Bravo[/b][/color][/url]. On top of that, an announcement was made saying that anyone helping those members in any way possible, will have their account treated the same way. \"I will close your account and you can just fuck off.\" You may read more about it by [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3306215]clicking here[/url].\r\n\n[color=white][b]Official Group 143 Completely Paid Off[/b][/color]\r\nA massive congratulations to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]Cody‍[/b][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1263952][b]Daisy[/b][/url]. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] announced on twitter that 143 has now been completely paid off. The group is based on emotional support and love ♥. 143 is an invite only group and doesn't hold application threads or buy-ins. Once again, a big congratulations to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544][b]Cody‍[/b][/url] and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1263952][b]Daisy[/b][/url]. For those who don't know, 143 stands for I love you: one letter in \"I,\" four letters in \"Love,\" and three letters in \"You.\" \r\n\n[color=white][b]Official Group Beacon - Sold[/b][/color]\r\nBeacon, previously owned by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][b]Dan.[/b][/url], has now been sold to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/url]. It's not clear what [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/url] plans to do with Beacon, but we do know he has great things in store for his purchase. The group was based on the popular game \"Minecraft,\" and had its own Minecraft server called \"Planet Beacon.\" We are not too sure why [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1011113][b]Dan.[/b][/url] decided to sell the group, but we assume that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1341017][b]Plaтiпuм[/b][/url]'s offer was too tantalizing to pass on.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Search Bar Added to the Hack Forums Header[/b][/color]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has added a search bar function to the top, left side of the Hack Forums header.

Bonjour! Today, for the 133rd edition of the Hack Forums news, we are joined by the one and only [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445]ManDoR[/url]! Before we begin, would you like to make any shoutouts?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] Salut! Yep, first I would like to make a shoutout for you, because you made me enter this amazing group which is The Alliance. I would like to make one for Dave85 too, he's a really nice guy and I like speaking with him via PM. Then of course for every members that are actives in the PHP section (PUTS, fobber, iBones, ...). And last, but not least, to every members of TA, you're amazing guys.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome, that's great! So, I usually like to ask this to all my interviewees; what was it that first brought you to HF?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] I was playing this game called Counter Strike: Source, and I liked the idea to use the cfg files to make some menus and customize my game. So I searched on google and found this website. Then one thing leading another I started coding batch, then vb.net but I really didn't liked that so I tried PHP, and I'm still in love!\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] As the HF community grows, it seems to attract more and more people whose native language isn't English. Did you find that at all intimidating when you joined? I mean, do you feel as if English not being your first language held you back at all?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] Well, at the beginning yes. This is one of the reasons I wasn't posting as mush as I would liked. I was like, you know saying in every posts \"sorry for my bad English\", and I was really thinking nobody was actually understanding what I was saying. I think this applies to every new members who doesn't speak English fluently. But this is past. As everybody evolve, I'm not experiencing any problems with speaking English anymore, even if I know I'm making some mistakes sometimes.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Do you think that in joining HF, your English skills have improved drastically? That can be a huge benefit to anyone joining any online community, but with HF being so big, it's bound to attract people from a variety of countries.\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, absolutly. The major benefit from being part of the HF community is the fact that my vocabulary has increased dramatically. In addition, I can ask for help when I don't know if I misspelled a word, or if I made a mistake in a sentence ect. As english is one of the most spoken language in the world (if it isn't the most), learning english while speaking about subjects that we like to speak about is a great advantage, and make it easier and more friendly. This isn't the same way as learning english in classes.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] Mhmm, definitely. What do you think has been the biggest influence on you during your time here?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] The PHP dev section. It made me learn it more in depth. Without this section, I think I would have switched to another language, such as C or Java. When I learnt the basics of PHP, it was to make a link between a desktop app and my server, I wasn't planning on staying on it. I really enjoy debating in this section. It's full of good and smart guys. I could say TA too, because it opens my mind to the other languages.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] A lot of people come to HF for the coding sections. What is it in programming that keeps your interest?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] The logical thing for sure. Life is made of opportunity, hope and so on. Programming is made of logic. There is everytime a way to make something (even if it can be messy sometimes), to achieve a goal. Actually I like the automating tasks too. Making user's life easier is a great feeling. Having challenges makes it more enjoyable too. My points could seem a bit messy, but there are so many I can think of it right now that I can't order them.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] What do you hope to do after your studies? As in, career-wise?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] I would love to work as an artificial intelligence ingeneer. I like thinking that a computer could have a mind and think by itself (see that I don't consider a computer as a person even if it has a \"mind\"). By AI, I mean some intelligence that could help people in their life, I'm not talking about some AI in video games. Creating intelligence is, in my mind, one of the best challenge a developer could give to himself. Making the computer understand what we are saying, making it able to learn by itself ect. Sounds amazing isn't it?\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] It really does seem incomprehensible; teaching a \"machine\" to be human. One last question: what do you think the future of Hack Forums is?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] I won't try to make a machine being a human. I want to make a machine able to understand and interact with the human world. \r\nTo answer your question, I think HF still have a lot of potential for its future. It still is the first hacking forum, and has an incredible amount of skilled users. The only thing that could make it flow is technical issues. Omni has a lot of work to make HF bug free (I'm not denigrating his work, I know he's working hard). I'm talking about community problems because every staff members also do an amazing work.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=190854][color=#FFA500][b]CarrotMilk:[/b][/color][/url] That's great - thank your for the interview! Any last words before I depart? <3\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=330445][color=white][b]ManDoR:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for your time and your interest, you've been a great interviewers, and this has been a pleasure talking with you about serious things <3 \r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337]Tibit[/url][/font][/size][Spoiler=]\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: For the 133rd Edition of the Hack Forum's New's, we have found a survivor of the recent catastrophe!

But to the point, everyone was dumbfounded when they had discovered you had been Rep Fucked earlier this week. Would you mind shining some light on this event?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: Well I wasn't just rep fucked or else it wouldn't really have mattered. I was in class during most of the events of that day and in IRC with root members and many other HF members. Shortly after I got home later in the evening I noticed I couldn't post for some reason. When I went to view my UserCP I saw that I had been rep fucked as well and my signature permanently removed as well as posting priveliges permanently removed. I sent Omni a message right away asking what had happened. As soon as I PM'd him he had a PM titled \"RyanC\" and told me the following: \r\n\n\"You think I'm gonna put up with that shit? You dun goofed. I'm gonna end your HF career. You fucking pissed me off good now.\"\r\n\nI sent him a reply asking what he was referring to and wondering what was going on. He took awhile to reply as he was closing and banning accounts like crazy along with writing up a thread about the situation with root. He then put a -10 on me stating that anyone who rep'd me would be rep fucked as well then rep fucked me again. \r\n\nOnce I had talked with Omni more to find out what he was talking about he removed the limitations on my account and the -10. The whole situation happened so fast when he got on that he acted quick on many of his actions before knowing the full situation.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]:  Sounds like quite a mess. Many were surprised to see the craziness that unfolded that day. What do you think will come of root now that everyone involved was banned?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: I was quite a day full of interesting events. I personally think root will go back to what they were before. They've always been a group of people who use IRC heavily. They were not dependant on HF, their sub-forum showed that. They were more active in the public sections than their own sub-forum, but most active in their IRC. Many of them are very talented individuals. I've enjoyed talking with a few of them and being in their IRC a few times. They may make new accounts and still visit or they may just move on from Hackforums, only they can decide what they do in the future.\r\n\nThe one that should be worried is Hawkode as he paid for ownership of root shortly before the chaos began, as soon as the payment cleared they went to work getting the group in trouble while Hawkode slept. Staff interviened then Omni deleted the group and even threatened to close Hawkode's account believing the joke that Castle Bravo posted about RyanC owning it with Hawkode as partners. At the time of this interview Hawkode still doesn't have a group and Omni hasn't stated publicly anything other than the group is gone for good. I believe Omni will give him a group as he already made the payments, but I'm not completely sure, I'm sure we'll find out soon.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Things don't seem to be going well for anyone involved. Hopefully Omni understands Hawkode's dilema and grants him a group as he paid for it. Has Omni talked to you about any of this since or apologized?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: I order stickies quite often for many things relating to projects, sales, my group, contests, giveaways, etc. I've got a few new products being released on other sites at the moment, unsure if HF would be a good marketplace for them or not, may release 1-2 more on HF this month. For the Empire I plan on having the Userbar and Forum Icon changed this week along with working on continuing the momentum within the group to continue expanding what we do on the site.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: You certainly keep yourself busy it seems. With all these projects and products being sold, what do you do with all the money made?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: I am always busy as you and those who talk with me know. I have an exremely busy personal and work life, HF is more of a hobby. Every cent I make on HF goes back to the community in form of donations, giveaways, contests, handouts, etc or to be reinvested in marketing or enhancing each product.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: You always seem to give back your fair share to the forums. And you have been a member for years, are you planning on a feedback thread anytime soon? Or do you plan on waiting until a specific moment to release one?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: As you've seen my feedback thread is under development in The Empire sub-forum. I plan on releasing it this weekend, possibly before this interview is on the news, if not then sometime early in the week. Hopefully before my birthday on the 17th of this month.\r\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=#1E90FF][b]xadamxk[/b][/color][/url]: Since I have to write the Tech News as well, I will be cutting this interview short. Thank you for the letting me give this interview, and I hope you have a Happy Birthday Tibit. Before we end this, do you have any final comments you would like to tell the Hack Forums community?\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651337][color=white][b]Tibit[/b][/color][/url]: Nope, that should cover it until my feedback thread is finished. Have a nice evening mate.\r\n[/Spoiler]",

Redstone wizards will rejoice at the impressive changelog, which includes TNT minecarts, hoppers, droppers, daylight sensors, trapped chests, weighted pressure plates, nether quartz and [i]much, much[/i] more. Due to its complexity, the Redstone update is better experienced than explained, however, there are a few exciting new gadgets which are mentionable: firstly, there's the daylight sensor, which sends a pulse to any redstone wiring hooked up to it while there is direct contact with sunlight. Then there's the hopper, which is almost like a tekkit pipe: it sends blocks from one functional block to another; for example, you could send cooked meat from a furnace straight to a chest. A few new blocks, such as redstone blocks and nether quartz blocks were added. Redstone blocks can send redstone pulses and nether quartz blocks are aesthetic, pure white blocks which are similar in appearance to marble. Trapped chests send a pulse when opened and TNT minecarts explode when they reach an activator minecart.

Although it's a PvP-Factions server, it typically has over 150 players on at a time, making the PvP-factions experience not as immersive, due to the massive amount of players. What's best about the server is the multiple, challenging, parkour courses, which are easily accessible through a number of warps. The parkour courses range from easy to hard, with a few fun courses in between. In total there are six parkour courses.

The senior user interface designer, [url=https://twitter.com/drcandland/status/309410053465702401]David Candland[/url], posted a tweet confirming that they are [url=http://www.bungie.net/en-us/View/bungie/userresearch/index]in need of beta testers.[/url] The game is known to be a first-person shooter with sci-fi elements. Rumors for Playstation devices have been confirmed, along with the formally-stuck Xbox, in which Bungie is currently in the standing ovation for in the Halo series. It will hit current generation consoles and next generation consoles. \n\n[color=white][b]The Walking Dead - Season Two.[/b][/color]\nThe episode release game of \"The Walking Dead - Season Two\" has been announced to verge in the third quarter of 2013. The discussion has included emphasis, quote \"The current estimated release window for Season Two of The Walking Dead is for Fall of 'this' year (2013), and not 'next' year (2014) as has been reported after a recent interview. We apologize for any confusion and thank you and all of our fans for your continued excitement for the series!\" Game reviews of the first season were commendable, so the second season looks bright. It's on its way.\n\n[color=white][b]SimCity release a [i]Disaster[/i].[/b][/color]\nThe release of SimCity, a new game by Electronic Arts (A.K.A. EA), came out with severe server issues - disallowing customers from playing, installing the game, and even refusing refunds for the massive insanity the game has caused since release. There have also been [url=http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9338300.page#27460807][i]warning[/i] bans to buyers.[/url] Read a buyer's experience posted originally on the SimCity forum, \"It's kind of hard to be nice about it when your support system is not practical. I just waited through the web chat for 90 min, then the guy says no refund but to call this # *. So I Call it. My estimated time on hold is 3478 minutes. Do you really expect someone to be nice if they have to wait 2 and half days just to get help?\" EA's response was to combine \"everything [they] have\" to fix the issues. It has also been said that EA is offering a free game of choice for anyone who has bought SimCity, as a gesture of good faith.\n\n[color=white][b]Tuesday Releases - March 12th[/b][/color]\n(Sequel) [u]Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm[/u] - PC/Mac\n(Prequel) [u]God of War: Ascension[/u] - PS3\n(Sequel) [u]Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2[/u] - X360/PS3/PC \n(Expansion) [u]Dead Space 3: Awakened[/u] - X360/PS3/PC\n(Sequel) [u]Darkstalkers Resurrection[/u] - X360/PS3\n\n[u]Discussion[/u]\n[color=white][b]Virtual Reality Gaming[/b][/color]\nDiscussion emerged on the Oculus Rift, a [url=http://www.oculusvr.com/]virtual reality headset[/url], which may be the start of innovation in gaming.

The late President died at the age of 58. The political scene in the nation is now on shaky ground, as opposing forces are rallying against the populist party. It is also bringing tension to popular foreign governments, such as Bolivia. The entire economy is in a mess. For example, Lisbeth Aulasr was reported as stating, \"I celebrate his death, because he did a lot of harm to Venezuela, he handed the country to Cubans, he left behind crime, the hospitals are collapsed,\" said housewife Lisbeth Aulasr. The Defense Minister, Admiral Diego Molero, reassured people by saying the military would stay faithful to the country's constitution.\n\n[color=white][b]North Korean Tensions Rise[/b][/color]\nNot only has North Korea done away with the armistice with Washington, but has also threatened the US with a nuclear attack. While analyzing all of the recent events surrounding North Korea, a former South Korean foreign minister was quoted in a magazine as saying, \"I find this completely unacceptable and it is also a challenge for the international community...there is a serious humanitarian crisis in North Korea. Many people suffer from malnutrition.\" North Korea also denied a U.N. Security Council resolution to halt the nuclear weapons program. Focus has also shifted somewhat to Iran's nuclear program and having talks with the international community.\n\n[color=white][b]33 Year Missing Soviet Soldier Found[/b][/color]\nA former Soviet Union soldier, who has been missing for the last 33 years, has been discovered alive and well. He currently lives in the Herat Province in western Afghanistan and has a job as a traditional healer. Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee, an organization that tracks down missing former Soviet soldiers, are the ones who tracked down the \"missing\" soldier. \"He received a heavy wound to the head in the course of a battle in (Shandand) district in September 1980 when he was picked up by local residents...he now leads a semi-nomadic life with the people who sheltered him.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Miss Russia Speaks Against Pussy Riot Sentence[/b][/color]\nThis year's Miss Russia, Elmira Abdrazakova, has expressed publicly that the sentence given to the Pussy Riot band members was too heavy of a sentence. Jail terms were handed down to three Pussy Riot members for holding an anti-religious performance in Moscow's Russian Orthodox Cathedral. Elmira Abdrazakova remarked, \"I've graduated from a Sunday school and a place of worship for me is something sacred...but still, their punishment is too harsh,\" on the Russkaya Sluzhba Novostei radio station. In the past, Western pop stars such as Madonna have also spoken out against the sentences given. This article wouldn't be complete without a picture of the beautiful Miss Russia, so here you go: http://goo.gl/iJ7yF\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2fd05[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Apple[/b][/color]\nAs any Apple fan-boy (or girl) knows, Apple is using Samsung when it comes to their iDevice hardware. Well, for the past few months, Intel and Apple have talked about using Intel-based chips for the iDevice processors, yet neither company have come to an agreement. Intel has announced that they will be working with a new major customer in 2013, the exact company is unknown, though. Leaving Apple fans in the shadows. \nFor the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, a radio has yet to be added to iDevices. Making internet streaming the only option for radio use. Apple had planned to release a feature called the \"iRadio\" to users by the start of this year, however, iOS6's features and bug fixes have stalled the company. Now, Apple says the release of the iRadio feature will likely be released by this summer and will be a paid feature. \n\n[color=white][b]Samsung[/b][/color]\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 will be announced later next week, but until then, rumors are spreading. With accounts of leaked images and information, users have concluded that the S4 will be a drastic upgrade compared to the S3. With a whomping 1.8 Ghz quad-core processor, 5-inch HD display, 2Gs of RAM, and 13 Megapixel rear facing camera, the rumored Galaxy S4 will surely be an upgrade for all Android users. If you want to read more about what users think Samsung will include in the new phone, you can read about it [url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-57572852-251/what-the-galaxy-s4-needs/]here[/url].

There are rumors spreading that all retail Windows devices will come with a special offer soon, including discounts and a free copy of Microsoft Office 2013. Along with the computers themselves, Windows 8 is said to drop in price for all touch screen devices, which will surely raise sales. Since Windows 8 does not work for smaller Windows-based tablets, there is a rumored \"Windows Blue,\" that will be released soon to function on Windows devices with a 7 to 8 inch screen.\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2fd0u[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Britney Spears to avoid \"things spiraling out of control again\"[/b][/color]\nBritney Spears has said that she wants to be taken seriously again in her career after she split up from Jason Trawick. There were initially fears that she would once again have a breakdown, like she did in 2008. Following the break up, Britney began to look disheveled as if she no longer cared about her appearance, with her hair tangled and messy and clothes dirty and crumpled. Her mother told her that she needed to put more effort into how she looked and she clearly acted upon this advice; she was seen at the beach with newly dyed brown hair and an overall polished up look. \"Britney has listened to her mum's advice. She really wants to be taken seriously in her career and not let things spiral out of control again\" an insider told Heat magazine. \"All of her affairs are handled by either her lawyers or by her dad Jamie. Changing her hair colour may seem trivial, but it's the one thing she has total say over.\"\n\n[color=white][b]Liam Hemsworth flies to Australia - away from Miley Cyrus[/b][/color]\nMiley Cyrus' fiancé, Liam Hemsworth, has flown off to Australia to take a break from the recently troubled relationship. The 20-year-old singer-and-actress and the 23-year-old actor got engaged in June of 2012 after first meeting on the set of a love film, back in 2009. It has been speculated that they have reached a rough patch with concerns that they may end up splitting up, but for now, Miley has confirmed they will be staying together for the time being, despite taking her ring off to \"make him [Liam] mad.\" Apparently, Liam would rather spend time with his brother Chris Hemsworth than his wife-to-be, at the moment. Miley is adamant all of these rumors are not true and she still wants to go ahead with the wedding.\n\n[color=white][b]Justin Bieber fights with mother over new book cover plans[/b][/color]\nJustin Bieber has gotten into a massive fight, involving screaming and shouting, with his mother, Pattie Mallette, over the ideas for her front cover of her new book. The publisher of the book wanted a picture of Justin Bieber on the front to increase sales, however, the star was not made aware of this decision and the deal was made without his consent. When his mother had attempted to approach him over the issue, he reportedly got extremely annoyed and immediately began to shout at Pattie, who in turn started to scream back. An insider reported: \"When things with her book finally started coming to fruition, she approached him about being on the cover and he threw a massive fit. Justin felt like it was unfair to him. \"Despite the ferocious argument that took place, an agreement between the two was eventually formed which left both sides happy enough. Finally, much closer to the release of the book, he agreed to do a a conference for the big outlets in order to promote it, but he reported that it ended up being extremely uncomfortable and awkward.\n\n[align=center][color=white][b]Music Video of the Week[/b][/color]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxxstCcJlsc[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://puu.sh/2fd0D[/img][/align]\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nGot it all out! Looking pretty good, too.\n\nIt's been a while since I've talked about anything meaningful here. So, I'd like to try to do that again. For one, I'd like to comment about how important money is in our society. Our lives are literally driven, perpetuated, and created by money. One could go so far as to say the meaning of life is now money. Without money, one can't survive, happily, at least. It's beyond the point of a factor of our daily lives, it is our daily lives. Those who go to school, they go to school to get a job, for... more MONEY! Those who work, are doing it for money. Sure, there are a few exceptions, but just be aware of the fact that money is integral in our society.",
