To read any older editions of the HF News, please go [url=http://bitly.com/1FnhESq]here[/url].[/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Headlines.png[/IMG][/align]\n[align=center][IMG]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Cooligan.png[/IMG][/align]\n\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]The Issue of Morchid's Account[/b][/color]\nOn January 23rd, 2016 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=#383838][b]Morchid's[/b][/color][/url] account went rampant. Throughout the day there were many spam posts made, threads moved and closed, and many threads were gravedug. Regardless of all of this however, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] fortunately created safeguards against these types of issues years ago so any of the damage caused by [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1452467][color=#383838][b]Morchid's[/b][/color][/url] account is completely reversible, just annoying to deal with. Many users have been PM'ing [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] regarding the issue with ideas of what might have happened to his account however [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made it clear that the who or what causing the problem is immaterial and unless it was a direct security breach to him then his one sole mission is to simply fix the damage and work to prevent future situations of the same nature. To read [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient's[/b][/color][/url] threads regarding the matter you may do so, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5144388]here[/url], [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5144547]here[/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5144199]here[/url].\n\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]Concluding the Issue of Morchid's Account[/b][/color]\nOn January 23rd, 2016 the same day that the problems happened, were fixed. Basically whoever was behind the rampage only had two main options, one was to stick and unstick threads while the other was the ability to move threads. With that about 100,000 threads were moved and stuck and some sections were completely cleared out and moved to various Marketplace sections. Fortunately with a kind attitude from [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url], instead of taking the site offline for a couple of hours and doing a rollback to 30 hours prior he took care of the underline problem himself so that members didn't have to lose any progress made within those 30 hours. Sections [i]should[/i] have been fixed with all their proper threads re-added however if you still have a thread that needs to be placed back in its proper section you may visit the professional thread mover,  [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501][color=#9999FF][b]Roger Waters'[/b][/color][/url] thread where he will kindly move it back for you. That thread can be found, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5145332]here[/url]. Of course [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] will take future precautions in trying to prevent this problem from ever happening again however with how easy it is for this problem to emerge, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] doesn't believe it will be an easy thing to do. One thing [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] can promise however is that if there ever is an issue with everything that it's just an interruption and inconvenience at best, and that HF will always come back online.

The exploit was discovered by Security Researcher Justin Case. The exploit is caused by a debug tool that was opened up for carriers to test phones on their networks, but the tool was left on devices that were shipped out. This leaves all of them vulnerable. The exploit opens up an opportunity for hackers to remotely access user’s private contacts, messages, photos, videos and other private data. The exploit is specific to the MediaTek MT6582 processor, which is used in many popular Android devices. A statement was released that it's up to all OEMs to patch the exploit themselves, leaving consumers with only one option to be safe for now: keep the device offline. MediaTek is taking steps to alert all manufacturers to patch this as soon as possible.\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align]\n\n[url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35445065][b][color=#FFFFFF]Four Anti-Government Militants Remain in Standoff in Oregon[/color][/b][/url]\nIn early January, a group of armed anti-government militants forcefully occupied a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, in protest of what they believe to be illegal land seizure by the federal government. On Tuesday several of the militants were arrested, including their leader. One of the members was killed on Tuesday as well, when he allegedly reached for a handgun in his pocket. Today, only four of the occupying militants remain on the property in a stand-off with authorities. Group leader Ammon Bundy has asked the remaining four to surrender and continue fighting their legal battle in court. The men that are left have refused to stand down until they are assured that they will not be arrested. All other arrested members of the group are being held until the remaining four surrender themselves. \n\n[url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/asia/china-trapped-miners-rescue/index.html][b][color=#FFFFFF]Four Chinese Miners Rescued After 36 Days Underground[/color][/b][/url]\nMore than a month after the collapse of a gypsum mine in China, four survivors have finally been rescued. Of the 29 people who were originally in the collapse, 11 escaped, one was confirmed dead, and 17 were thought to be trapped. The remaining 13 miners are still missing. The four who have been rescued were discovered five days after the collapse when rescue workers used infrared cameras to search the mines. They survived with the help of workers who drilled small holes to lower down food and clothing for them. The owner of the mine, Ma Congbo, committed suicide just two days after the collapse. \n\n[url=http://www.com][b][color=#FFFFFF]Two Italian Mafia Bosses Arrested[/color][/b][/url]\nTwo men who were considered Italy's most dangerous criminals, have been arrested. Giuseppe Crea and Giuseppe Ferraro are long time fugitives that have evaded capture for years. Ferraro was convicted of murder and mafia association in 1998, and Crea was convicted of mafia associated in 2007. Both were part of a criminal organization called Ndrangheta, which is tied to drug trafficking, kidnapping, murders and corruption. The two men were found in an underground bunker, surrounded by rifles, pistols and machine guns. Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said \"Today is another wonder day for everyone and for the country because justice has won\".\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

They claim there will be three expansions with a few other things to the side. First off, we have Underground, which opens a whole new territory for players to explore giving them even more things to do in the vast, open world. Next up on the list is Survival, which at times will turn the map into a Dark Zone. These Dark Zones are projected to be a competitive PvP element of the game. Last, but certainly not least, is Last Stand, which we still have no info yet on what that expansion will be like. Season Pass holders will receive monthly benefits such as weapon skins and other cosmetic items. The game with the pass will be roughly $100, and if you chose to purchase the game as it is, it will cost $60. \n\n[url=http://www.e-league.com/news/2016/1/28/official-eleague-schedule-release][b][color=white]Televised E-Sports League \"ELEAGUE\" Schedule Announced[/color][/b][/url]\nBack in early 2015, Turner announced it will be televising E-Sports (primarily CS:GO) in the United States. ELEAGUE is an eSports league allowing other competitive eSports teams to compete against each other for the projected grand prize of $1.2 million. Currently, the league is only set to stream CS:GO, which is one of the rising eSports currently. However, it is speculated that they will host other eSports events as well. It will begin with group play starting on May 24 and ending July 1. That is when they will begin to play the last chance qualifier, the quarter finals, semifinals, and the grand finals. All of this will run from July 12 to July 30. This is without a doubt a huge step for the eSports scene in general and there is much more to come not only from Turner, but many other companies in the near future.\n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-appoints-a-new-ceo/1100-6434241/][b][color=white]Bungie Hires a New CEO[/color][/b][/url]\nCreators of Destiny, Bungie, have recently appointed a new CEO. Harold Ryan, who has been in the game development industry for quite some time now, has stepped down from his position as CEO of the company. However, it is unsure why he stepped down. Pete Parsons has now stepped up from being the company's COO since 2002 and will now take the roll Ryan had held for so long. Parsons stated in an interview that players have not seen the company's full potential and wants to bring everything they have out of them to produce better games.\n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Angel.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=left]\n[color=white][url=https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/moving_to_a_plugin_free][b]Oracle Finally Decides to Kill Its Java Browser Plug-In[/b][/url][/color]\nOracle has finally decided to retire the infamously insecure Java browser plug-in about a year from now. “Oracle plans to deprecate the Java browser plugin in JDK 9,” the Java Platform Group said in a blog post this past Wednesday, Jan. 28. This technology will be removed from the Oracle JDK and JRE in a future Java SE release. It is a move that is entirely logical, and really too late. Google removed the technology needed for Java applets in Chrome this past September, and Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system shipped with its Edge browser six months ago without support for plugins like Java. Mozilla has announced plans to remove support for plugins like Silverlight and Java in Firefox by the end of the year.\n\n[color=white][url=http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/28/oneplus-x-no-invite/][b]OnePlus X Waves Goodbye to Invites[/b][/url][/color]\nThe OnePlus X has officially ditches the notorious invite system and is readily available to all prospective customers, no longer making customers jump through hoops to get the handset. OnePlus made some serious waves with its \"flagship killer\" strategy, offering high-end devices at a fraction of the cost of other comparable flagships with similar specifications. However, the company decided to make its smartphones available only through invites, which severely limited their reach. Having launched in November, the OnePlus X is dropping its invite requirement faster than either of its predecessors. \n\n[color=white][url=http://www.ibtimes.com/x-games-livestreams-go-mobile-gopro-periscope-partnership-prior-competition-2286385][b]GoPro to Partner With Twitter's Periscope[/b][/url][/color]\nGoPro is teaming up with Twitter-owned Periscope to allow users to broadcast live from their GoPro Hero4 cameras connected to iPhones. Now, instead of filming your action scenes and posting the result on YouTube later, you can broadcast to the Periscope community in real time. As soon as the GoPro is paired to an iPhone, it will recognize the Periscope app and let users record and share their surroundings with a live audience. The unique function with this setup is that it allows you to use a two-camera shot for “more dynamic storytelling in real time,” GoPro says. At the same time, the GoPro footage is recorded onto an SD card, allowing you to use the footage later.\n[/align] \n\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/GroupNews.png[/img][/align]\n[align=center][img]http://www.hackforums.news/assets/v1/Ariana.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Group Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Axiom was sold to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=55709][color=#EFEFEF][b]Glit͙ch[/b][/color][/url] and was rebranded into Riptide.[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Leadership Changes[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=271731][color=#383838][b]Loki123[/b][/color][/url] is no longer a leader of The Brotherhood.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=121026][color=#EFEFEF][b]Funtage[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Echo.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2553288][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fiz[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Prism.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2974209][color=#EFEFEF][b]MagicFlakes[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Prism.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2776397][color=#EFEFEF][b]YoungThug.[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Prism.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=710987][color=#EFEFEF][b]Young Thug[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Prism.\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1185212][color=#EFEFEF][b]Fiber[/b][/color][/url] is now a leader of Royalty.\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Site Group Recruitment[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4906775][b]Writers - Wiki Team Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Current Open Group Recruitments[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5126569][b][Official] Brotherhood Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5153217][b]Dawn - iOS & Android App Dev Student Program[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5101704][b]Enigma | Official Recruitment[/b][/url][*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5152329][b]Official Group | Riptide | General Information & Recruitment[/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5070037][b][Recruiting] Royalty [Official Group][/b][/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5122957][b][SPECIALISTS] General Recruitment - Are you a Specialist?
