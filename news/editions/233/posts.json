Fortunately, this is no longer the case after March 26th, 2015, as the Prestige formula has finally been put to use and allows any member with a Prestige of 25 or more — regardless of rank. The announcement thread can be viewed [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4747439]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Sales Tags Introduced[/color][/b]\nAfter the [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4300998]initial preview[/url] of tags purchasable with Omnicoin to decorate thread titles in June of 2014, they were seen in action on March 26th, 2015, across several Marketplace sub forums. Many members were concerned over the tags' strong presence littering the marketplace sub forums, however this is still in testing with many changes to be made, and [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] is seeking members to design potential tags for the forum. If you feel yourself capable or wish to view current submissions and impressions, more information can be found in the announcement thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4748538]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Session Cookies Tightened[/color][/b]\nTo help protect members' accounts, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made several adjustments the core MyBB cookie class which now terminates the sessions across every device accessing the account.

More information can be found in the announcement thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4747565]here[/url].\n\n[b][color=white]Reputation Characters Restricted[/color][/b]\nMany members have included the range of characters that exceed their row's comment bounds when giving reputation, obstructing other table entries. To combat this, the entry field for comments has now followed suit of thread titles and no longer supports special characters i.e. characters outside the Latin alphabet.

Welcome to the 233rd Edition of the HF News. Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] Well all my friends are gone, but why not. Tibit, 'Snorlax, Roger, Connected, Nico, D3x, and devi01!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Aw that sucks. So let's begin, what got you started here on HackForums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] I touched on this briefly in my feed back thread (http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4660068) but it all started when my step brother, xbennetxk, showed me a RAT. I believe it was CyberGate. We took interest in how it worked so I asked how he did it. Eventually he showed me HF and through time I have become far more active than he ever was.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Nice. How long have you been into RATs? Did you post a lot in the Remote Administration Tools subforum? Did anyone in particular stand out to you in that section?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] Well when I started to become active is when the BlackShades drama happened, which led me away from the hacking niche to computing. That is when I began being active with mobile devices and the Apple OS X section.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] And how long have you been interested in those two topics? Have you done anything extensive regarding either? Any projects?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'd say I'm known for the iOS section, or atleast was, because of how active I was back in the day. I was actually the member that made the suggestion to make two separate mobile sections (iOS & Android) rather than have a general section for both. As for the iOS section, I've made a handful of homemade tutorials along with the sticky for the section. Nowadays I don't tend to make any tutorials or post much in the section since the jailbreak community is rather dead, and I have other commitments on Hack Forums that need attention too.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of those other commitments on HackForums, how long have you been a mentor? How many hours do you put into HF everyday while carrying out your role?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] I've been a mentor for just a little over a year now. How many hours I put into HF isn't really relevant to me being mentor, but I'd say I spend anywhere from half an hour to three hours a day depending on my schedule. One of the beauties of being a mentor though is that there are no set quotas or requirements to remain in \"Omni's Private Army\". We just do what we can when we can, and try to help Staff out when we get the chance.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] If given the opportunity, would you choose to become a Staff member?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] There is actually a story that relates that and me being mentor that I'll probably need to tell before answering that. So before I was invited to be a mentor, I was asked to be Staff by Omni himself. Keep in mind this was the middle of my Senior year in High School, and I was leading the Empire at the time. When Omni asked, I declined his offer for a few reasons. The first being school and how busy I was with either social or educational events. The second being how active I was with the Empire and members in the group, I didn't want to get myself in a position where I would be tempted to be \"corrupt\" and screw everything I worked for up. And lastly, I knew HF's policies very broadly compared to now. After declining Omni's offer, he made me mentor for the time being. With that being said, I would accept being invited to Staff if given the opportunity now.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting! Speaking of the Empire and groups, what is your opinion on the majority of the groups currently being run on HackForums? Do you believe they were run better in the past, or now?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] I've discussed this topic several times in the past with many different people and after some thinking I believe I finally have the right answer. Currently, I think that most groups do not live up to their potential. Without \"dissing\" any group in particular I'd say that each one of them have plenty of room for improvement. Those with the limited member base do not do enough and those with a wide member base try to remain exclusive. With that being said I would say groups in the past were more successful in the fact that \"exclusive\" groups did great things, and \"larger\" groups were willing to include the entire site. All in all, I think it comes down to both good leadership AND a good member base within the group.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Cool insight. Now, let's move away from HackForums and talk about your life off of the web. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you partake in off of the internet?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] Are you trying to tell me life exists away from my computer... lol. Well other than HF, I'm currently a Computer Science major. I'm in a few student organizations/clubs that deal with technology. Beside from that, I just hangout with my friends, with my girlfriend, or with my family.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] That's nice. Do you play any sports? Any favorite teams?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not much of a sports fan myself. My friends and family love watching games but I'll usually get on HF when they do. I used to play tennis, robotics, and stage crew in high school if that counts for anything.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Ah alright! Do you have any TV series or movies that you enjoy?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] Of course, I love watching movies. A handful of series that I like(d) include: The Walking Dead, Dexter, Breaking Bad, White Collar, Flashpoint, Bones, MythBusters, Shameless, Bates Motel, Shark Tank, and a lot more over the years.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Speaking of Shark Tank, are you interested in business? Have you run any businesses on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] I am interested in business, but I don't have the skill or resources to do much with it in terms of the marketplace on HF. I have ran a few things in the HF marketplace. I ran the Empire SMS bomber, iOS UDID activation, and I teased a Pandora Importer for jailbroken iOS users.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] And how much did you approximately earn off of those businesses?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] I didn't run the SMS Bomber project, I just made the sales thread since I was in the mobile niche at the time, so I didn't make much from that. The iOS UDID activation's vary on the year and how prepared I am. With preparation a few hundred dollars can be made. Nothing crazy.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1014629][color=#00BFFF][b]Astute:[/b][/color][/url] Well, I wish we could hear more from you, but that's all the time we have for this interview. Any closing comments?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1306528][color=white][b]xadamxk:[/b][/color][/url] YOU LIE. YOU HAVE MORE TIME. But if this is my last chance to talk I'd like to focus on everyone in the community. Whether you are a normal, L33t, or upgraded member remember that HF is a community and together we work to make HF what it is. With that being said, be active, contribute, and do what you can to make HF better. Together we can all improve the forum greatly, but only if we work together on it.

Are there any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] Just wanna give a shout out to Jon Coaster #on your forehead\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] So how were you introduced to HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] I've heard about HF through a friend way before I joined finally in 2013 i wanted to learn .net better so I joined. It's been absolutely amazing ever since\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] What made you decide to stay here?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] The people here make me laugh, I've spent my whole life online and haven't found a place remotely close.  And even amongst hackers I feel safe and at home on the forums\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, it definitely is a unique site with tons of cool things. Speaking of which, you sell some pretty interesting things yourself right? Could you tell us more about that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] Sure thing! I sell an array of food products here on the forums mostly keeping a \"Hawaii\" theme (I'm from Hawaii) some of which include pesto, ghost peppers, lilikoi butter, kawa, coconuts, and cake in a cup. I'm also slowly trying to release non eatable products like custom 3d printed iPhone cases. I'm one of the few people members trust to send physical items to them\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That's really cool honestly, I could use some \"cupcakes\" right about now. So how did you get into selling this stuff in the first place?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] I started off trying to sell some of the programs I created here and that didn't go too well so I ended up thinking to myself what isn't on here that people would buy and I was thinking well I'm a fat ass, and other people must be fat asses so let's sell food! It was really hard at first to become trusted because this is a hacker forums people were reluctant to give out their personal information but over time I gained a reputation of being trustworthy enough to send people goods. I'm beyond blessed that I received the amount of support that I did from the community and I owe it to the forums for my continued success.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty sweet way to make money if you ask me. Do you make the food yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] Not only do I make the food my self, most of our products are grown by my self.  The products that I can't grow on my own are bought locally; we only provide the best for our customers.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Did you have any prior experience running businesses and stuff like that?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] This is my first business regarding food but previously I owned a company that sold replica Hawaiian artifacts we were in shops like the ABC store and Hilo Hattie but that crumbled due to my partner at the time filling paperwork behind my back, my second business was a real estate development company which is still in business today and is my main source of income. We develop houses and offices mainly.  I got kicked out of my private school at 17 and decided that I didn't want to flip burgers for the rest of my life and decided to be an entrepreneur. It has been an incredible challenge as people brought me down the whole way but I didn't give up if I had any words for anyone who wanted to be an entrepreneur I would just say follow your passion and don't give up things will be hard but once you find your niche there's no greater high then being your own boss.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] I wish I had the time and motivation to do that, sounds like a great learning experience. So what do you think of these new marketplace tags?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] I actually really like them I'm just curious where it's going to go if it's going to be something we have to purchase or something that we have to earn. I think it's really going to change the marketplace for the better.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Pretty sure it's purchased through OMC, I could be wrong. What's one thing you'd change on the forum?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] If I could change one thing about these forums I'd want to put a section that has to do with everything food related haha\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That would lead to some interesting threads. Anyway that's all the time I have. Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap up this interview?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097293][color=white][b]Who Soup:[/b][/color][/url] I just want to say I heard Omni is a good cook, and I want to challenge him one day to a cook off!\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

This will go into effect on Edition 234 so make sure to check out the new section starting next week.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Podcast Has A New Host[/color][/b]\r\nAs many of you can tell, Baghead as stepped down and Orchid has taken his place. This will be permanent and Orchid will stay with us until he leaves Hack Forums. This took effect with today's edition, number 233. We'd love to hear your feedback on this change.\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]More Sections?[/color][/b]\r\nMusic News and World News may make a comeback, it's still being discussed but we'd like to hear from you, do you think it should be included in our weekly editions or not. Let us know what you think by posting in this thread.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",

Cryptographers and mathematicians have long-since realized that part of the PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) used for encryption gave out some predictable bytes, but in 2013, a team of security researchers developed a way to decrypt small amounts of HTTPS traffic. In 2013, the attack require over 70 billion data points (same data encrypted with different RC4 passwords) in order to guess future bytes. Even though it required a large amount of repeated captures of the same data, Internet giants, such as Google, took countermeasures against it. Now, recent refinements to the attack allow it to be done with around 60 millions data points, which is less than one tenth of one percent of the original attack. Another attack, dubbed the Bar-Mitzvah Attack, utilizes a 13-year old weakness (hence the name 'Bar Mitzvah' which is a Hebrew tradition that teenage males perform) in the RC4 algorithm which led to the successful exploitation of WEP (Wired Equivalency Protection). It allows for a non-negligible probability of decrypting parts of the TLS encrypted packets.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Thousands of Twitch Accounts Have Been Breached[/b][/color]\r\nThe well-known streaming site, Twitch, which enables PC gamers to stream their gameplay live, has had several thousand accounts breached by unknown hackers. Amazon purchased Twitch in 2014, and has therefore taken responsibility for this breach. Amazon took several active measures such as resetting all of the user passwords as well as disconnecting their accounts other social media accounts that are used for Twitch promotion such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Though it is not known how user accounts were breached, or if the Twitch website itself was attacked, Twitch accounts for about 2% of all United States Internet traffic and a vulnerability in the website, if left unpatched, would have detrimental repercussions. According to the Wall Street Journal, who obtained a copy of an email that Twitch sent out to its affected users, reported that Twitch had said that many items including passwords, e-mail addresses, usernames, home addresses, phone numbers, and birthdays may have been accessed. The company has not outright confirmed a breach, saying that it's still investigating.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Vawtrak Trojan[/b][/color]\r\nA new malicious trojan program called Vawtrak has recently come to light. Discovered by a group of security researchers, it has the ability to talk over the well-known encrypted, anonymous communication network, Tor. Malware programs of this caliber are usually nothing special, however, Vawtrak is specifically designed to be deployed within banking networks and has many specific bank-oriented features built into it such as stealing financial information and executing bank transactions. It has been found in the wild spreading by several methods, such as emails, document exploits, and social engineering, but once it is installed, it attempts to spread itself by drive-by downloads, malware downloaders, and exploit kits. Vawtrak uses a custom Tor2Web proxy program that allows it to connect to hidden services and maintain an encrypted connection to its Command and Control central server without having to download 3rd party applications like Vidalia or the Tor Browser. Bank viruses are slowly becoming more and more popular in the malware community, which also means that malware protection is being taken more seriously.\r\n[/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ymeMSvr.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][align=left]\r\n\n[b][color=white] Cisco Patches DoS Vulnerabilities in IOS Software [/color][/b]\r\nCisco, the company behind most enterprise networking equipment, released several patches to their IOS and IOS XE software last week. The company released a patch to fix sixteen vulnerabilities across seven components of their IOS software. These vulnerabilities affect Autonomic Network Infrastructure (ANI), Common Industrial Protocol (CIP), multicast Domain Name System (mDNS), TCP, Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF), Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2), and Cisco IOS XE software. The vulnerabilities are said to be executed by an attacker that can be both remote and unauthenticated and would be able to exploit the system to trigger a DOS on a targeted system. Other vulnerabilities which have been patched include DOS conditions on routers and switches normally configured for virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), memory leaks with IPv4 and IPv6 packets on the UDP port 5353, and Vulnerabilities in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 protocol (IKEv2) allowing an attacker to trigger a DoS attack with malformed IKEv2 packets. Cisco has claimed there is no reason to suggest these vulnerabilities have been exploited as there is no evidence of it.\r\n\n[b][color=white] Nearly Half of all Android Users Exposed to Installation Vulnerability [/color][/b]\r\nIn a statement this week, a security firm called Palo Alto Network claimed to have found a vulnerability in the Android operating system. The statement claims a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use vulnerability was discovered sometime late last year and allows an attacker to hijack a process called the 'application installation process'. The hijack gives an attacker to take control of APKs while they install and instead install malware onto the device. A researcher for Palo Alto wrote: “We have successfully tested both exploits against Android 2.3, 4.0.3-4.0.4, 4.1.X, and 4.2.x. According to Android Dashboard, this vulnerability affected approximately 89.4 percent of the Android population as of January 2014 (when we first discovered it), and approximately 49.5 percent of the Android population as of March 2015.” According to Zhi Xu of Palo Alto Networks, the exploit is only possible through any third party marketplaces on Android versions listed above. The reason the exploit isn't possible on the Official Google Play store is that the Play store will only download the APKs into protected areas on the device that can only be used for the Google Play store. Third party applications, APKs, and stores cannot access the protected        reserved for Google Play.\r\n\n[b][color=white] RadioShack Planning to Auction Customer Data[/color][/b]\r\nRadioShack, a technology based retail chain, is looking to sell out their customer data from underneath themselves in part to their recent bankruptcy sale. [url=http://www.hilcostreambank.com/assets/radioshack-assets-for-sale]Hilco Streambank[/url] claims that over 65 million customer's names and addresses, alongside millions of emails, can now be purchased by who ever is willing to pay the highest bid. In doing so, RadioShack is breaching their own privacy policy seen [url=http://www.radioshack.com/privacy-policy/privacy.html]HERE[/url]. The auction for the information has been won by RadioShack's largest shareholder Standard General. In various courts throughout the country, appeals and objections are already being made in an attempt to not allow this large dump of information to be handed out. Authorities including New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman are trying to make sure this illegal breach of privacy won't be allowed. These cases will be ongoing and more information will be provided when the situation gets updated.\r\n\n[/align][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]\r\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/spXlHGR.png[/img][/align]\r\n\n[align=center][align=left]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Konami At Odds with Kojima[/color][/b]\r\nEarlier this month Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series of videogames, announced that [i]Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[/i] would be the last Metal Gear game with his involvement. It was later discovered that Konami had removed all Kojima Productions branding from promotional materials for the upcoming game, which was featured prominently in promotions for past games in the series.It has also been noticed that the current images of the Metal Gear Solid titles on the official Metal Gear website have been edited to remove Hideo Kojima’s name from the covers. This was discovered after comparing the site’s current images with archived images from the past. While Konami is still refusing to confirm Kojima’s involvement with the company past [i]The Phantom Pain[/i], they have announced that they will be hiring a new development team for the Metal Gear game following [i]The Phantom Pain[/i]. Though tensions may be raised, [i]The Phantom Pain[/i]’s September 1st release date has remained unchanged.\r\n\n[url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/19/8257283/metal-gear-solid-konami-branding]Source[/url]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Xbox One and PS4 Release of Batman Arkham Series Rumored\r\n[/color][/b]Remastered versions of the critically-acclaimed [i]Batman: Arkham City[/i] and [i]Arkham Asylum[/i] are rumored to be a part of a remastered Arkham collection for the Xbox One and Playstation 4 consoles. This rumor comes from a source close to IGN Italy. Other information from the source states that the games will be released around the upcoming holiday season at the end of 2015. [i]Batman: Arkham Asylum[/i] and [i]Batman: Arkham City[/i] both garnered extremely high praise from a high number of different video game review publications, IGN included. News of a remastered re-release of these games is definitely not far from the realm of possibility, with games like [i]God of War III[/i] announced to be having a Playstation 4 remastered re-release,[i] The Last of Us[/i] having received a remastered re-release, and the Master Chief collection of Halo games being released on the Xbox One. While players may be itching for new and original content, it would be far-fetched to say that these re-mastered re-releases won’t be met with fanfare from their longtime fans.\r\n\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-duo-remastered-for-ps4-and-xbox-one-/1100-6426085/]Source[/url]\r\n\n[b][color=white]Free Game for PS Plus Owners on PS4 for April Revealed[/color][/b]\r\nPlaystation Plus members will have the game [i]Woah Dave![/i] made available to them for free for the month of April on the Playstation 4.

The speed-limiting feature can be activated via the steering wheel and briefly overridden by pressing firmly on the accelerator. The car facility ensures it will help drivers avoid fines and drastically reduce the number of accident to ford car drivers, both an intelligent & wise move by the well renown car company. However, one car expert stated that the innovation might only serve as a \"stopgap\".\r\n\n\"There's a plan for speed restrictions to be beamed to your car's computer systems and controlled from there, rather than requiring street sign visual recognition systems\", said Paul Newton, an automotive industry analyst at the IHS consultancy. \"This would be part an extension of the networks that will connect vehicles, allowing cars to warn those behind them if they are slowing down, which is all part of a move toward autonomous vehicles that drive themselves.\"\r\n\nSuch a system, however, is a long way down the road. The new Ford feature will become available in the closing stages of this year, somewhere around September when it launches the second generation of its S-Max cars in Europe. A spokesman for the US car company told the BBC the facility would probably be extended to other models around the world.\r\n\n[b][color=white]How mind-controlled bionics could shape the future[/color][/b]\r\nA new prototype prosthetic arm was developed for a young YouTube star named Grace Mandeville, and has caught like wildfire ever since. It acts as an arm which is controlled by the impulses in your muscles, allowing you to move it freely as you wish. \r\n\nHugh Herr, from the Center for Extreme Bionics at MIT, recently suggested that advances in bionics could one day mean an end to mental disability. Quite a bold claim however one that comes from a man who helped a dance teacher who lost her leg in the Boston marathon bombings get back onto the dancefloor. And away from headline-grabbing events such as actor Robert Downey Jr offering an 'Iron Man hand' to a young US fan, it's possible to understand Dr Herr's excitement.\r\n\nThis surgical procedure, developed by scientists at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, seeks to reassign nerves that once controlled the arm and hand that's been lost, to the pectoral muscles. This allows those who have had upper-arm amputations to control their prosthetic devices by thinking about the action they want to perform, pretty cool right? This procedure is now available to the public.\r\n\n[color=white][b]Twitter launches video streaming app Periscope[/b][/color]\r\nOn Thursday, Twitter released a video streaming app named Periscope, just days after reports that it had blocked a rival app called Meerkat. Meerkat relies heavily on Twitter and has become hugely popular since its release, yet to be shot down by Twitter's new release. Twitter's announcement comes on the same day that Meerkat unveiled a list of investors that included Silicon Valley venture capitalists Greylock Partners and Sound Ventures, Ashton Kutcher's fund.Meerkat's new round of funding is widely expected to have raised millions of dollars.\r\n\nThe app, which already boasts celebrity users such as talk show host Jimmy Fallon, lets people stream videos that cannot be rewatched. Twitter said in a blog post that it bought Periscope back in January and has been an ongoing project ever since, unlike Meerkat, Periscope allows users to save and replay videos later, according to tech website The Verge. The app is currently available in the Apple App Store, and an Android app is also in the works, Twitter said.\r\n[/align][/align]\r\n\n[color=transparent]      [/color]",
