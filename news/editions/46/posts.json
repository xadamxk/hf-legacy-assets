This is due to the large amount of packet loss we have been having over the past month, as well as slow loading time. After this move we are back and faster than ever thanks to [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url]. The official statement can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1370481]here[/url].\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has banned all discussion of Deep Web (if you don't know what Deep Web is or would like to read further on this topic, click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1377240]here[/url]). It has also been added to the Help Documents under [url=http://hackforums.net/misc.php?action=help&hid=21]Disallowed Black Hat Activity[/url] for those who are still skeptic of its ban. \r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has posted a thread explaining the difference between the phrase \"ass kissing\" and the made up phrase \"ass licking.\" If you'd like to read the responses to this click [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1383226]here[/url]. \r\n\r\nThe \"Welcome back <username here>\" message is now hyperlinked to each users' profile. This means you can click your name and go directly to your own profile instead of going through the User CP to do so. \r\n\r\nThe Portal.php feature has been removed this week due to its lack of use by both members and management alike. For those who actually used it, don't expect it to be added back any time soon.\r\n\r\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033][color=lime][b]xerotic[/b][/color][/url] has taken a few days off to experience the wonders of Disney Land, he will return on the 18th.

The Microsoft press conference has announced many new things. Xbox Live has been updated to have live TV, you can access YouTube and other things of that nature. Kinect has also been slightly updated for voice commands, and better use of the no controller concept. To me, it seems like it is getting closer and closer to being like Gamer. The Sony Press Conference has announced a new 24\" 3D TV. Sony has also announced the PlayStation Vita which was formally known as Next Generation Portable (NGP, which has also been named Nintendo Got Pwned). The PlayStation Vita is the successor to the PSP. It features a OLED touch screen, two joysticks, a front facing and rear camera, and a touch pad on the back. All of these new controls are essentially paradise or hell for game developers. At the Nintendo Conference, the Wii U was announced. This is a controller/separate console/additional screen for the Wii. It has a front facing camera, a 16:9 aspect ratio 6.2 screen, it is 1.8 inches think, 7 inches tall, and 10.5 inches wide. Nintendo has said that they created this for its experience to be \"wide and deep.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the longest lunar eclipse in 11 years occurred. The Moon turned a bloody red that amazed thousands of sky watchers that got the opportunity to see the wondrous event. The event started at 1:24 PM EDT and lasted until 7:00 PM EDT. Google has changed its logo to commemorate this event. I, among many unfortunately, did not get the chance to view this event.[/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNInterviews.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\r\n[size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][color=deepskyblue]Interview 1 - Tsgh Mike[/color][/font][/size]\r\n[spoiler][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXuNjkuH5pQ[/yt][/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNClassifieds.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=left][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1158830][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/Attbooter.png[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n[align=right][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1277828][IMG]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy322/valik140795/LAL-1.gif[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n[align=left][url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1234293][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/Cobaltebook.png[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n[align=right][url=http://www.mskeys.in][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/X3GG1.jpg[/IMG][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center][IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/Qwazzy/HF%20News/HFNTeam.png[/IMG][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Publisher & Head Writer[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=295848]Qwazz[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Publishers Assistant[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=175033]xerotic[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Writers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=277712]Cobalt[/url] - Other News\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=153686]Fireren[/url] - Headlines\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]Sir[/url] - User News\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Reporters[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=129444]3x0r_$c0rPi0n[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=126243]Decoy[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=114470]F4T4L 3RR0R[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=656453]ReactioNz[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=168826]Tyler777[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=200751]Zach[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=115612]-BoodyE-[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=137080]Boxing[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=92059]Security™[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Editor[/b] [/color]\r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=70881]Paradoxum[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=white][b]Graphic Designer[/b][/color] \r\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=566671]panDa.[/url]\r\n[/list]",
