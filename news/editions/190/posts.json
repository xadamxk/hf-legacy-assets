Released on April 5th, 2014, the coin has both rose and dropped in value as the difficulty fluctuated. Prices have been seen ranging from $1 per 8 coins to $1 for 50 coins, depending on the fear of some that it would bottom out. Several weeks after the release, usage for this coin seems to be on an inclining slope. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] created a thread titled [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4170257][b]Vote for Omnicoin at Coinpayments[/b][/url] in order to promote activity that would benefit the possibility of the addition of OMC (OmniCoin) to the popular payment website [url=http://coinpayments.com][b]CoinPayments[/b][/url]. OMC is now on track to be added to less popular exchanges in order to confirm its placement on the CoinPayments, which requires the presence on at least one recognized exchange. The possible affects of being added to an exchange could either help or destroy the coin and those invested will surely hold their breath as the latest developments pass by.

 Welcome to 190th edition of the HF News, today we're here with Craze. Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] Hey, I'd like to give a shout out to Vinnie, Package, Packages Dad and Instinct! :D\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So Craze from what I've heard you're friends with Vinnie IRL, is it true he likes the cock?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] I've seen Vinnie checking out boys at the gym so I suppose he must have interest in some cock. Especially the wieners the body builders have! undefined undefined\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Ok, now it's time to get more serious. Tell me, what do you do outside of Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] I currently play semi-professionally for a football club named Brentford, I like to go to the gym and most of all just hang out with mates. :D\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Nice, football (soccer for me) has never been a sport I have been good in. You currently lead Instinct, how has it been so far?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] That's a shame as it's a fun sport :P. Instinct has been great so far, so many fantastic members in it who love to have a laugh. I'm glad to have the opportunity to be leader of such a fantastic group. undefined\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Awesome! I love the group myself, the lounge is ridiculous. Anything we can expect in the future from the group?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] Well we don't have any major changes happening any time soon, however we do hope we can host some tournaments within the group and give our gamers a chance to win some fantastic prizes!! undefined\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Hex recently made the change from Void to Nexus, what's going to come out of this recent partnership between Instict and Nexus? Do you consider them the 3rd gaming group? Will they take away from the direction that Instinct is headed in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] I was shocked myself when I saw the partnership but most of all I found it interesting. I've never seen something like this before. We will have to wait and see what the partnership brings to HF! undefined I would personally consider Nexus a gaming group but I don't believe they are as advanced as Instinct and will affect Instincts positive direction because they are mainly focused on one game, League of Legends and Instinct is focused on many.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] The partnership seems to be good between them and I personally don't see them as a threat. How do you feel about the 3rd gaming group, Respawn?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] I feel like Respawn is a waste of a group. It is incredibly inactive and there is nothing positive coming out of it. I feel sorry for everyone who paid to get in. We'll just wait and see if Respawn ever decide to give Instinct a competitive match!!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Do you predict that Respawn might change their group direction in the near future? Instinct seems to be the dominating gaming group, can Astonish keep up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] I'd like to see Respawn pull their weight up and give Instinct a challenge. At the moment, the way Astonish runs Respawn I feel like he will never catch up. It's like comparing Brentford to Chelsea, no matter how hard Brentford try they will never be able to dominate Chelsea.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Soccer analogy, I get it. I'm from the US, enlighten me, how is UK life?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] Apart from the weather and the Feltham chavs, It can be a great place to live, study and play! How about the US?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] United States is alright... I live in the suburbs and attend college, so my days mainly consist of school, work, and having fun on the interwebs. Kinda sucks when you're attending community college and your friends are away at a major university, but I make the best of it. As a leader of a gaming group, what kind of games are you interested in?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] That sounds cool I suppose, I like many games where I can socialize and chill out such as Habbo and games such as League of Legends where I can rage at Etheral feeding 24/7!! As a member of Instinct, do you have similar interests?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I noticed you were active in the Habbo section and League seems way too intense for me to try to get into, I'll stick with Minecraft. How did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] It started 3 years ago when Vinnie referred my older brother to HF, he then decided to quit so I took over his account. After a lot of help from Vinnie which I still can't thank him enough - I am where I am today!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Jeez! Vinnie even recruits members IRL, that's a pretty interesting way to join if you ask me. How has your overall Hack Forums experience been? Being a group leader do you think it has changed it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] Haha yeah, Overall it's been great so far and being a leader of a great group has definitely made it more enjoyable for myself. It's also helped me get a good name out there for myself. (I hope at least) :D\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] If you could change one thing about the forum what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] Reputation abuse. So many innocent people get negged for silly reasons which could then backfire and ruin their reputation.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I agree with you on that one. I like the system, but it has been abused too much and with the removal of reputation abuse support over a year ago it has gone downhill. Well that's about all we have, do you have any closing statements for us today?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1216255][color=#EFEFEF][b]Cгaze:[/b][/color][/url] Thanks for interviewing me, it has been a pleasure speaking to you!

Today I'm here with +Cyan. How are you doing today? Do you have any shoutout's you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] I'm quite fine, yourself? I'd like to make a shoutout to LnstaKlLL for being a great friend. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Good to hear. I'm good thanks. So tell us a little bit about how you discovered HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] I found HackForums due to my brother talking about it a lot, and I was quite interested in being 'community trusted' and whatnot after originating from lower quality forums. I use to get hacked A LOT in the popular MMORPG RuneScape, which was another reason why I originally signed up.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Which other forums did you belong to before HF if you don't mind me asking?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] I belonged on Se7ensis and Sythe.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Oh nice, a fellow 7s member. I take it you were interested in some kind of game modding at one point or another?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] Yes I was, I take a massive interest in it, not exactly to 'modify' games and ruin it for other players, but as a learning experience and as a challenge, the fact that 'Xbox J-Tagging' and whatnot is so easy just blows my mind.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Did you ever create your own patches? What kind of things did you do with your jtag/RGH?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] I never got around to it due to in real life projects, but I mainly just put downloaded games on there and had some fun with friends when they come over.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url]  Nice nice. Did you ever host modded lobbies in exchange for money? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] Yes, I hosted Halo: Reach lobbies, not that I suggest doing so, but that's what people wanted and it made me some money on the side.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What did those Reach lobbies include? Do you still host these lobbies?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] Just ranking them up to the max level and unlocking the unlock able items they wanted. I do not due to doing stuff like exams, keeping up with homework and whatnot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Ah good ol' education. Are you still in highschool? If so, how's that going? If you're in post secondary school, what are you currently studying?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] I'm currently in grade 10, last year and then I go onto TAFE and University. \nIt could be better, is a real hassle for me, but I'm getting through it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] What exactly is TAFE? I apologize if that's a stupid question. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] It's pretty much further education where you can study what you want to study, in my case it'll be Computer Science. It's a better alternative than doing the extra years at school because you can focus on what you need/want to know and get the certificates for so.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Forsure. What exactly do you want to do with your education after you graduate?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] When I end up finishing my years at TAFE and University I plan on either 3D Animation and Graphics design or computer hardware engineer.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Lots of maths involved with that kind of thing. Best of luck with your academic pursuits. Do you have any general feedback for HF that you'd be willing to share with us?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] I do actually. I'd just like to make a few points about some things and some people. I think it's unfair that the staff member, Judge Dredd owns a user group, don't get me wrong, he's a nice staff member and I like him, but I don't think staff members should be allowed to own a user group, especially what happened a while ago with one of the old groups that I probably shouldn't mentioned. So far the forum is operating finely which I like, there's improvements that could be done, but I guess their wouldn't be 2 million UIDs if my ideas were terrible, I respect all staff members and majority of users, there is one message I'd like to say to everybody though:\nEverything on HF is numbers, it doesn't increase power, do not let it go to your head that you're more superior than others.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I'm unfamiliar with what you're referring to in regards to the staff owning their own usergroups? Care to explain?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] Okay well, I just don't think it's right that a staff member, in this case, Judge Dredd is allowed to own a custom user group let alone be in one. If I was the owner I would only want my staff members using the admin user bar, as it kind of looks like now that his group 'Infamous' is something more people want to get into just because he's a staff member and he's got 'power'. It's really hard to explain, but pretty much at the end of the day I understand being in a group.. I guess, but using that as your primary user bar, having it as your signature and avatar isn't right in my opinion.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] I can understand where you're coming from. I'd like to thank you for joining us tonight, if you have any closing statements now's the time to make the.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651474][b]+Cyan:[/b][/url] Just my opinion though, I'm glad you can understand.

Anyone you'd like to give a shout out to before we continue?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]:[/b][/color] Of course. I'd like to give a shoutout to Evangelist, Vinnie, Bandors, iNviZ, my lover Clique, and TheCrazy8th.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Hi to them! What point are you at in your education? In College/Highschool? Have a career made out yet for yourself?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]:[/b][/color] Currently in Middle College. Essentially, it's a community college combined with High School. I study college courses and high school courses while getting college credits to go along with it. I plan on pursing law and become a lawyer.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I wish you the best of luck in that field, as it is competitive. On the flip side of things -- how'd you stumble upon this board?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]:[/b][/color] My long time friend referred me to it, actually. He doesn't frequent it anymore and I don't remember his name. He wasn't even upgraded. When I first joined, I wasn't very active, but after a few months, I decided to come back and start posting and become very active.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What was the one thing that you immediately liked about the site when you first joined? What made you come back?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]:[/b][/color] I liked the activity in the SRPP section. Back then, it was very high quality and there was room for a lot of good debate. I got pretty bored over the summer and September, so I decided to come back.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Do you think that the SRPP section has taken a turn for the better now that only upgraded users can post there?\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php=action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]:[/b] Yes, actually. Many people don't like it, mostly the non-upgraded, but a lot of the low quality nonsense has been eradicated. There is much more good discussion going on now than before. I'm glad the change was made, even though it has sparked a lot of controversy.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Moving on. I know that you're an avid league of legends player. What got you into that?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]:[/b][/color] My friend got me into it. I played it since early Season 1. I played a few games and then dropped it. Skip forward to the end of Season 2, I picked up the game again and got placed in Bronze III. Didn't play too much ranked, but when Season 3 rolled out, I got to Gold II. In Season 4, I got to Platinum V.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Think you'll ever land in Diamond or challenger this season?

I think I can grind it out. The tips I can give to lower elo players is: Always learn from your mistakes and always keep yourself calm.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Best piece of advice that you can give.

In cases like Target, where thousands of credit card numbers were compromised, there is a lot of monetary backlash. Such is present all the way from fraudulent orders to credit card companies issuing new cards. This sure makes a big impact, especially when it is happening more and more often. A new bill would make businesses liable for all damage customers ascertain due to their negligence, as well as be responsible for telling them. This, however, isn't law yet and there are many problems surrounding it including the millions of dollars various corporations are willing to spend in addition to lobbying. The fact that this doesn't apply to government entities bothers many. The president of California Retailers Association, Bill Dombrowski, said \"We're opposed to the bill because it arbitrarily assesses financial penalties on the retailer, where in the real world, what happens after a breach is there's a forensic examination done and the banks and credit card companies and retailers all have to participate. That investigation determines who is responsible.\" So whether or not the bill will pass is in serious question, but the idea is important.\n\n[color=white][b]Google Says \"No\" to Antivirus Scandal[/b][/color]\nPaying $3.99 for an antivirus for Android? Not too bad, but it is when it's fake. One of the faster-growing paid apps, Virus Shield, was even featured to later be deemed a fake app claiming to be an antivirus. With almost 10,000 purchases, the owner was making tons of money off of a fake app! This comes close to an astonishing $40,000. The app, however, has now been removed by Google. This does potentially set a new precedent for rogueware on Android. This will undoubtedly open the idea of many other cunning scammers, so people should stay safe and only use reliable companies' tools.\n\n[color=white][b]Card Skimming Alive and Well[/b][/color]\nRecently, in a New York city subway station, a citizen found a pinhole sized camera designed to see credit card numbers of people who were using an ATM. This lead to a city-wide search of all ATMs in the subways as this isn't a completely rare incident. The idea is a bit old now, but it is still very alive and well. People should always exercise care and caution when and where they use their credit cards or even ATMs.\n\n[color=white][b]Security Tip of the Week[/b][/color]\nMobile security is often something people tend to ignore. The problem now, then, is that people are going to greater extents to infect phones, while the most typical reasoning is to install adware or even mine cryptocurrencies. Several top apps have been removed in the past due to the fact that they were also mining cryptocurrencies using the phone. Given that there are fake antivirus apps out, you should stick with something you know prior which has a good reputation.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/RKmUG6A.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Silk Road Defendants Want Charges Dropped if Bitcoin Isn't Money[/b][/color]\nFollowing the IRS' recent guidelines classifying Bitcoin as property instead of currency, two defendants charged with crimes related to money laundering have asked that the charges against them be dropped on a technicality. Adber Espinoza and Pascal Reid were charged with money laundering following an undercover sting operation that took place with officers posing as credit card fraudsters on LocalBitcoins.com, a popular \"Over-The-Counter\" exchange. Lawyers for the men have moved to drop the charges on the grounds that money laundering law couldn't apply to them if Bitcoin isn't money. This could potentially serve as a turning point for either the IRS' guidelines or Money Laundering statues and will serve as a legal precedent for the future of Bitcoin.\n\n[color=white][b]China Stymies Bitcoin Exchanges[/b][/color]\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) recently started calling exchanges, informing that if they did not stop their Bitcoin trading activities, that their bank accounts would be frozen. This has followed widespread speculation that PBOC would impose regulations or sanctions that would inhibit Bitcoin in the country. The news sparked a significant dip in Bitcoin's price as well with prices dropping ten percent following announcements on several exchanges including, but not limited to BTCTrade, a sizable Chinese exchange. BTC China, China's largest Bitcoin exchange, says that they had not received any notices from PBOC at the time of writing.\n\n[color=white][b]Payday Lending Falls Under Regulatory Scrutiny[/b][/color]\nPayday lenders, arguably one of the most dubious loan business out there, is falling under the scrutiny of the US Government. Regulators are claiming that payday advance loans can be classified as predatory. Payday loans are often high-interest on small dollar amounts with interest rates soaring as high as 350%. Payday loan storefronts are frequently seen in some of the economically hard-hit parts of America, offering \"quick cash before payday.\" They have gained popularity following the recent recession and leave some people buried in crippling debt. This regulatory scrutiny may be the turning point consumers need to recover from debt imposed by these payday loan companies.\n\n[color=white][b]Former Bitcoin-Friendly Bank Turns Back, Closes Accounts[/b][/color]\nThe National Australia Bank (NAB) has turned its back on Bitcoin. Formerly known as Australia's most Bitcoin-friendly bank, the bank has announced to its Bitcoin-involved customers that it will be closing their accounts. The banking industry in Australia is dominated by NAB, ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank, and Westpac, with Commonwealth being notably hostile towards Bitcoin. ANZ works with crypto currencies on a case-by-case basis, while Westpac's policy on Bitcoins remains unknown. Australian businesses working with crypto currencies, then, have informed news outlets that they are working on establishing more reliable relationships with other financial institutions.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/TF7PsyM.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Five year Old hacks Xbox Live Account[/b][/color]\nKristoffer Von Hassel, a five-year old boy, gained the gaming world's attention this week after coming across a flaw in the Xbox One system, allowing him to access his father's Xbox Live account without the correct credentials for the account. Kristoffer simply went to the account on the system and entered an incorrect password for the account, be taken to a password verification screen, and then all he had to do was press the space bar a few times and press enter to gain access to the account. Kristoffer's father reported the vulnerability to Microsoft and included him on their list of security researchers who have contributed to making Microsoft's online products and services safer. For his contribution, he is receiving four games, $50, and an annual subscription to Xbox Live from Microsoft.\n\n[color=white][b]Hearthstone's New Adventure Mode[/b][/color]\nThis week, Blizzard announced that there will be a new single-player adventure mode for the growing game \"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft.\" This new mode is set to be called \"Curse of Naxxramas,\" which has made appearances in previous Warcraft games. In this mode, players will be sent to an abandoned city which is said to be \"filled with the stuff of nightmares\" and be similar to World of Warcraft lore. Players will be allowed to use any deck of their choice and will face off against various bosses across five different wings of Naxxramas. Players will earn cards along their journey and will gain a legendary card at the end of each wing's challenge. A player will be able to earn a total of 30 cards in Nexxramas and all cards can be added to the existing decks of any player. Blizzard announced that they are planning to release this new adventure mode very soon and the five wings of Nexxramas will be released over the course of five weeks after the initial release. \n\n[color=white][b]Sony's New MMO: H1Z1[/b][/color]\nSony Online Entertainment announced their new MMO, an apocalyptic-zombie game, earlier this week. It is said to have clans, crews, and teams and will be an experience that will \"be better than DayZ.\" The game will take place 15 years after the outbreak of a fictional virus and players will be able to fight animals, other survivors, and last but not least, zombies. The game is described to have a sandbox-style gameplay, meaning players will be able to build their own shelters and forts. Sony said in an announcement that a main thing that will make H1Z1 different from games within the same genre is that there will be an emphasis on player's owning certain parts of the map and buildings. Players, then, will be able to build just about anything they'd like as long as they can find the parts for it. Though an official release date has yet to be announced, a playable version of the game is said to be released \"very soon.\"\n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of April 13, 2014:[/color][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn - Play Station 4 - April 14, 2014\n[*]2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil - Play Station 3, Xbox 360 - April 15, 2014\n[*]Trials Fusion - Play Station 4, Xbox 360 (Arcade), Xbox One - April 16, 2014\n[/list]\n\n[b][color=white]Upcoming Gaming Events:[/b][/color]\n\n[list]\n[*]None Reported\n\nInterested in having your gaming event posted in here?

While the changes made in this update are mostly under-the-hood improvements, they make room for some exciting features to be implemented in 1.8. In addition having its usual bug fixes, it also prepares Minecraft for the much-anticipated renaming feature; members with undesirable usernames will soon be able to switch! Improvements to Minecraft Realms have been made as well and the dev team has been working on tweaking the [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/22vu5w/upcoming_changes_to_the_block_model_system/]block models[/url] for texture pack enthusiasts. Because this update is so technically heavy, 1.7.5 servers are not compatible; server owners, be sure to update to 1.7.8 in preparation for the upcoming 1.8 update!\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hackercraft[/color] [color=#9428a8]Reset[/color][/b]\nHackerCraft has recently received a much-anticipated reset! With the 1.7.8 update, HackerCraft's old map was thrown out and a fresh, new world is now open and free to populate. HackerCraft has received multiple resets and revamps in the past; originally a prosperous PVP factions server, HackerCraft died for a while and was revamped as a peaceful farming server in the middle of 2013. With no PVP, it took the server a while to rebuild it's playerbase. It did, however, gain a steady stream of players with the implementation of the HackerCraft awards, however those players seemed to slowly trickle away as time went on. With the recent reset, however, HackerCraft is seeing a new stream of players eager to create new bases and farms. An exciting change this time around is the reintroduction of the Nether, a hell of a realm that many players missed. The spawn is still under construction and in fact, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1650008]Sudsy[/url] suggested that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1]Omniscient[/url] use the original HackerCraft spawn from 2012!

A new 12-week single tablet of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir has proven to be highly effective in treating a broad range of patients with H.C.V. genotype 1, a form of the virus found in up to 75 percent of infections (according to results unveiled today at the European Association for the Study of the Liver and published simultaneously online by the New England Journal of Medicine). Previous treatments for H.C.V. came along with symptoms such as anemia and depression. This new treatment, however, isn't only more effective, but it also does not cause dangerous symptoms.\n\n[b][color=white]Taking Iron Improves Women's Exercise Performance[/color][/b]\nWomen who take iron supplements experience an improvement in their exercise performance, according to a new study from the University of Melbourne. Such is improved in terms of both the highest level they could achieve at 100% exertion and their exercise efficiency at a sub-maximal exertion. Women who were given iron were able to perform a given exercise using a lower heart rate and at a higher efficiency. This marks the first time researchers have been able to identify the benefits of iron supplements on exercise performance. This study was done mainly on women who had an iron deficit and the top women athletes. According to lead researcher, Dr. Pasricha, the findings could have implications for improved performance in athletes, general health, and well-being in the rest of the population.\n\n[b][color=white]Neurobiological Origin of Attention-Deficit Disorder Confirmed[/color][/b]\nThe neurobiological origin of attention-deficit disorder (A.D.D.), a syndrome whose causes have largely been a mystery, has just been confirmed by a study carried out on mice. Researchers have identified a cerebral structure, the superior colliculus, where hyperstimulation causes behavior modifications similar to those of some patients who suffer from A.D.D. Their work also shows noradrenaline accumulation in the affected area, shedding light on this chemical mediator having a role in attention disorders. Attention-deficit disorder affects between 4-8% of children and manifests mainly through disturbed attention and verbal and motor impulsiveness, sometimes accompanied by hyperactivity. About 60% of these children still show symptoms in adulthood. The only effective treatment is to administer psycho-stimulants, but these have substantial side effects that can include addiction. Controversy has surrounded the origin of the disorder, hindering the progress of cures. Now that the origin has been found, research on finding a cure can finally begin.\n\n[b][color=white]New Self-Healing Plastics Developed[/color][/b]\nNew technology has created self-healing materials that can repair itself by restoring its initial molecular structure after some type of damage. Scientists of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Evonik Industries have developed a chemical cross-linking reaction that ensures good short-term healing properties of the material under mild heating. The K.I.T. group, headed by Christopher Barner-Kowollik, uses the possibility of cross-linking functioning fibers by a reversible chemical reaction for the production of self-healing materials. These switchable networks can be decomposed into their initial constituents and reassembled again after the damage. The self-healing mechanism can be initiated any time by heat, light or by the addition of a chemical substance.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/7zlNcBz.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Arresticle[/color][/b]\nA 17-year-old Irish schoolboy has been admitted to hospital after going into cardiac arrest. The reason? His testicles were squeezed too hard in a prank that went wrong. He was joking with friends while at school when another boy allegedly \"jerked his scrotum,\" causing the arresticle to occur. One of the kids in the group then informed a teacher who proceeded to perform CPR while emergency services arrived. The teen is said to be stable. It’s stories like this that remind us how lucky we are to have not had our testicles squeezed. \n\n[b][color=white]‘When Rape is Inevitable, Lie Back and Enjoy it’[/color][/b]\nThis comment made by councilor Barbara Driver, age 77, sparked outrage across the United Kingdom. The words were said during a council meeting, in which many council officials were present. She conceded that she was \"trying to put across-- quite badly, I must say-- the fact of developers having not put much social and affordable housing in and the council saying we can't do anything about it.\" Although her intentions may have been noble, the community outrage has resulted in Driver stepping down from her position in the Cheltenham Council.\n\n[b][color=white]Sale of Hitler’s Personal Effects[/color][/b]\nFrance’s main Jewish body has expressed its discomfort at the sale of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Air Force commander Hermann Goering's personal items. The CRIF has said that the sale is \"a form of moral indecency\"and that it is \"disrespect[ful] to the victims of Nazi barbarism.\" To name a few, some of the items that are up for sale include Goering’s passport and a monogrammed mat owned by Hitler. It is doubtful that the sale will be cancelled. Personally, I think the Jews need to get over it. Leave your thoughts in the box below.\n\n[b][color=white]Gay Clergyman's Act of Defiance[/color][/b]\nCanon Jeremy Pemberton was recently married to Laurence Cunnington. Why is this an issue? Canon Jeremy Pemberton is a senior Anglican clergyman; he was one of the many to take advantage of the UK's new laws regarding same-sex marriage. The move is considered as direct defiance towards the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Pemberton claimed \"I love this man and I want to be married to him.\" The Church’s stance of same-sex marriage is quite clear and Pemberton may face disciplinary action.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/qIhVVNQ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Sprint Customers Could Soon Get Discounts On Spotify[/b][/color]\nLately, we have been seeing music streaming services team up with carriers in order to save subscribers money; such is the case with the recent pairing of AT&T and Beats Music. AT&T will gain more competition if the rumors coming out about Sprint teaming up with Spotify are true. A well known tech outlet, Recode, claims that Sprint is going to be announcing a partnership with Spotify and will have discounts on the streaming service. According to the rumors, we will know more at an event on April 29th.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft Testing Live Tiles That You Can Use Without Leaving the Start Screen[/b][/color]\nMost people who have experienced Windows 8 would agree that Windows Live Tiles could be so much better than they are at the moment, especially on touch-enabled devices. According to reports, a team of Microsoft researchers based out of Asia have been working on making the tiles more interactive. These new tiles expand when touched, showing the contents on the right of the screen instead of launching into a new screen for an app. The time has also been working on a tile called Desktop Interactive Tile and this specific tile lists all the open applications on desktop mode for easier access to the programs. An example of the tiles use were shown when someone clicked on the mail app; it expanded and showed a list of received emails.

The NSA isn't in the news recently for some big spying ring or anything like that, but they are, however, in the news for the fact that they've been using the Heartbleed exploit to supposedly spy on sites and people for years. If you don't know about it yet, let's do a quick rundown of what it is. Heartbleed is a security exploit that plagues two-thirds of the web. This exploit has to do with OpenSSL and because it is so widely-used, the bug is found on many sites. The exploit itself is achieved by sending a well-disguised packet of data that looks like something the computer would normally get to trick it into sending data stored in its memory back to your end. According to the information available, the NSA has been using Heartbleed for two years without notifying the companies or the public. The NSA claims these accusations to be false, but have yet to show anything to help their case.\n\n[color=white][b]Let Me Google That For You, A New Senate Bill, May Be the Best Bill[/b][/color]\n\"Let me Google That For You\" has been a phrase uttered numerous times amongst coworkers and friends alike, but it now may become the best Senate bill in history. Two Senators, Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), have introduced the Let Me Google That For You Act of 2014 this past week. The bill itself will prioritize using the internet to find information about any topic. As of now, the government runs most of its searches through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and every time it runs a search, it costs the taxpayers' money. The costs of using the NTIS for such searches have boiled down to about $100 per question, when many of the questions and searches could've been ran through Google and completed in less than ten seconds. If the bill itself is approved, it would eliminate the NTIS and save everyone tons of money and time.\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/eXQx0Yx.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][i]*Being Replaced - Do not message me about it*\n\n~ If you wish to apply for Music News, post an application in this edition ~\n- Applications are a sample Music News article, containing three-to-four subjects -[/i][/align]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]",

This of course means that HF adds to what \nwas a rapidly expanding Cryptocurrency family with our Omnicoin, \nwhich seems more fun than currency, though due to it's localised \nnationality to HF, it may become a local form of currency. Though I \nwould love to see OmniCoin have a small value that can be freely \ntraded or redeemed, it seems that all AltCoins need a primary \ninvestor or purchaser to set a value.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1221375][i]-Ryuusei Cartwright[/i][/url]\n\n[align=right]-=-=-\n\n[i]\"I'm undoubtedly biased as the project lead on Omnicoin, but I'm \npleasantly surprised by the success it's had in its first days. It already \nhas a thriving economy, a dedicated team, and the support of Omni. \nThere will always be people who are skeptical of it, but the beauty of it, \nnot everyone is required to use it. It's an extension, a protocol layer on \ntop of HF's roots. I think it's a novel idea as well, to try and tie a currency \nto a singular community. I don't believe it's been attempted before in \nany significant capacity.\"[/i]\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1088934][i]-Crypto™[/i][/url][/align]\n\n-=-=-\n\nThe topic for next week is \"What's new?\"\n\n-=-\n\nTo send in your entries for the next edition, PM [url=http://goo.gl/FzyrO]Sir[/url].\n\n-=-=-\n-=-\n-\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/N7zf1is.png[/IMG]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/private.php?action=send&uid=1775114&subject=gallerysubmission][img]http://puu.sh/87F5V.png[/img][/url]\n[align=right][size=x-small][url=http://hackforums.net/private.php?action=send&uid=1775114&subject=gallerysubmission]Click here ^ or the gallery to send in artwork -=-[/url][/size][/align]\n\n[/align]\n\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vfJtB5T.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][size=large][color=white](1)[/color][/size][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/Yw0aMoy.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][size=large][color=white](2)[/color][/size][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/o40Vadb.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][size=large][color=white](3)[/color][/size][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/m5Rtlwd.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][size=large][color=white](4)[/color][/size][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/0f9ZBZS.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][size=large][color=white](5)[/color][/size][spoiler=][img]http://i.imgur.com/bvVqo3a.png[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[align=center][size=large][color=white](6)[/color][/size][spoiler=][img]http://37.media.tumblr.com/6ca44bac11e9f5cb14bb188aad92cd73/tumblr_n3vziioSEY1qhnegdo1_r1_500.jpg[/img][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/mvU7vPJ.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]HF News Team[/b][/color]\n[list][*][color=white][b]Publisher & Head Journalist[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url][/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Journalists[/b][/color]\n[list][*][url=http://goo.gl/4W9dI]Sir[/url]\n[list][*]Opinions\n[*]Sir's Second\n[*]Comics[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1082656]Mohatu[/url]\n[list][*]Headlines[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody[/url]\n[list][*]User News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112]Saturday[/url]\n[list][*]Group News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=891268]OnTheFly[/url]\n[list][*]Notable Threads[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=891000]RDCA[/url]\n[list][*]Security News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1088934]Crypto™[/url]\n[list][*]Currency News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1093501]Roger Waters[/url]\n[list][*]Gaming News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1108450]Baghead[/url]\n[list][*]Minecraft News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1171567]Chieftain[/url]\n[list][*]Scientific News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=944024]Neal Caffrey[/url]\n[list][*]World News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1079277]Harlem[/url]\n[list][*]Tech News[/list][/list]\n[list][*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=515249]*Replacing*[/url]\n[list][*]Music News[/list][/list]\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*][color=white][b]Interviewers[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878]Clique[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635]Clark[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403]630[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Graphical Editors[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1775114]Renium[/url]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=139340]Poseidon[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Reporter[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=524451]Yellows[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1172544]Cody[/url]\n[/list]\n[*][color=white][b]Proofreader[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1645227]Lovol[/url]\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[hr]\n[hr]",
