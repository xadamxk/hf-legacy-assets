This could be a problem for some members that do not regularly use Liberty Reserve however some members do offer currency exchange services just for this reason. In addition to that [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#4DD0FC][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has announced that anyone posting \"Any thanks appreciated\" will be repfucked for asking for reputation.

And whoever else I forgot.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][color=#0066FF][b]RDCA[/b][/color][/url]: I am sure they will be happy. So before we get into HF related things, I have to ask how is Spain? Do you enjoy it a lot?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1206954][b]Nickelodeon[/b][/url]: I didn't knew it would be so great actually, It's warm and great has alot of beatiful nature\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][color=#0066FF][b]RDCA[/b][/color][/url]: I always wanted to travel, I hope you enjoyed yourself. In a very short period of time, you have donated a lot of money to HF, which is perfectly fine. Though, do you think people have looked at you differently, or treated you differently because of it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1206954][b]Nickelodeon[/b][/url]: I am still donating even the fact that I got all the donation awards.\nYes, I guess people trust me more, they offer to go first in any deals without asking for it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][color=#0066FF][b]RDCA[/b][/color][/url]: Well, that shows shows the real reason you were donating.

If you could change one thing about the world what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1206954][b]Nickelodeon[/b][/url]: I would reopen the Human Manipulation and Social Engineering subforum.\nWell, this changes from the period, but currently I would make an end to the war in Syria.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=580684][color=#0066FF][b]RDCA[/b][/color][/url]: Alright, we are now coming to a close, do you have any final questions, comments, or concerns?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1206954][b]Nickelodeon[/b][/url]: I want to thank ₵ybeя for everything he did for me, he has been there for me since day 1 from my HF carreer.

But in the small city of Tehran, Iran, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake (the first one) hit at 4:53 p.m. Just 11 minutes after the horrific quake, another one hit just 30 miles northeast, this time with a magnitude of 6.3. So far authorities predicted there to be a total of 17 aftershocks. It has also been stated that at least 250 people were killed and nearly 2,000 others injured. Many people are suffering from lack of food and water from these disastrous quakes. Authorities have also sent out rescue teams in the area.\n\n[color=white][b]Olympics[/b][/color]\nThe Olympics is quite an outstanding view of our worlds goals and accomplishments. It is currently Day 15 for our fellow Olympians and it's a bit hard not to notice the USA. Micheal Phelps has literally set an overall Olympic record for receiving the most gold medals. EIGHTEEN! USA is currently in first, followed by China, and right behind China is Russia. We'll see how it plays out! Day 16, here we come!\n\n[color=white][b]Gay Chick-Fil-A?[/b][/color]\nChick-Fil-A is a well known food chain that is notorious for its chicken sandwiches. Well, recently they have been a main supporter of the whole \"Anti-Gay\" movement. Last Wednesday they held an event known as, \"Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day.\" The is pretty much an event that hates on gays. In fact, a gay 24 year-old that has been working at the North Carolina Chick-Fil-A for years now calls it, \"Hater appreciation day.\" Kind of makes sense....\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbnJDqXKVJiOjS.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Google[/b][/color]\nOn the Google's blog, Google has outlined a new antipiracy scheme that would penalize the sites which contains more copyright flags. Google said that these sites will be lowered in search rankings.

Users have been receiving an error message \"mail service imap.gmail.com is not responding\" when trying to login. Fortunately, Google has been made aware of this issue and is working to fix it. Meanwhile, iPhone 5's battery photo got leaked and it has been said that it'll have a capacity of 1440 mAh, which is higher than the iPhone 4S' and iPhone 4's battery.\n\n[color=white][b]Microsoft[/b][/color]\nMicrosoft has decided to switch to the name from \"Windows 8\" to \"Metro,\" with it's European partner. So this is how it'll go, \"Windows 8 app\" to \"Metro app\", \"Windows 8 design\" to \"Metro Design\" and so on. Microsoft said that \"Metro is our design language. We call it Metro becase it's modern and clean. It's fast and in motion. It's about content and typography. And it's entirely authentic.\n\n[color=white][b]Battle.net[/b][/color]\nBlizzard Entertainment's (Company behind World Of Warcraft and Diablo) internal security was compromised last week and the hackers have taken non-china battle.net's players' emails. However, the company said that their cryptography method is very tough and unique so that the hackers can't crack them so easily. They urged the other users to change their passwords immediately. In addition, the company has also added a security question, mobile checking, and also dial-in authentication to tighten the security.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbjo5C8ZAaCfSc.png[/img][/align]\n[color=white][b]Nicki Minaj's Free NYC Show Set For Aug. 14[/b][/color]\nNicki Minaj is doing something for her fans by performing a free show. She is doing this because she did not perform at the Hot 97 Summer Jam in June. The free concert will be at the Roseland Ballroom on Aug. 14th and will  be sponsored by Pepsi. This is the same day that Nicki Minah will be on the Today Show. The first 1,500 fans to line up outside the venue after 12:00 p.m. will be granted free admission to the show.

With these two, anything below a gold medal is a loss. While other countries, are ecstatic to place at all, and support their athletes no matter what. We've (USA) come to expect the best from our athletes, and don't accept anything less. We really should be glad that the best the world has to offer, are all together in one place. They are better than almost anyone judging them, yet they judge them with a grain of salt. Ridiculous, in my opinion.",

They claim to \nbe an original group that will help other members, but the last I heard that was already done \nby a handful of other groups. The Empire on the other hand, is an all-around group.
