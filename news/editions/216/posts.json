MRT (Malware Removal Team) was a group focused on malware removal and during their time they helped members upon members with their problems whether they were infections or just check-ups. On September 10th, 2014 [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=827711][color=#EFEFEF][b]D3xus[/b][/color][/url] posted a thread about the MRT forum posting restrictions which can be found, [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4440528]here[/url]. A month or so later after the thread was revived, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made a post stating that he thinks people take the section too seriously, he doesn't like the fact that they want to operate as a private group subforum seeing there is no communal benefit from that, and also doesn't like the fact of how long it's taking to train members. Later on [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] made another post stating that he thinks there's something wrong if the training takes a year, he then followed up in that post claiming he was going to delete the group later that night and well, he did. Those two posts can be found [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4440528&pid=43508580#pid43508580]here[/url], and [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4440528&pid=43509272#pid43509272]here[/url].

Originally, you were only able to use the feature if you were an EP1C + UB3R member, however now [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] has made it so L33T members will be able to use it as well as this should greatly increase its usage for the forum. [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][color=#FF66FF][b]Omniscient[/b][/color][/url] stated that he will be continuing to add features to the HF IM so he can eventually integrate it into HF for things such as options for profile data and statistics.

that was surprising, and yet unsurprising at the same time, Omniscient has closed the Malware Removal Team and it's child group, the Malware Removal Team Trainees. His rationale in closing the group was that the group had failed to grow after the special modifications Omniscient had made for the group, and that it was more restrictive, rather than \"educative\". \n\n[quote='Omniscient' pid='43515841']\nMRT has struggled to grow their group. It was 9 members. A difference of opinion had evolved where I wanted the group to be more educative and they wanted the group to be more restrictive. They've simply failed at making MRT something unique and it was nothing more than a clone of other malware removal websites. That's just not good enough for me. I didn't create the group for a select few with an elitist attitude. I created it hoping members would learn. Learn they did not. So with that mission failing the group is deleted.\n[/quote]\n\nIn addition to the groups being closed, their group subforum was junked, and all posts in the Malware Removal Help forum were moved into what was formerly the White Hat Help forum. Said forum was renamed to the [b]White Hat Malware, Virus, and Rat Removal Help[/b] forum. The original Malware Removal Help forum was then deleted.\n\nYou can view Omniscient's full comment on his deletion of the group [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=4555769][b]here[/b][/url].\n\n[b][color=white]The Curtain Rises on Nightfall[/color][/b]\nAs one group closes, another group changes gears. The group formerly known as [i]Instinct[/i] has completed a change into [i]Nightfall[/i], a new gaming group on the forum. Whereas Instinct was a more laid-back and relaxed community, Nightfall aims to be a more private and focused center for gaming of all sorts. Additionally, the Nightfall group subforum will have two private subforums for Console and PC Gaming, so as to better cater to the different types of video games.\n\n[quote='Vinnie' pid='43513309']Nightfall is the upgrade to Instinct, it's nice to see changes but seeing evolution is even better, we've switched from being a group to becoming an active gaming community, a private community and this goes to all games and all genres[/quote]\n\nThis will mark the fifth iteration of the original group, [i]Eminence[/i], oh so long ago.

Any shout-outs you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Well to you 630, my favorite alcoholic, TheCause, along with the worst ADC I've ever seen, Slash6992, and what was that one lads name that was missing the arms and liked a certain flower....ah..Cody, how silly of me to forget, yep those are my shoutouts ^o^\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Oh TheCause... It has been a while, how are you, what's new?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Indeed it has, hope you've been doing good as I hope is the same with your studies, probably very busy haha, not much is new with me, I'm still drawing my furry art/comics and I'm currently planning to fly to a few places, maybe Spain around Christmas and a few others, fun times with planning places to travel.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] When are you coming to Chicago? Any conventions coming up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Sadly that Furry convention has already expired, along with the plane ticket my boss bought me, still would rather not meet my fans in real life which is why I avoided that convention, the situation would be a bit too awkward, I'd consider visiting you, but that would probably be around summer, I'd be too interested in trying to snowboard and probably fly off a mountain to my death or something super dumb like that.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So I heard you're back in the Hacker Craft game, how has the server been?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] I'll be honest, I sorta wanted to avoid it because I felt like all my previous trials with it ate a couple of months off my lifespan which really started hitting me hard right before you prepped the last nail in the coffin, so thanks for that too btw, at first the server struggled incredibly and everyone was under the idea it was RobustCraft, I tried lending a few suggestions to fix it because while at the time I had no interest because I'd like to live past the age of 40, a couple of friends really wanted to see it thrive again and after a few suggestions were a bit hard to meet, but had a lot of interest, I worked out an agreement with Robust and became Admin. It's actually quite nice because now there are no strings on me and I'm free to finally give HackerCraft the brush-ups it really needed, most notably we're bringing back the real Faction/PVP stuff and dumping the \"OBEY HC AWARD AND FARM\" design that always seemed to poison it slowly, players can now sell all sorts of things and I'm working with Robust and Froggy to give HackerCraft a new design this time around and things are just getting good.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So are you staff on the server? I saw that you were doing some more builds, what's your technical role?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Well I'm an Admin now along with Froggy and Robust is the owner, I'm here to discuss and help make decisions on HackerCraft to get it going in the right direction along with Froggy and basically the Admins do everything currently, we build, moderate, and talk over new ideas and reasonable suggestions, shockingly it's easier with the less people involved, 3 opinions is much easier to sort through and it's nice to speak with people that give reasonable feedback instead of \"Well no that is dumb\", they actually give well thought out responses and that's nice, it's much better than my old times as a moderator trying to talk any sense to Mr.Smiles and his deaf personality.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Admin? Jeez, never knew that. Outside of the award, what are the goals for the server?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] At first it was to bring back a nostalgic feel that everyone wanted and for a while that seemed like the right direction, but all the nostalgia nuts are either long gone or they have different opinions of which version was the best, we decided that it would be best to completely scrap the original design Omniscient had and just wing it, it's not all random, we have a lot planned for it, but we're done trying to revive the dead, it's time it moves into something new because nostalgia can be very biased and it was killing a good 60% player count because the \"old\" ways didn't make any sense, especially lacking the award which could be earned, sorta like trying to showcase the sun while it's dark outside. We decided that these old flip and spin techniques with the design Omniscient had were not the right path anymore and we're modeling it into something very interesting, honestly I'm excited for the changes coming, I'm sure it will shock everyone ^o^\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] How has activity been lately? I joined a few nights ago and it wasn't that good and decided to leave. Do you guys plan on promoting the server and branching out past Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Activity died out the past few days since we had announced a very likely economy reset that could (Did) happen and everyone pouted and left, normally it's around 30-50 players on during most of the day, around nighttime it drops to 10-20, players hated the changes, but the old economy was terribly flawed thanks to a few exploits and that gave HackerCraft a terrible rocky start, but we're sailing smooth so far and we hope to keep it going. Far as it goes promoting the server past Hack Forums, that was more of a secret I was saving, I'm great at mass advertisement and I had quite a few tricks up my sleeve to get new players from an abundance of different sources, we're hammering out a few kinks and getting ready for a massive overhaul that only staff will know of for a month or two, once that's out of the way we plan to spread our wings and hopefully leave the beta stages for good.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I know one thing that members complained about was the server lag, has this problem been fixed?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] I haven't seen any real lag since Robust took over, the only issue I occasionally see is a few permissions that need to be fixed, but they're a simple minute job, we've just been so busy discussing new ideas that we forget occasionally, we'll be knocking all those out very soon though. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well that's a relief. So how do you feel about Hack Forum's recent introduction of XMPP? Do you plan on using it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly I've been so slapped with real life stuff that I've been in lala land towards Hack Forums, probably won't use that though.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] I like the idea, but won't personally use it. So if you could change one thing on Hack Forums what would it be?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] I like how Hack Forums is, not anything I would change.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] So Instinct made its recent change to Nightfall, what's in store for us? How do you feel about the recent changes?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly it seems the same to me, with the except of a new revamp of interest in different forms of gaming, I personally like that, while Instinct was fun for the wacky relaxed image it portrayed, this still has it, but also caters a bit more seriously to games which is very nice, I like reading about that kind of stuff, especially when you feel like me and you think you're just losing touch sometimes, very refreshing.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=797403][color=#22C997][b]630:[/b][/color][/url] Well I think that's all the time we have for this interview. Are there any concluding remarks you'd like to make?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=417076][color=#EFEFEF][b]Reset:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you for your kind gesture of interviewing this lame person named Reset and I hope you and your family had a lovely Thanksgiving and Happy Holidays if we don't talk much until then, to all the shout-outs, the same goes for you all as well too. ~Sincerely, Reset ^o^\n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245]zSerity[/url][/font][/size][spoiler=]\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Welcome to the 216th edition of the HF news!

It wasn't until around 4 or so months ago that I actually started to become active in the community.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] So you've been here a while, huh? What caused you to stick around?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Well like I said I created my account back in 2012, but I actually didn't really start using it until this August/September, so I don't really think of myself as being around for awhile. But so far I've stuck around for the last 4 months mostly because of the people I've met, and of course the business opportunities.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] What sort of business? Do you sell a product or service on HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Currently I run a homework service. However I'm thinking about hiring a coder soon to create a product I think the community will like. :)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Sounds interesting, any details on it?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I don't want to give it away incase someone steals the idea, but it has to do with social media sites.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] No biggie, I'll be on the lookout. So what do you do outside of HF?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Honestly I use to game a lot, and play world of warcraft - but I haven't really been doing anything else on the computer besides hack forums. As for things outside of the virtual world I've just been going to school and working out. Nothing too exciting.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Gaming you say? Are you an Xbox or PlayStation gamer? Or a PC kid?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Mostly PC, world of warcraft, cs:go, the forest, watch dogs. But I'm thinking about buying a next gen console this black friday.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Me too, I wanted to pick up the Xbox One. Any idea which one you're getting?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I tried asking around on hack forums, I'm pretty much getting recommendations for both about 50/50, people say the ps4 has better graphics, but the xbox one is a lot more fun. I'm a sony fanboy so if I do get one it'll probably be the ps4.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url]Yeah, there will always be the argument over which console is better. Speaking of gaming, what do you think of that new group, Nightfall? Looks like a new and improved version of Instinct to me.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah I'm actually in Nightfall, it's definitely new and improved with that sexy new userbar and sub forums.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Definitely, I can't wait to see what Vinnie has planned out. Since we're on the subject of groups, how do you feel about all these changes? The revamp for Zero, group reset for L'appel du Vide and the Brotherhood, Nightfall, etc.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I'm not really sure how I think about Zero, as I've never really been in or interacted with the group, as for L'appel the change was good, there definitely isn't as many LQ members in it as there was before. Nightfall was definitely an improvement with the sub forums. As for brotherhood it's pretty much the same feels as zero.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Interesting. How would you run a group if you got to be an owner?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] I'd make my group specific to a certain niche, not just \"business and marketing\" for example, a vices group, or fitness group, etc.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] That would certainly make a refreshing change, hopefully we'll see it in the future. So I hear you're Canadian, eh? How do you like it up there?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Lmao yes. I love Canada. I actually love where I live in Canada because it's really close to the American border so I can go over there shopping a lot (cheaper taxes and prices) I actually just got back from early black friday shopping.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1958081][color=#70B8FF][b] Justin Timberlake:[/b][/color][/url] Nice, I might go shopping myself sometime soon. Anything you'd like to say before we conclude?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1327245][color=white][b]zSerity:[/b][/color][/url] Hmm not really, thanks for taking the time to interview me, shoutout to all my fellow HFNT members.

However, while it is usually the PlayStation network that is targeted, this time it was Sony Pictures Entertainment itself. Sources say that the company’s computers in New York and all around the world were breached by the cyber criminals. The hackers are said to have first displayed pictures of weird skeletons, and then an abundance of out-of-the-ordinary URLs. The hackers then proceed to display this following threatening message:\n[i]\"Hacked By #GOP Warning: We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met. We've obtained all your internal data, including your secrets and top secrets. If you don't obey us, we'll release data shown below to the world. Determine what will you do till November the 24th, 11:00 PM (GMT).\" - thehackernews.com[/i]\nThe hacker group ended their fun by leaking a large data folder containing documents from Sony. We wish you luck Sony, hopefully you can secure your systems one of these days. \n\n[b][color=white]Adobe Releases Emergency Flash Player Update to Address Critical Vulnerability[/color][/b]\nAdobe has recently released an important statement urging its users to download Adobe's newest update, as the previous version has a critical vulnerability in its widely used flash player software, which is being currently abused by hackers. This applies to all operating systems including Windows, Mac, and Linux. \n[i]\"The vulnerability is being exploited in blind mass attack. No doubt about it: the team behind Angler is really good at what it does,\" - malware.dontneedcoffee.com[/i]\nIt is said that Google will also soon be releasing a crucial update for the widely used Google Chrome, which will fix the vulnerability in the flash player plugin. If you are currently a user of flash player, it is recommended that you update to the latest version as soon as possible.\n\n[b][color=white]Syrian Electronic Army Hacks UK based Media Websites[/color][/b]\nThe infamous Syrian Electronic Army Group (SEA) has yet again gained a wide amount of interest from media sources due to breaking into an array of popular news websites. While they did not steal anything valuable from these websites, or take them down, they did however display thanksgiving popups which let people know that the website had been compromised. The sites that were compromised include: [i]The Forbes, The Independent, The Chicago Tribune, The Daily Telegraph, The London Evening Standard, broadcaster CNBC, PC World and the US National Hockey League (site information gained from thehackernews.com).[/i] Even though the visitors of the site were not hacked themselves, they were displayed a popup through their JavaScript that informed them that they had been hacked by the group, which in turn frightened a lot of people. Tis the season to be hacking, I suppose.\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/PLhFUIV.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1339278]Paragon[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1500602]Bonfire.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Non-English Speaking Regions Getting “Regin’d” [/color][/b]\nSaid to have been in “circulation” for around 6 years, one particular covert piece of malware dubbed “Regin” has been spying on users, businesses, and governments. Although it has been known to target entities that do not speak the English language, it is still a threat to international companies and foreign governments. With intent for espionage, Regin targets communications and lets free “5 layers of attack”, decrypting and executing each to gain illicit access to a multitude of services.  The security and software advocate Symantec classifies Regin as “top-tier espionage tool”, capable of performing a myriad of different activities, hell-bent on either harm or profit.\n\n[b][color=white]The Uber App Is Uber Nosey [/color][/b]\nYou may have heard of the newly popularized “taxi” service “Uber”, or perhaps its rival ride-sharing service, “Lyft”, but it is for certain that “Uber” has heard of you, that is if you let them. Numerous allegations by Android security companies have stated that Uber’s Android application collects more information about its users than it knows what to do with. Collecting user email, calling information, WiFi information, and for some odd reason, information about your phone's battery. With users and collectives tagging on names to the app such as “malware”, and pressure on Google to take the app down from the Play Store, the applications future doesn’t look so bright.\n\n[b][color=white]No Tobacco. Just Malware. [/color][/b]\nAfter a large increase seen in what security enthusiasts call “autorun malware”, that being malware that is automatically run by a target machine be it through a USB or a similar device, one story tells a tale about an e-cigarette being “laced” with malware. Now don’t go off on some tangent about how you can’t inhale malware, the malware supposedly resided in the charger of the “e-cig” and not in the cigarette itself. While the happening may only be something out of a “vapers” worst nightmare, the threat is as real as ever with newly crafted techniques to infect targeted machines. Devices like the USB Rubber Ducky and the aforementioned types of malware capitalize on autorun features and are exhuming the threat that autorun could possibly be synonymous with “autopwn”.\n\n[b][color=white]Anti Virus Programs for Mac Are Being Tested[/color][/b]\nMany Mac users have a false sense of security when it comes to malware - they are under the impression that they are completely safe from all types of viruses. Sadly that isn't true, even though the number of Mac threats is significantly lower when compared to threats targeting Windows machines, there are still a few pieces of malware that have infected a large number of Apple devices. A total of 18 different AV programs were tested. The top three scoring programs were Bit Defender, G Data and Norman finding 100% of malware on the machine. The other 15 programs only detected about 85% of the problems on the machine, leaving room for various unwanted viruses.  \n\n[b][color=white]New Credit Card Technology Being Implemented[/color][/b]\nA long awaited credit card technology is finally coming soon, this new technology will increase security with credit cards while also decreasing the likelihood of fraud or theft. Before, users would swipe their card with a magnetic strip through a scanner. Any retailers using the magnetic strip after October 2015 will be liable for fraudulent purchases. Many of the major Credit card companies did not want to upgrade their cards primarily because of the pretty penny that comes along with these cards. Various retailers also did not want to upgrade their systems, again because of the cost associated with it.  \n\n[b][color=white]Google Security Dashboard Being Released[/color][/b]\nGoogle has just released a new type of dashboard allowing users to see all activity on their devices within the past 28 days. Users are capable of seeing when the device was last used and where it was used, and when a user clicks on the device, it brings up more detail about where it was used with the exact date and time. This new feature will help all everyone with a Google account secure their accounts better and make sure their account isn't being spied on by unwanted third parties. If a user notices any suspicious activity, they are able to immediately change their password right within the dashboard. \n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/CYMi3Zj.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=692131]Anima Libera[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1754121]Grievous[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left]\n\n[b][color=white]Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Exo Zombies Trailer[/color][/b]\nSome might say that the newest edition of the Call of Duty series, Advanced Warfare was worth the money, while others might not think so. Well, if you're a fan or not, this game has brought something to the table fans will enjoy. Zombies! Yes, you heard that right. Zombies is going to be added to Advanced Warfare. The DLC will most likely be available to the public sometime next year. In addition, the Zombies mode will be something new. In the official trailer that is 79 seconds long, which can be seen [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGVxcwdqqAg]here[/url], it states that the Zombies will be \"Exo Zombies\". Spooky!\n\n[b][color=white]Matchmaking Patch for Halo: MCC Released[/color][/b]\nYet again, another patch for the newest Halo game, Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Recent issues regarding the game have been occurring for those trying to play online. 343 has been working their hardest to resolve these issues and get everything back online for players to enjoy. Things such as errors, glitches, and various different bugs have been reported to the developers and this patch has been released to supposedly fix the errors. With the file size of 523MB, 343 says the patch will hopefully improve gameplay and the stability of everything. This patch has been said to fix most, and if not all the issues that are troubling players. Of course this will not fix everything, 343 states, and more patches will be released overtime.\n\n[b][color=white]Free DLC for AC: U Players[/color][/b]\nWith an unstable release, Assassin's Creed: Unity developers over in Ubisoft are giving early Christmas gifts, so to speak to players who currently own the game. Dead kings, the very first expansion pack for AC: U can be obtained for free. If you've purchased the DLC pass, you will have the option to obtain a free game that Ubisoft has to offer, which includes the following:\n[list][*][url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassin-s-creed-unity-players-will-get-free-dlc-i/1100-6423844/]Credits to Gamespot for the List[/url]\n[list]\n[*]The Crew\n[*]Far Cry 4\n[*]Watch Dogs\n[*]Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag\n[*]Rayman Legends\n[*]Just Dance 2015[/list][/list]\n\nPretty cool, no? At the current time the devs are working on a way to make it easy for you, as well as Ubisoft to pick the game you'd like for free. No details have been released on the system stated above. With all of this info shared, in addition, new patches will be released that will improve the quality and make your gameplay fun and enjoyable.\n\n[b][color=white]Release Dates for the Week of November 28, 2014:[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*]Tales From the Borderlands Episode 1: Zer0 Sum - Playstation 3 & 4, Xbox One & 360 - November 25, 2014\n[*]Aqua Kitty DX - Playstation 4 & Playstation VITA - November 25, 2014\n[*]Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth - Nintendo 3DS - November 25th, 2014\n[*]Raven's Cry - PC & Mac - November 27, 2014\n[*]Little Big Planet 3 - Playstation 3 & 4 - November 28, 2014\n[*]Amiibo - Nintendo Wii-U - November 28, 2014[/align]\n[/list]\n\n[sp=Gaming Video of the Week]\n[yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtaCbLxs4bk[/yt]\n[/align]\n[/sp][/spoiler]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.imgur.com/z4euGys.png[/img][/align]\n\n[align=center][b]By [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1698590]Abide[/url] & [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=649674]Eternal.[/url][/b][/align]\n[align=center][spoiler=][align=left] \n\n[b][color=white]GoPro To Make Camera Equipped Drones[/color][/b]\nGoPro has decided to enter the drone market according to The Wall Street Journal. The drones will feature different qualities of its GoPro camera series, and will be more producing middle to high end civilian drones between the price point of $500 and $1000. This will likely end ties with current drone manufacturers, however entering the drone market seems a very smart marketing choice for the active camera creators that can go anywhere.\n\n[b][color=white]European Union Deems Google A Monopoly, Calls On European Commission To Break Off Search[/color][/b]\nThe European Union believes that Google is a monopoly that threatens net neutrality, and they have voted to call upon the European commission to split Google services from their search engine. The vote to break up Google was passed with 384 votes to break off the search engine, 174 not to and 56 abstentions. This ruling would not only effect Google however, it would effect all search engines who also have other commercial interests. Google hasn't commented on the matter yet, and it hasn't been passed by the European Commission so the result is not clear on if and how this would even be implemented. \n\n[b][color=white]Nintendo Patents Game Boy Emulators For Future Technology [/color][/b]\nNintendo has recently acquired a patent on the emulation technology of its own system, the Game Boy. While not an entirely new concept as Nintendo has done this in the past, they recently added in a patent for specific emulation that would allow Nintendo products to be used on portable devices such as smartphones, tablets and more. While this patent will make all other emulators technically illegal, a Nintendo backed emulator seems a promising idea, especially since Apple doesn't allow Nintendo emulators on its App Store. This could a smart move by Nintendo in the ever growing smartphone world, and hopefully we can see some Nintendo backed emulators soon. \n\n[b][color=white]Razer's Nabu Wristband[/color][/b]\nThe new smart wristband Razer has been talking about for a long time has finally received a release date. On December 2nd you will be able to purchase the high-tech wristband. The \"Nabu\" wristband has a hybrid activity tracker and some other unique smart-watch features. There are supposedly going to be social network features not seen in any other device. For all you Razer Blade owners, you can also sync the wristband for advanced tracking statistics. However, because of Razer's long wait, competitors like Fitbit might end up controlling the market.\n\n[b][color=white]Twitter Tracks What Apps You Use[/color][/b]\nThat's right, Twitter wants to expand their advertising methods. In order for them to target adds properly, Twitter will now track which apps you use on your phone. This is a huge privacy breach to many, but Twitter says the data is private and only used for advertising and that they will not sell the data to other companies. In order to prevent this privacy breach, there are a few third party Twitter clients available for both iOS and Android. There is no word on whether or not you can disable this on the official app, but it makes people realize how corporations are finding more and more invasive methods to advertise.\n\n[b][color=white]OMSignal's Biometric Smart-Shirt[/color][/b]\nSmart fabric is a rising trend right now. Multiple fashion designs are attempting to blend fashion and technology together. A popular alternative to a smart-watch is OMsignal's biometric smart-shirt. The smart-shirt has fitness tracking capabilities like heart rate monitoring. Respiratory monitoring, and even a step counter. The smart-shirt has a sporty look, and it conforms to your chest to fit comfortably, and it is perfect to wear when working out. The material can also breathe and is extremely lightweight. \n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]space[/color]",
