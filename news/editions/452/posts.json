Honey tracks your private shopping behavior, collects data like your order history and items saved, and can read or change any of your data on any website you visit. To keep your data private and secure, uninstall this extension immediately.” The founders of Honey have issued a letter explaining how they are using your data, they are not selling your data, and a new privacy policy is coming into effect. In November 2019, PayPal bought the extension for $4 billion, so why did Amazon label the extension as a security risk many customers asked. Amazon declined to state why, they notified their customers of this alleged security risk.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059083/amazon-honey-browser-extension-security-risk-paypal-acquisition-competition] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[b][color=white]5G on its way to Laptops [/color][/b]\nThis year, 5G will now be coming to laptops this year.

The U.S. District Court in California, and the International Trade Commission has received two complaints. Sonos states, “actions have caused significant damage to Sonos,” Google denies this statement “We dispute these claims and will them vigorously.” Sonos and Google began working together in 2013, with Google adding the functionality of Google Play music into Sonos speakers. Sonos said that during this time, Google had a “wide aperture through which to view Sonos's proprietary technology,” Only two years later, Google released Chromecast Audio. Over the past three years, Sonos has been fighting against Google, “Over the years, we have had numerous ongoing conversations with Sonos about both companies’ IP rights and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith,” a Google spokesperson said. Sonos has filed many other lawsuits against Google and is concerned about how Google markets its speakers and uses them.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/tech/sonos-google-smart-speaker-lawsuit/index.html] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=682909][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/businessnews-bear.png[/img][/url][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Taking Stock of the Boeing Crash and Iran Missile Attack[/color][/b] \nThe crash of the Boeing 737-800 jet at Tehran has imposed potential problems to an already existing crisis for Boeing. The shares for the company reduced by 2 percent in market trading after the catastrophic crash killing 176 people. The Iranian government reported that the pilot lost control of the plane as the operators of the jet, Ukraine International Airlines, confirmed that the plane was serviced on Monday. Investors were alarmed by the recent US attacks on Iran killing the leader of Tehran’s Quds Force, Qassim Suleimani. The prices of Brent crude oil skyrocketed to $71.75 before retailing at $68.60. President Donald Trump calmed down the fears while Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister confirmed they were not seeking war.

On Wednesday, the institution released the economic outlook forecasting a 2.5% growth from the 2.4% experienced in 2019. Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, the Vice President of the World Bank, predicted risks on investment and trade which are contribute to growth. A 1.8% growth in GDP is expected in the US in 2020 from the 2.3% experienced in 2019. China is expected to increase its economy by 5.9% this year and 5.8 in 2021. Other emerging economies such as Argentina, Brazil and India are predicted to increase their economies by 4.1% this year.

A 5% increase in the stocks of Tesla translated to a record $492.14 per share and improved the market capitalization to approximately $89 billion. The good news is attributed to the efforts by Elon Musk, the Chief Executive of Tesla. GM and Ford sold over 2 million vehicles each in the US as Tesla delivered 367,500 vehicles last year. However, many investors and analysts are pessimistic about Tesla’s ability to maintain success as it has failed to meet targets in recent years. Mainstream automakers such as Volkswagen AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG are on the forefront in producing electric cars to compete with Tesla models.

But we now have an official announcement from January 4th that the 87-page one-shot will be published in the next issue, which goes on sale February 4th. The one-shot has been teased to feature Ryuk’s Death Note once again, falling to Earth after the events of the original manga.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/01/04/new-death-note-manga-chapter-in-12-years-to-be-published-in-februarys-jump-sq]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\n\n[color=transparent]   [/color][/size][/font]",

There is still a lingering intensity, and this can relate to a key issue you’re dealing with. The sun aligns with sobering Saturn and volcanic Pluto on Monday, and this can bring a greater understanding of the core issues and what you need to do to create the changes you desire. \r\n\r\nBut there is a spiritual component, too, as lovely Venus enters Pisces, and this can encourage you to turn the matter over to a higher power. If it really is too complex for you to handle, hand it over to the force of life, and you may find that help does come in the perfect way at the right time. \r\n\r\nFrom midweek, the influence of restless Uranus comes into play, and this could see you craving experiences that take you out of your comfort zone.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"To create the future you want, you might need to let go of whatever is stopping you from getting there. Last week, you may have become aware of what this is, and this week the conjunction of the sun with prudent Saturn and intense Pluto could inspire you further. If you need help from a teacher or life coach, do get it, because it could make a world of difference. \r\n\r\nWith luscious Venus, your guide planet, moving into Pisces and your social zone on Monday, you might be ready to confide in friends and accept their support. \r\n\r\nLively Mercury moves into your sector of career and ambition on Thursday. Its convivial presence here could see you reaching out to others for help and advice. But this is also a good time to network with those who share your goals or are on the same professional wavelength. \r\n\r\nFinally, an edgy Mercury-Uranus angle over the weekend could see you rebelling against something you don’t want to do.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With an intense set of planets in a deeply emotional zone, it would be no surprise if you felt a tad exhausted. And yet, you could feel a sense of relief at letting something go that really needed to leave your life. While you may have fought against this, you now might appreciate the wisdom of this release and the healing that can happen as a result. \r\n\r\nAs the sun links with taskmaster Saturn and radical Pluto on Monday, the awareness that everything is happening for a reason can give you strength and courage. \r\n\r\nCharming Venus enters your sector of goals and career on Monday, though, and her presence here can help smooth the way when negotiating or doing deals. If you feel motivated to connect socially with certain people, this could be a good move. \r\n\r\nChatty Mercury enters Aquarius and your sector of travel and far horizons on Thursday, so if you feel a restless urge to get out and about, go for it.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=3]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3399ff]Cancer ♋[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Last week’s intense energies may continue to linger. However, by the weekend you could feel a little lighter and easier within. The sun’s link to cautious Saturn and transformative Pluto on Monday can bring a sense of closure to a relationship issue that has been going on for a while. \r\n\r\nAlthough there may be details to finalize and further discussions in the pipeline, there may also be a sense of freedom and release. This doesn’t mean that a key bond is going to end, but rather that an issue may be on the verge of being resolved, and this could take things to a new level. \r\n\r\nLuscious Venus moves into your travel sector, though, so you may feel a yearning to get away from it all. If so, a trip could do you a world of good. \r\n\r\nHowever, Mercury’s move into Aquarius and your sector of shared assets on Thursday could be a call to get your finances organized for your peace of mind. The weekend could see you splurging, though, so go easy.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Positive Jupiter is now in your lifestyle sector until late next year, and its presence here can add extra buoyancy and confidence. This is just as well, because last week’s intense energies may have left you wondering what your next steps should be. \r\n\r\n Solar ties at the start of the week could see you assessing your priorities and creating a plan. Be sure to delegate, too, because this can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed when the pressure is on. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, luscious Venus moves into Pisces and a more emotional zone, which could enhance the romance in a key relationship. This can be a call to greater intimacy, and you could grow closer over the coming weeks. \r\n\r\nYour social life sparkles with promise, too, as upbeat Mercury moves into Aquarius on Thursday, encouraging you to get involved in activities that are a little bit different. \r\n\r\nFinally, if someone makes an exciting offer over the weekend, go easy because it could backfire.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=5]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#339933]Virgo ♍[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Are you ready to express your creativity? After last week’s focused and intense aspects, your perspective on self-expression and creativity may have shifted a little. This week, the sun conjoins sobering Saturn and transformative Pluto early on, encouraging you to find the silver lining to any issues you may have encountered. Whatever disappointments you’ve had, something can come out of this that benefits you greatly. \r\n\r\nDo you need to talk things over? As sweet Venus moves into your sector of relating on Monday, her presence here can encourage you to share how you feel with loved ones and friends. If you’re usually reserved, this can help unburden you and leave you feeling lighter and brighter. Plus, your social life can sparkle with additional promise. \r\n\r\nThoughtful Mercury, your ruler, moves into your lifestyle sector on Thursday, encouraging you to get organized. This is one of the better times to look to your routines and jettison any that no longer work for you.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Last week’s intense focus on your domestic sector could linger into this week, but you may feel generally lighter by the weekend. With the sun merging with prudent Saturn and potent Pluto on Monday, an opportunity could arise to resolve a family or domestic difficulty for good. \r\n\r\nIf last week encouraged you to seek change, this week could see you putting this desire into action. And, step by step, you will begin to see a positive shift. \r\n\r\nYour ruler Venus moves into your lifestyle zone on Monday, and this can be an opportunity for some well-deserved pampering and soothing treatments. If you need a massage or you’re eager to enjoy a spa day, go for it. \r\n\r\nConvivial Mercury’s move into your leisure zone on Thursday could see you connecting with others who share your interests. If you enjoy cultural activities, this is a great time to go to exhibitions, concerts, and other similar events.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Your mind holds the secret to success, and where you place your attention can be the key to moving up the ladder or taking a step back. Last week, the intense focus on your sector of talk and thought may have made you aware of the need to change your mindset. \r\n\r\nThe sun links to taskmaster Saturn and underworld Pluto on Monday, and you may now understand why this is so valuable. Even a small shift in attitude can bring positive results in your experience. Once you get a taste of how this works, you can then master your destiny. \r\n\r\nCould romance be in the air? With delectable Venus moving into your romance sector on Monday, this dreamy influence could see you eager to break the ice. This sensitive energy can make it easier to connect with others because you can tune in to their moods and feelings and get a sense of what motivates them. \r\n\r\nFinally, do you need to get organized at home? Mercury’s presence in Aquarius starting on Thursday can help with this.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"Positive Jupiter, your guide planet, is presently in your money zone and will be until late next year, so you have good fortune on your side. Still, it might not have seemed like this last week if intense energies coincided with a deep realization that something needs to shift. This may have been going on for some while, but now is the time for action rather than reflection. \r\n\r\nStill, with lovely Venus moving into your home zone on Monday, her presence here could encourage you to nurture yourself and enjoy a little pampering. If you feel like beautifying your surroundings in a creative way, this is very much the time to do so. \r\n\r\nChatty Mercury moves into your sector of communication on Thursday, and this can be a call to network and generally connect with those who may be of help to you. Are you ready to launch a website, blog, or online business? This can be a good time to start.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=9]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#663333]Capricorn ♑[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"If you were under intense pressure last week, this can now begin to ease. Still, with the sun linking to practical Saturn, your ruler, and explosive Pluto, reflecting on recent experiences can yield some valuable insights. If you have lost something or had to give up something, you might begin to appreciate why this happened. It may not make it much easier, but it could help you understand it. \r\n\r\nLovely Venus moves into your sector of communication on Monday, so this is the ideal time to talk things over. You might be surprised by how supportive others are and the advice they give you. And even if this has left you feeling a little vulnerable, you’ll soon be back on track with your sense of purpose renewed. \r\n\r\nGo easy with spending from Thursday, though, because inquisitive Mercury in your money zone could see you ready to splurge, especially if you spot a bargain on sale.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=10]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#9966ff]Aquarius ♒[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"You may appear calm and collected on the outside, but feelings could be bubbling away on the inside. Last week’s intense focus may have seen you questioning events in your life and the reasons for them. \r\n\r\nThis week, with the sun merging with careful Saturn and power-broker Pluto, you may gain an even greater understanding of why they occurred. It could be that they shaped your character and nature in certain ways, and your destiny, too. \r\n\r\nDon’t feel bad about treating yourself, because you deserve it. Lovely Venus moves into your money zone on Monday, so it’s time to invest in you, especially if recent events have left you drained. Get a massage, enjoy a spa day, or get away for a short break, because any one of these could do you a world of good. \r\n\r\nArticulate Mercury’s move into your sign on Thursday is perfect for talking things over and getting advice. Restless energies over the weekend could see you eager for some excitement.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=11]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#cccc66]Pisces ♓[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"What are friends for? This is something you might have considered in depth last week when a powerful blend of energies may have brought change to your social life. If you decided to distance yourself from certain toxic relationships, that was a wise move. This week, you may begin to feel the benefits of your actions and realize that this is something you should have done long ago. \r\n\r\nStill, as delectable Venus enters your sign on Monday, it can encourage a more compassionate stance. Don’t think of calling these people up and inviting them back, though, because chances are, you’d find yourself back at square one. Create firm boundaries and keep them in place. \r\n\r\nArticulate Mercury enters your spiritual sector on Thursday, and you might connect with other friends who share your ideas and beliefs. It’s likely that they’ll be very much on your wavelength, so this could be very uplifting.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=12]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Alan Watts on Polarity[/color][/b]\r\n[video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icjmx5EOkkU[/video]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2331053][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/comics-mix.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=center]\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 1 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/funny-and-wholesome-comics-salih-gonenli-coverimage.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 2 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://www.demilked.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5e1835a0660d6-20-comics-illustrating-the-daily-moments-from-our-relationship-5e1444098dd1c__880.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 3 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://i.pinimg.com/236x/84/6a/9b/846a9b338872de1857edf16383d8f98f.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 4 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENiDukLUUAAiTaq.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 5 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://preview.redd.it/f3va328grx941.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=194622390eb5f5a1faed25f48412b25a2e061787[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 6 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENNsyXJUYAEhJfe.jpg[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 7 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://safr.kingfeatures.com/api/img.php?e=gif&s=c&file=QmV0d2VlbkZyaWVuZHMvMjAyMC8wMS9CZXR3ZWVuX0ZyaWVuZHMuMjAyMDAxMTBfMTUzNi5naWY=[/img][/sp]\r\n\r\n[b][size=x-large]- 8 -[/size][/b][sp=][img]https://d1ejxu6vysztl5.cloudfront.net/comics/garfield/2020/2020-01-10.gif?v=1.1[/img][/sp]\r\n[/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://twitter.com/HFWrit3rs][img]https://www.hackforums.news/assets/v4/twitter.png[/img][/url]\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/HFWrit3rs][b]Follow us on Twitter and get hot Hack Forums news straight to your phone in a timely manner![/b][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color][/size][/font]",
