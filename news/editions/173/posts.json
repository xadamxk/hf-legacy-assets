To read any older editions of HF News, please go [url=http://goo.gl/pxojJ]here[/url]. \n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbhPs9hmpFm4Tm.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Upgrade System Offline[/b][/color]\nEarlier this week [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] posted a thread in the Rules, Announcements, News, and Feedback section stating that the payment processor for Hack Forums was offline. This meant that PayPal donations, rank purchases, and sticky purchases could not be completed. He did state, however, that the payment processor has nothing to do with BitCoin purchases, and that the option of buying L33t membership with BTC is still possible. Furthermore, he stated he would add adjustments in order to add the option towards Ub3r purchases as well. Later on the thread, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] made it clear that a power outage was the reason behind the problem, which included their backup power as well. Before locking the thread, it was made clear that all services were once again operating as usual. You can view the thread [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3925527]here[/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Return of the Old: Ranks[/b][/color]\nMany newer members will be accustomed to the member ranks based on post count that change when a certain number of posts has been reached. For a long time, longer than most active members have been on Hack Forums, these ranks included names such as \"Alpha\", \"Beta\", \"Gamma\", \"Delta\", etc. However, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] has decided to change those ranks back to what they were previously. Using names from the Dune novels by Frank Herbert, these ranks include the names \"Powindah\", \"Harkonnen\", \"Mentat\", \"Sardukar\", \"Fremen\", \"Tleilaxu\", Atreides\", and \"Kwisatz Haderach\". An excellent explanation of each of these names, along with the required post count, can be found in [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3925680][b]this thread[/b][/url] made by the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=44755][b]'Snorlax[/b][/url].\n\n[color=white][b]Hitmen and Threats[/b][/color]\nOn the 14th of December, [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1][b]Omniscient[/b][/url] posted a [url=https://twitter.com/HackForumsNet/statuses/411728613554135040]Twitter status[/url] stating that, \"[i]Ths (sic) IP just offered a hitman service on HF and then threatened my life.  Enjoy. 72.220.33.249[/i]\". The severity of a threat like this is something that most members will never have to deal with, however, this should also serve as a reminder of the types of people someone could come in contact with any day while spending time on the Internet. Although most of these types of threats are made by people who have no actual intention of following through with their text-based or verbal statements, one should not forget that there are people out there who are very serious, and very dangerous. Always stay safe online, and if you feel uncomfortable with someone, simply cease communications with that individual. The IP posted in the Twitter status seems to originate from the state of California.\n\n[color=white][b]Contest of Contests: $1000[/b][/color]\nEvery day, many contests reside in the Member Contests section. Although a large portion of said contests are relatively low rewarding, some stand out from the others. Earlier this month, the member [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=677529][b]Anonymous[/b][/url] posted a [url=http://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3920345]thread[/url] in the contests area promising a massive $1000 giveaway, to be awarded to ten lucky people in sections of $100 each. As the sheer amount of threads posted weekly, querying other members on how to earn a small amount of money online, clearly state, this is an excellent opportunity for those wanting to earn some extra spending money. The contest started on December 10th and will end on January 13th.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jKJXzuDW3M4XE.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]User News[/b][/color]\n[list]\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=166074][color=#00AAFF][b]Calibur[/b][/color][/url] hit 1,000 reputation.\n[*] [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=651773][color=#EFEFEF][b]Vitani's Mate[/b][/color][/url] hit 70,000 posts.

Today we're interviewing HF's most loved member, eiqhtworks. Any shoutouts?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Saturday, Chaos, Saturn, Orgasmic, Yellows, Levi, and SkullTraill. Please don't QQ if I forgot you.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Tell us, how did you stumble upon Hackforums.net? What was your intent for signing up?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] My intent was having big hacks. I wanted to ddos, RAT, and be a big hecker. People were hurting my feelings on XBL and I wanted to fry their routers to oblivion.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Nobody mapped oblivion. Did you ever give up the hacking scene to go grow roses in the disarray or is that still your thing?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Yeah, after I found out Jay's Booter can't fry I quit. Now I'm a hq Writ3r and do hq stuff.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I see. So what do you do for the HF news, exactly, for those who don't know.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] I write the music news, a section 99% of HF does not read. I put my soul into the music news, it is my life. If I wasn't in the Writ3rs I would probably be doing crystal herion with my boy Tyrese. Writ3rs changed my life and I would like to thank Viral.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Are you a regular drug user, by any chance?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Yes, PCP and weed is my preferred choice. I like getting high while listening to the angelic voice of Lights, a goddess.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] It seems we have a few things in common. So you're one of HF's biggest trolls. Do you agree with this label?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] No, I'm not even a troll and who ever thinks that can fuck off. Also fuck all you wannabe Lights fans.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You're not a troll, eh? So explain being repfucked 17 times.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Uh, didn't neccesarily have to do with being a troll. Mostly people QQing about rep abuse, I still have some of the PMs JD sent me to quit it.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] But you didn't \"quit it\" by the looks of it. A quick skim through your posts proves otherwise.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Is this bully eiqhtwurks hour?\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Yes. You've requested off air that I ask you how you are so gorgeous. Do tell. \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Well you see, Sat, it's all about the shampoo. You can't use Suave, you gotta use Herbal Essence. Really brings out the shine in your hair. Also conditioner is a must, I recommend Pantene. If you need any more advice, please PM me.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I spotted my critical errors instantly. Moving on to more HF related things, what has been your biggest accomplishment on this wonderful website?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Omni tweeting about repfucking me two years ago was probably my biggest. I'm still awardless, so I haven't really accomplished much.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] I was thinking about positive accomplishments. What positive things have you done for the site, other than bless us with your company.\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Positive accomplishments besides blessing and touching the lives of many on HF on a daily basis? I wrote a RAT tut once when I was trying to impress Omni back when I was a degenerate, peasant L33t.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] You were into ratting? Do you, by any chance, have me ratted?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] No, pls Sat that is against HF rules. I'm not falling for your trap.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] So being the music writer for the news, who are some of your favorite artists?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Obviously Lights. Others include Dizzy Wright, Dr Dre, Nipsey Hussle, A$AP Rocky(fuck Ferg), Hopsin, Nas, Tupac, Em, Danny Brown, Ofwg, Joey Bada$$, Lorde, and of course my lord, the very rare Lil B (peace be upon him)\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=787112][color=#FF69B4][b]Saturday:[/b][/color][/url] Okay, this interview is getting boring. Anything to say before I go?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=752389][color=white][b]eiqhtworks:[/b][/color][/url] Fuck off m8.[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color]  Heyo. Welcome to this weeks edition of the HF news. Today we're interviewing Teh Afro. What's going on? Any shoutouts before we begin?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] Thanks for having me Clique, nothing much Clique, just been working on some projects and playing some CSS. I'd like to give a shoutout to GnomeChompski, PatSharp, Brian Peppers, Skyguy, Chloe Grace, Insidious, Keyser Soze, Shocking, UKF, Krew, iNuke, Eternal, Anonymous, Wallet, there's so many. All of 143 and Illuminati.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Quite the list! Mind telling us about this project that you're working on?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] No, no, not really Clique. It's quite secretive. I'll tell you it involves another member named Wallet. He might have given it away in his interview but we have a lot of products coming out just after Christmas.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Looking forward to it! What's the thing that made you stay on the site when you registered?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] Not a lot actually. I joined back in the good old days of griefing, back when Nexus and PB were the two main clients, lurked around for a bit then went else where. I came back after a few friends joined up. Stayed on this forum almost exclusively ever since.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I also joined for Minecraft too, small world eh? Kinda phased out of MC towards the end of the beta. So, tell me about yourself. What does Teh Afro do in real life?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] I don't do a lot but what I do with my spare time usually consists of listening to music, playing games, maintaining my products or watching Netflix. What other spare time I have is spent either sleeping or at school.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] What about for winter break? I'm sure you have something special planned, eh?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] Not really, just spend time with the family. Watch some films, work on some more projects. Just generally relax. Oh and play that new Batman game, that looks pretty cool.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] I see that you're more of a PC gamer, eh? What do you want to become when you're out of school and all?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] I've recently applied to do a diploma in software development. I'd be happy to work as just about anything in the IT sector in all honesty though.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] That's pretty damn cool. So, I see that you're in quite a bit of groups. Which is your favorite? Do you like where groups are going as it is?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] I am and I try to be active in all of them. I'm a group and award whore, what can I say. My favorite would be 143 or Illuminati. Yes I do, but they could be improved. I'd like to lead a group too, so if a group leader is reading this, hit me up yeah? \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] True, true. Do you visit other forums? Or is this your main site?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] This is my main site. I don't really visit any other anymore.\n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Glad to see that you've stuck around. What do you think of the weekly news? Anything that we should change?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] Nope, I love how it is at the moment. I read every edition. \n\n[b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1148878][color=#FFA500]Clique:[/url][/b][/color] Good to hear! We've come to the end of this weeks interview. You have anything you'd like to say before we're finished?\n[color=white][b][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828]Teh Afro[/url]:[/b][/color] Nope, just thanks a lot for having me and keep up with the good work. \n[/spoiler]\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]Interview[/font][/size][/color] [color=white][size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva]-[/font][/size][/color] [size=large][font=Monotype Corsiva][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131]Wallet[/url][/font][/size]\n[spoiler=][url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Welcome to the 173rd edition of the HF News. Today we're here with The Empire member, Wallet. How goes it? Do you have any shoutouts you'd like to make before we begin?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] Thank you for taking the time to interview me, Clark. As for the shoutout part; \"no one named, no one forgotten\".\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] My pleasure. So how exactly did you find Hack Forums?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] Well, I found Hack Forums after realizing I've been hacked after logging into Runescape. All my gold was gone, again. I wanted to learn how to do these things; I went on YouTube searching for \"RATs and Keyloggers\", and to my luck I just installed a backdoor or an infected version. Then one beautiful day I found HackForums.net when searching \"Hack\" on Google. I did not hesitate to fill out the sign up form! Baum! I was in the most amazing online community to date. I do not regret a second of it, yet... haha.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] You won't regret it. So since your registration, have you learned anymore about hacking or computers in general?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] I've learned very much! I did some research on my own but honestly 90% of the information I've gained since September has been from quality members and their well-composed tutorials and compilations. I learned how to RAT and how to keylog, that good stuff. But there is way more! I learned how to make money, and how to market products. Teh Afro and I are planning on releasing a brand new product for all of HF to enjoy. It will be good, I promise. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] That's all very wonderful to hear! Would you care to tell us a little more about your upcoming release with the user [url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=860828][b]Teh Afro[/b][/url]?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] I don't want to sound like a noob but here I go again... It's classified Intel! But I can reveal that it will compete with products who are well-known already, so you better watch out for some real competition! No, just kidding, we'll see how it goes. We started with this product a couple of days ago and is scheduled to be completed in about 2 1/2 weeks. Time will tell!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] We'll be on the lookout. So do you have any other plans for your future here on HF? Perhaps any goals or ideas?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] I am trying to encourage all members to show appreciation to each other and be happy with what they've got. My future plans for the rest of my stay here on HF... IDK, It's hard to answer really! Just being a happy member and spreading the love is good enough for me. I will confront anything that may be thrown at me along my journey. I simply take it as times come along.\nThe last month has changed my Hack Forums experience drastically since I've been added into two respected usergroups with amazing members and leaders. This was a door-opener for me and I became so much more motivated and social on this forum. A whole new world opens to you when you've been added into a group, you can't imagine. I plan on making more money and contribute more and more the community. It's been an amazing run so far at least!\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] So I take it that English isn't your first language? What is? Do you mind telling us a little more about yourself?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] Oh no, you found out. English is my secondary language as Norwegian is my primary one. I am a 15 year old newbie who residents on the west-coast of Norway in a city called Ålesund, beautiful place. My name is originally Johan Nicolai... my friends shorts it down to Nico and my parents to Nicolai; my teachers call me Johan Nicolai. It is a pain sometimes because it gets awkward due to the reason those teachers has known me for like three years they still can't remember! I go to the gym regularly, I work out till I break a sweat and I return to my fortress and eat tacos. I am working hard to enhance my English, especially on the grammatical side. But I've heard members say that I have pretty good English considering I'm foreign. I live in a loving and caring family of four members, sometimes too much love and care... Oh well! You're probably bored after reading this wall of text of me now ha-ha. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] Not at all. It's always interesting to learn more about other peoples history. I would also say you have a great vocabulary for a foreigner. So you workout lots eh? That's good. Are tacos really a good thing to eat after a workout? lol\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] I mean that tacos are a healthy supplement before and after a training session. It just helps you build heaps of muscles and maintain stamina. I actually go to a center called Stamina HOT, they teach me how to build muscle mass and stay toned. In all seriousness, thanks for the compliment, it warms my heart, it really does! I started working out for about 5 weeks ago, me and a bunch of friends. I am determined to get stronger than them so I just keep pushing for that. \n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] It's always good to workout with friends. It's very motivational. I know you haven't been here too long but if you had to change one thing about HF, what would it be and why?\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] To have regular members respected more. Regular Members are less recognized around the forum which I totally am aware off. However, they are still apart of a big and usual caring community. And judging from experience those less recognized members are actually way more grateful and thankful when someone really takes time to give a good reply to that question they asked. Is it because those upgraded members are afraid of not being able to receive their well deserved reputation point from that post? I am wondering. Because in many cases regular members expresses way more gratitude than upgraded ones. That is just my opinion on the case. So guys, help those less recognized members and build on their knowledge so in perhaps a few months they can help the new generation.\n\n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1653635][b][color=#FFD700]Clark:[/color][/b][/url] It's very kind of you to lookout for those who have yet to upgrade. On that note, I think we should rap this up. Any final thoughts you'd like to share with us? \n[url=http://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1960131][b][color=white]Wallet:[/color][/b][/url] I would like to yet again say thank you for taking such time to interview me. Who doesn't love a little extra attention? ^^. A special thank you to those who has supported me, it means so much to me, you can't imagine. I love reading the HF News so it's great fun to be apart of it.\nAll of HF shall thereby have a happy Holiday and get many gifts from Santa. [/spoiler]",

      "message": "[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jzLFNNsreKGGO.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Destiny Information[/b][/color]\nBungie recently talked about Destiny, and it's competitive multiplayer and voice chat. They've stated that voice chat in the game will be limited to fireteams so that players will not be able to have their nights ruined. \"Definitely faster. If we are to talk about lethality, it's certainly more lethal than Halo,\" Bakken said. \"When you catch a guy with his pants down, you can take him out really quickly. And that's not even including using a heavy weapon or a super to do that. But generally, your primary assault class weapons are going to do a little more damage than what he had in Halo.\" \"One of the things that we're doing for the first time ever in Destiny, we're taking a different approach to voice chat. We know that, not just in multiplayer, that in general, when you get into a game with someone that you don't know or someone that you've never seen before and may never see again, they have this power to completely destroy your entire experience and maybe ruin the game for you forever. And so what we're doing instead of having that...one in ten chance possibility of someone ruining your game, we're effectively saying you only have voice chat to your fireteam. And we're doing other things to let you communicate with other players, but it'll be interesting to see how people react to it, for sure.\" Bungie also stated there are unannounced systems that anchor players to play the campaign mode. However, these systems won't be talked about for quite a while. Destiny launches for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 on September 9, 2014. A Destiny beta will be available earlier in the year for all consoles.\n\n[color=white][b]Xbox One and PS4 Firmware Updates[/b][/color]\nThe Xbox One and PS4 have received their first firmware updates which address a number of issues. Microsoft announced that the newest update aims to fix various issues including smart glass connectivity, multiplayer issues, dashboard performance, notification issues and more. Microsoft also stated there are many updates planned for 2014 which are based on community feedback. Sony's update promises to improve system software stability. However, that is all Sony announced in regards to this update. Recently, both parties announced console sales, with Sony in the lead with 2.1 million consoles in the wild, and Microsoft being not far behind with 2 million consoles sold. Notably, Sony has launched their console in more regions.\n\n[color=white][b]Minecraft Sales[/b][/color]\nIt keeps on getting bigger and bigger. Mojang have revealed two more milestones for the popular block-survival title. The PC/Mac version of the game has reached 13 million copies sold since launch. The game achieved 12 million sales in September, only 3 months ago. The Xbox 360 version has also been quite popular, reaching 10 million copies sold since the launch in May 2012. Since the 360 version passed the 10 million milestone, there are now three different versions that have surpassed 10 million copies sold (the third being the pocket edition). So, whats next for the game? Companies are already working on the Xbox One and PlayStation versions of the game.\n\n[color=white][b]Video of the Week[/b][/color]\nHow is your deck stacking up? TotalBiscuit shows the worst deck known to man.\n\n[align=center][yt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI-QfA8qZn8[/yt][/align]\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jvReziQN6QtFr.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Interesting Additions to 1.7.4[/color][/b]\nQuite obviously, the integration of Twitch.tv streaming into Minecraft has been the notorious feature of 1.7.4. However, there are a few nifty additions that might further hype its release. Right clicking a sheep with a nametag named \"jeb_\" (one of Mojang's lead developers) will cause the sheep to continuously change colors every few seconds in a rainbow-type effect. Secondly, the addition of chicken jockeys has been released. In the past, the only mob-riding-mob spawn that was around was the spider jockey (a skeleton riding a spider), however that's changed in 1.7.4. If you're lucky enough to find a baby zombie riding a chicken, then you'll have witnessed this addition-- it's only a 0.25% spawn rate though.\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft PE 0.8[/color][/b]\nAfter the announcement of their acceptance of beta testers, Mojang has finally done enough testing to release a new version of their pocket edition game. Some of the notable new features include, but aren't limited to: minecarts (with railing systems), animal breeding, smarter AI, new crops, and new blocks. It's even being said that PC-exclusive textures have been implemented, giving the game a better feel to it. Lastly-- and as expected-- there have been tons of bug fixes with this release.\n\n[b][color=white]Minecraft 360: Half-priced DLC![/color][/b]\nIn celebration of selling ten million copies of their game, developers at Mojang and 4J studios have decided to sell all of their DLC for half of the price for the holiday season starting on December 14th after the announcement from [url=www.twitter.com/Kappische]Kappische[/url]. They didn't quite state what the deal pertained to in terms of what you can get, however, the only thing that they had mentioned that didn't apply was mashups. That being said, happy shopping Minecraft 360'ers!\n\n[b][color=#43a828]Hacker[/color][color=#9428a8]Craft[/color] [color=white]News[/color][/b]\nThe server's news has still been further postponed due to a lack of activity. Omniscient has stated that he has plans for the near future, though, so don't be discouraged as the HackerCraft news will definitely see another day.\n\n[b][color=#ffcc33]Featured Server of the Week:[/color] [color=white]Hypixel[/color][/b]\nAfter the 1.7 update, Hypixel decided to allow its servers to be compatible for both 1.6.4 and 1.7.x, permitting players of all kinds to play with them. That being said, if you're into mini-games with lobbies always filled with people, you should definitely check them out. They even have a completely custom survival games server titled \"Blitz Survival Games,\" which is definitely recommended. Connect today at mc.hypixel.net!\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbk3er9WdlWUGL.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]China Lands Robot On Moon[/b][/color]\nChina's space program reached a huge milestone as their rover, Jade Rabbit, safely landed on the moon this past Saturday. The project will operate over the next year gathering measurements of the lunar crust.\n\n[color=white][b]North Korean Leader's Uncle Executed for Treason[/b][/color]\nJan Song-Taek, uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, was executed immediately after a military court found him guilty of attempting to overthrow the government. Song-Taek was considered the second most powerful man in the country and this turn of events has startled many people. As expected, the North Korean government has not released information on the details of the case.\n\n[color=white][b]Snowden Evidence to be Given to European Union Parliament[/b][/color]\nThe European Parliament's committee on civil liberties, justice, and home affairs is planning on having Edward Snowden testify about the documents he leaked earlier this year via video conferencing later this month. “Edward Snowden's revelations merit serious debate on whether the intelligence services are out of control... it is essential that he is asked the right questions,” stated Sarah Ludford, a Liberal Democrat member of the parliament.\n\n[color=white][b]German President Boycotts Russian Olympics[/b][/color]\nJoachim Gauck, the German president announced that he would not attend the Russian Winter Olympics in February likely in response to alleged human rights violations. It is yet unknown if other politicians will follow in his footsteps; however many, including German chancellor Angela Merkel, have taken the stance that their presence at the games would make a better statement than boycotting. Russia has received considerable criticism from the western governments over the last few months due to their recently passed anti-homosexuality laws and for granting Edward Snowden temporary asylum instead of extraditing him to the United States.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbpto8022b2C4P.png[/img][/align]\n\n[color=white][b]Recon's Sports Gear Stream Stats To Facebook[/b][/color]\nRecon Instruments is working on gear that will soon stream statistics about extreme activities to Facebook. This gear will stream stats such as speed, vertical descent and distance covered right to your Facebook profile. This is the primary feature of their ReconOS 3.2 update, which will be released soon. The update is expected to drop on December 18th.\n\n[color=white][b]Amazon To Launch Online Wholesale Store[/b][/color]\nAmazon is supposedly gearing up to launch a new service know as Pantry. Pantry is said to be a wholesale store such as Costco, where a user can fill up a box with items and have it shipped to their home for a fee. The service will supposedly start out carrying around 2,000 common grocery items that will be sold at low costs. There has been no word from Amazon yet, but sources say that the service will launch in 2014.\n\n[color=white][b]Amazon Launches Digital PlayStation Store In UK[/b][/color]\nFollowing its launch in the US, Amazon launched their PlayStation Network store in the UK. This store lets you buy your PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita games online through their website. While Amazon didn't offer any promotions for the UK version much like they did in the US, it has been received positive reviews. This could mean more places online could offer PlayStation games in the future.\n\n[color=white][b]SteamOS Available Now[/b][/color]\nAs Valve stated, it has made its first version of SteamOS available for public, free download. This OS is based off the Debian 7.1 flavor of Linux. It is meant for playing PC games on the TV, supposedly working better than any other operating system. Valve has stated that this build of the OS is only recommended for this who have experience with Linux. They said that people with little to no experience will be able to get a more polished version of the OS next year, when the Steam Machines will be officially available.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jR3lvB4HTGn9G.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Beyonce Surprises World With New Album[/color][/b]\nNobody knew when Bey was going to release this album, most didn't even know she was even working on an album. Well, late Thursday night, right around midnight EST, Beyonce, without all that much pomp and circumstance and absolutely no prior warning, dropped [i]Beyonce[/i], a 14-track \"visual album\" with features from Frank Ocean, husband Jay Z, and even her daughter Blue Ivy. Francesco Carrozzini, B's video director, didn't even know when it was going to be released. The album is available on iTunes, but individual tracks won't be available until December 20. A beautiful surprise it was, the album is already getting the thumbs up from music critics. \n\n[b][color=white]Hopsin Shouts Out Macklemore For 'Embracing' White-Guy Status[/color][/b]\nOne of the realest and best rappers in the game shouted out Macklemore recently in an interview with MTV. On his latest album, Knock Madness, Hopsin kept the features to a minimum, rapping alongside labelmate Dizzy Wright and TechN9ne, with very few additional appearances, but there was one MC he would've liked to work with under the right circumstances: Macklemore. Hopsin explained that he's a huge fan of the Seattle rapper because he's so low on pretenses, but the timing just wasn't on his side. \"I wanted to work with Macklemore but by the time I had something ready it was too late,\" Hopsin told MTV News. \"The day I [wanted to reach out to him], he was on an MTV award show, walking up to accept the award as I'm sitting there texting him. It was horrible timing, he's way too busy.\" He also mentioned that M&RL are \"dope\" and that Yeezys was \"whack\" (which we all know).\n\n[b][color=white]\"Royals\" Crowned Song Of The Year.[/color][/b]\nWho in their right mind would disagree? The anti-materialistic, anti-mainstream song caught on like wild fire, but sadly many don't even care about the meaning. Lorde, only 16 years of age, defeated the likes of Kanye, Lady Gage, Katy Perry and more. In November of 2012, 16-year-old Ella Yelich-O'Connor released her debut EP, Love Club, into the world, after signing to Universal Music at age 13 (that's right, only 13). She did so much promotion and fanfare and, what's more, she did so for free via SoundCloud; she followed in the footsteps of R&B and hip-hop idols like The Weeknd, who released his debut mixtape, House of Balloons, in a similar fashion back in 2011. That \"idiosyncratic song,\" however, completely ruled once it hit the U.S. full-force during the summer of 2013, landing on Spotify's \"Most Viral\" chart (Lorde was also the most viral artist of the year), and scoring scads of interviews — all before her debut LP Pure Heroine dropped in September. And long before she had even visited the States— for the first time ever. Inspirational, about time we had an artist that's different from the rest.\n\n[align=center][img]http://i.minus.com/jbqvv2o0WFZf18.png[/img][/align]\n\nThis is basically my own little corner to type up my thoughts and some standpoints on different topics.\n---\nResolve. Procrastination and laziness can be powerful poisons to your success. If you simply deny procrastination and laziness access to your faculties, life will become more productive. This is resolve. You must firmly decide in a direction and follow it. If something needs to be done, have the resolve to work on and complete it in a timely fashion. Work hard. Do not let boundaries or obstructions to block your way. Never give in, never give up. Be resolute.",
