You will soon notice that the order of our sections have moved around, that is the first front-end change you will notice. In addition to that, we have introduced our new section, Health Science: a section that will talk about health and fitness and what we can do to improve our health over time - it will be a great way for us to learn more about our body. For Battlestations section, we will now be posting two battlestations instead of one. This will give more variety and it is quite possible we will increase it to a total of three. Although the front-end changed a bit, the majority of the changes impact the back-end because we had an unstable base. In many cases, if one member did not do their work, we did not have anyone to cover. With this new system, we introduced a new on-call team where they will step in and cover the missing sections. Quality in our writing has improved as well. We now require our scholars to proofread each and every section instead of one per compilation(post 1, 2, 3, 4). They have been catching a lot more grammatical errors and it has been one of the best changes we have made in my opinion. Lastly, we have put in place a new set of writing guidelines, AP style. AP style is well known in journalism and is the type of writing and rules one follows. Rules such as writing 3 as three and November 6th as Nov. 6. This will also enhance our writing quality and we will continue to improve as time goes by. That is all for now, thank you for reading the HF News! We'd love to hear feedback from you all.\n\n[size=x-small][color=#777777]*Memo will return to its normal position next week.[/color][/size]\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\n\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Headlines.png[/img]\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Odus.png[/img][/align]\n\n[b][color=white]Further Tweaks[/color][/b]\nFollowing the server move, Hack Forums’ database has migrated from MySQL to MariaDB for its management system.

Before we begin, do you have any shoutouts you would like to make?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Hello! Thanks a lot. I would like to make a big shoutout to Durham, Flacko Jodye and also Vitani's Mate on Hack Forums, amazing members and amazing friends!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] So you're interested in gaming? What games do you play?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I am interested in gaming. I'm not really a hardcore gamer however I enjoy playing some games. I mostly play Counter Strike 1.6, Left 4 Dead 2 and GTA IV.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] What inspired you to join Hack Forums?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Well, firstly I joined Hackforums back in 2013 because someone hacked three of my big Facebook pages and I was seeking for revenge as I knew who it was. But after a while I forgot about it and was interested to learn more about hacking instead, such as RAT's etc. However I lost my interest in RATting and started to lurking around instead and made some new friends. I really enjoyed being a part of such a nice community and I was no longer there because of hacking.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] What made you stay at Hack Forums, for all these years?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] The main reason I stay in this community was because I made lots of new friends and I found lots of interesting things. I don't really know but I enjoyed to be a part of the community. I feel respected on this forum by members and I love it.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] I see you have high post activities in some marketplace sections, do you do any kind of sales on Hack Forums? What kind?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] That's something I've never thought about to be honest. I don't really have an answer on why my activity in the Marketplace sections is so high as I don't have any big kinds of business related projects on Hack Forums. The only thing I sell on Hackforums is Twitter Followers, that may be why my activity is so high.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Many members would know you as a lounger. Do you see your self this way? If you could change your posting habits, what would you change them to?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] That is correct and I see myself as a lounger as well. I love lurking around in The Lounge for interesting threads and such. As a EDM Producer I would probably be way more active in the \"Melody, Harmony, Rhythm, and MP3\" section in that case. I know a lot about Music myself and feel like that's where I would belong if I would change my posting habits a bit more.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] You make music? Awesome! Do you pursue it as a career or a hobby?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do. I've been producing music for around seven years now and it's something I love to do! I'll never stop producing music. As of now it's my absolute #1 passion, but right now it's more of like a hobby as I don't really have a career yet. I'm selling my music though and make money that way and that's something really special for me as I get to make Money while doing what I love, that's a huge achievement for me!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Apart from your own music, do you listen to any other music? Do you have any favourite artists or tracks?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I listen to a lots of different genres. My absolute favorite band is Iron Maiden, that's a band I grew up with and that's a band I listen to daily. I even have a tattoo of their mascot called \"Eddie\" tattooed on my scapular. I love all kinds of music to be honest but mostly listen to music under the genre: House, Dubstep, Melbourne Bounce, Hardstyle & Heavy Metal. My overall favorite track is from Iron Maiden though and it's called Blood Brothers. That's a track that have meant a lot of me in life.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] So I see you're in a LOT of groups! Which one would you say best fits you?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I'm in a few groups and as I'm a so called Lounger I'd say the group Axiom is the one that fits me the best and that's where I spend most of my time in. I love the other groups as well and being in Red Lions is also a huge achievement for me as I have been one of those members that looks up to them a LOT, and now I'm apart of it. So it's such a great feeling and a big achievement for me.\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] When gaming, do you prefer to game with friends or on your own? If with friends, Hack Forums?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] I pretty much never game with my Hack Forums friends to be honest. But I sometimes invite one or two friends over to my house to have like a \"Lan\" party. I love that!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Do you have any hobbies outside Hack Forums?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Yes I do. When I'm not on Hack Forums I'm probably with my friends and practice my Muay Thai skills. That's something I love to do as well and have been doing it since I was a little kid. The only difference is when I was younger I had my dad training me instead!\n\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2250372][color=#9999FF][b]Optimized:[/b][/color][/url] Thank you Regulus, for your time. Before we finish, do you have anything you'd like to say or any shoutouts you'd like to make?\n[url=http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1680975][color=white][b]Regulus:[/b][/color][/url] Once again I'd like to make a shoutout to all my buddies in Axiom and a special shoutout to Durham, Flacko Jodye and also Vitani's Mate mate for being so awesome. Also a huge thanks and shoutout to Alone Vampire for letting me be a part of such a nice group!\n\n[/align][/spoiler][/align]\n\n[color=transparent]       [/color]",

The diet consisted of foods rich in carbohydrates and fats (hamburgers, pizza, cookies, etc.). The researchers were interested in learning how obesity triggers insulin resistance, which results in type two diabetes. During the study, the participants developed insulin resistance in just two to three days. Samples of urine were taken and the researchers discovered an increase in oxidative stress in the body. The stress caused alterations in a transport protein called GLUT4, which shuttles glucose into cells. GLUT4 changes may have resulted in insulin resistance. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/09/10/these-men-ate-6000-calories-day-for-science/]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]Fitness Tip of the Week: [i]Increasing Strength with Eccentrics[/i][/b][/color]\r\nThere are three phases to a muscular contraction:\r\n[list][*]Concentric (shortening or contracting of a muscle)\r\n[*]Eccentric (lengthening of a muscle)\r\n[*]Isometric (holding a contraction at a fixed joint angle)[/list]\r\nDid you know that the concentric portion yields the lowest amount of force/resistance, while an eccentric contraction produces the greatest amount of force and tension in the muscle? A prime example of an eccentric movement is the lowering phase of the barbell towards the chest during a bench press. A lot of people tend to think that the concentric aspect of an exercise is the most important part of the lift, but in order to receive a significant increase in strength, we should consider both. When it comes to eccentric lifts, speed and control are everything. During a barbell bench press, if you are lowering the bar to your chest at a fast, uncontrolled pace, you are minimizing the time under tension, evidently reducing the amount of strength that you could potentially be gaining and wasting valuable energy. Instead of lowering the bar fast, lower the bar down at a five to six second count; by the time you hit five or six seconds, the bar should be at your chest. Where there is a concentric contraction, there is always an eccentric contraction to counteract the force, so each exercise you do can be focused on eccentric movements as well. In order to achieve a true eccentric lift, you will need spotters to help assist. Going back to the lowering phase of the bench press, the amount of weight that you are lowering should yield a greater amount as compared to the lifting phase, since your muscles can withstand greater tension and resistance to a higher amount of weight. Once the bar is lowered all the way down, the spotters should lift the bar back up for you, since it should be more weight than you are capable of overcoming. You could do eccentrics without spotters, but if you want the full effect of a true eccentric lift, get some spotters and have them assist.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]       [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/SecurityNews.png[/img][/align]\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Hyperion.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]Another Day Another Infected Chinese App[/color][/b]\r\nWhile Apple has recently been dealing with infected apps from China, Android has seen their fair too. The difference is in control, with Apple apps only being on the store (unless jailbroken) and Android apps available anywhere. A security firm has discovered a library from Taomike SDK, that lets hackers steal your messages. The SDK was made to help advertisers push their apps and is used on over 63,000 apps, of these over 18,000 are thought to be malicious. The threats are currently in China only and from outside app stores, not the Google Play store, as none of these apps are available there. Only Android 4.4 and below are vulnerable because of how SMS is handled.

The Western Digital hard drives have the ability to encrypt your files, which is all well and good, except for the fact that there are glaring security issues. In the published research paper, six of the drives were vulnerable to attacks leading to the attacker(s) retrieving the encryption keys; one was even able to be brute forced. For now it still stands that the best encryption is to use reliable hardware and to pick your own encryption method.

The apps used a SDK developed by a Chinese firm, and were deleted due to them accessing personal information such as Apple IDs on client devices. Over one million users downloaded these apps and had their information potentially stolen, 95% being from China, where surprisingly the majority of infected apps have been coming from. In the past few months, several of these infected apps made it onto the US Apple App Store. With over 150 million apps on their store it does not come as a surprise that some are malicious.

The hackers behind the breach has let it be known they want to be paid in the untraceable currency, bitcoin. As TalkTalk do not store full credit card details, hackers with access to this data are attempting to get in touch with customers and retrieve the missing information; enabling them to withdraw money from a customer's bank account. Security journalist Brian Krebs, believes the hack was pulled off by a Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) technique. This was possible due to a poorly designed bit of data within the database. The journalist also believes this attack was masked by the denial-of-service attack, which took place earlier that day. The telecommunications company is now \"making security enhancements\". \r\n\r\n[url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/21/wikileaks-to-release-cia-director-john-brennan-emails][b][color=white]CIA Director's Email Leaked[/color][/b][/url]\r\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, John O. Brennan, has now been made a victim of cyber hacking by high school students, which call themselves \"Crackas With Attitude\". The group has gone to Twitter and have now announced the release of information within Brennan's email. The tweet reads as follows: \"ANNOUNCE: We have obtained the contents of CIA Chief John Brennan's email account and will be releasing it shortly.\" Authorities preach to the public that Brennan's email contained no classified information, however, documents regarding interrogation methods and other various intelligence has been found in the inbox of the director's email. This particular hack was done by the group retrieving and using the last four digits of Brennan's credit card to reset his email password. The hackers are also now in possession of personal data, such as a person's social security number.\r\n\r\n[url=https://lifars.com/2015/10/cctc-cameras-used-by-hackers-to-create-malicious-botnets/][b][color=white]The All Seeing Eye Has Been Compromised[/color][/b][/url]\r\nCCTV cameras has been used globally to launch denial-of-service attacks. As some CCTV cameras use their default passwords, this allows a hacker with the wrong intentions to take over the CCTV camera and use it as their own botnet. This is done by targeting a specific website or person with an IP address, and sending a mass of traffic to the target. This will render the target inaccessible. The cameras are able to be accessed globally simultaneously, as long as the existing password is the default password. An attack of which 900 CCTV cameras were used per second, has been recorded and released by the security company Incapsula.\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]    [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/WorldNews.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Phreakdaline.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=left][color=#FFFFFF][b]Authorities Shut Down Drug Tunnel on U.S./Mexico Border[/b][/color]\r\nA massive drug smuggling tunnel was discovered by federal agents this week, complete with ventilation, lighting, and a fully functioning railway. The tunnel provided a direct route from a warehouse in Tijuana, to a similar warehouse in San Diego over half of a mile away. Authorities believe that the tunnel was being run by the notorious Joaquin Guzman, better known as \"El Chapo\". Approximately 12 tons of Marijuana was seized in the raid, and 22 people were arrested for involvement in the smuggling operation. The tunnel was discovered as a part of a six months long investigation by an undercover federal agent, who transported buckets of dirt from the San Diego warehouse during the presumed construction of the tunnel. After offering to help move drugs as well, the agent was told about a large Marijuana shipment that would take place on Wednesday, October 21, prompting the drug seizure and arrests. U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy of Southern California was quoted saying \"We see a super tunnel open for business once every year or so. Just when traffickers think they're ready to move, we put them out of business.\" [i][size=x-small][url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/us/drug-super-tunnel-tijuana-san-diego/index.html]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFFFF][b]Two Killed During Attack at Swedish School[/b][/color]\r\nTragedy struck in a rare occurrence for Swedish schools, when a masked man attacked students and teachers on campus Thursday. The suspect reportedly arrived on campus wearing a black trench coat, mask, and helmet. Armed with a sword and several knives, the attacker injured several students, killing one student, and one teacher. A witness who is being called Sarah, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that after taking a picture of the suspect, not realizing the danger they were in, a teacher approached the man and asked him to leave. Sarah said the man just nodded then stabbed the teacher in the side with his knife. Police responded to a call at around 10:10 a.m. local time (08:10 GMT), and shot the suspect on campus. He died of his injuries. Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it was a \"black day for Sweden\". This type of horrific event is rare for the country, and is only the second fatal school attack on record in the last 20 years.

The storm formed on Tuesday October 20 as a tropical storm, growing into a hurricane in just one day. Categorized as level five, the hurricane has had winds nearing 200 miles per hour. The power of Patricia is comparable to Typhoon Haiyan, the storm that killed over 7,300 in the Philippines in 2013. Mexican officials have declared a state of emergency, and many coastal towns have been evacuated. On Friday October 24, the storm was downgraded to a category four, but weather specialists warn that it is still an incredibly dangerous storm.

The news came from the user on October 15 on the social media platform Twitter. The content of that tweet was as follows: [url=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1snlj3r]“Well, I don’t know if there is really a right way to tell people this, so I guess here goes. The CT did not come back negative. The cancer in the bowel is gone, but spots have appeared in my liver. They’re not operable and there’s no cure. Average life expectancy is 2-3 years, though there are outliers that live much longer.”[/url] TotalBiscuit bypassed the 140 character tweet limit with the Twitter extension TwitLonger.

There is a possibility that NX, whatever it may be, will be announced as early as 2016. NX, Nintendo’s next gaming platform project, has yet to be confirmed to be either a mobile or console gaming system, but it’s predicted that it will be similar to the Wii U in that it may combine the two system types. The NX is said to contain “industry leading chips,” which would most likely be in response to criticism of the Wii U being underpowered in comparison with other current generation gaming systems. This information is coming from industry insiders who claim to be familiar with the development plans for the NX. Official information regarding the NX isn’t expected to surface until 2016. \r\n\r\n[url=http://gamingbolt.com/silent-hills-cancellation-makes-no-sense-guillermo-del-toro][b][color=white]Guillermo del Toro Speaks on Cancellation of Silent Hills[/color][/b][/url]\r\nIt was one year ago that P.T. was made available to players as a sort of playable video game trailer for a future Silent Hill title, dubbed Silent Hills. P.T. quickly came under widespread praise from horror gamers and built excitement for a new full Silent Hill game. However, the game was suddenly cancelled after a falling out between Hideo Kojima and Konami. The famed actor Guillermo del Toro was also involved with the project and had very high hopes for it, which explains why he is maintaining such confusion at the randomness of this decision by Konami. In an interview with [url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3364524/interview-guillermo-del-toro-on-serenading-crews-silent-hills-and-crimson-peak/]Bloody Disgusting[/url] he relayed the following message: “The thing with Kojima and Silent Hills is that I thought we would do a really remarkable game and really go for the jugular. We were hoping to actually create some sort of panic with some of the devices we were talking about and it is really a shame that it’s not happening. When you ask about how things operate, that makes no sense at all that that game is not happening.”\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]         [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/TechNews.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://hackforums.news/assets/v1/Gladly.png[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[align=left][color=#FFFFFF][b]LG to Release Dual Screen Phone[/b][/color]\r\nAs phones with odd screen properties become more prevalent recently in phones like the Galaxy S6 Edge, LG has decided to release one of their own. Dubbed the LG V10 as of now, the smartphone will feature a 5.9 inch screen which will be quad-HD resolution, as well as a minuscule, 1024 pixel by 160 pixel display. The display will be used much like the Galaxy S6’s sidebar, hosting quick launch icons that work in conjunction with the phone’s main screen. The second display sits to the right of its two front cameras. You read that correctly - two front facing cameras. The second front camera helps with wide angle selfies, capturing a larger field of view so everyone fits in the picture. Many of the V10’s specifications match those of LG’s flagship G4, including the battery, processor, volume and power buttons, and rear facing camera. The smartphone will debut in the US in November.

But what may come next, may out do SSDs by a mile. The photonic memory works by moving and matching light waves across the alloy coating on the storage device. According to Oxford researchers, this process works similarly to rewritable CDs and Blu-Ray discs. Researchers also say that there is still time before the drives will be commercialized, as their size is much larger than a solid state drive or hard disk drive.

Designer Hadeel Ayoub aims to turn this situation around not by teaching the masses sign language, but by presenting it to you in your own native tongue. The glove is fitted with sensors in every finger to detect movement, as well as accelerometers to show which position the user’s hands are in. The developer of the glove has even made a computer application that shows what exactly the glove’s user is saying. Ayoub plans to make a mobile application for the gloves to show translations, as well as support multiple languages of translation. The smart gloves will retail for slightly under $400 USD.
