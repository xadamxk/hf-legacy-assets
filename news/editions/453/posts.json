Android Police’s David Ruddock recently interviewed Kan Liu, a product leader for Chrome OS, saying, “the Chrome team is working – very possibly in cooperation with Valve – to bring Steam to Chromebooks.” This will extend Chromebooks to a new market and support Linux games, which falls right into the Chrome OS group. Chromebooks are predominantly web-based, and may not be able to handle many Steam games. But Liu said, “more powerful Chromebooks, especially AMD Chromebooks, are coming.” There’s no given timeline either for these more powerful Chromebooks. At this time, it will be a waiting game.

Authorities have said that facial recognition has helped identification of children and offenders on the run. Some of the big businesses that build this technology includes Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Recently, US politicians voiced their fears about progress and how truly reliable facial recognition is, with tech experts also joining in and voicing their concerns. The main point of concerns is that some facial recognition technologies are, “misidentify women and people of color.” This prompted US politicians to create a proposal for a bill to be put in place to slow down facial recognition.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51130904] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=white]NSA discovers major vulnerability - Windows 10[/color][/b]\r\nWindows 10, the world’s largest operating system in use, has recently been identified with a significant vulnerability. The NSA found the flaw and promptly told Microsoft of their results, and soon after a fix was put out. No known instances have been identified of hackers using the vulnerability. The NSA has decided not to use the vulnerability to spy on enemy networks, said Anne Neuberger, the director of the NSA’s Cybersecurity, “a recognition of what the mission needs at this point in time.” The vulnerability “was in the digital signatures used to determine if software is authentic, of the ways that software makers work to prevent malware or spyware cloaked as legitimate software.” Microsoft made a mistake of the way signatures were verified.[i][size=x-small][url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/14/microsoft-windows-10-patch-alert-nsa-major-flaw-needs-quick-fix/4466688002/] >>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[color=transparent]   [/color]\r\n\r\n[align=center][url=https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2890436][img]https://hackforums.news/assets/v4/vibes-pikachu.png[/img][/url][/align]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#ccffff]Horoscopes[/color][/b] / [i]Jan 20, 2020 - Jan 26, 2020[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b][color=#cc3333]Aries ♈[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"As the sun moves into Aquarius and your social zone on Monday for a four-week stay, it encourages you to enjoy mixing and mingling. Although there is still a powerful focus on your sector of career, and you may be still in the process of working through key issues, it’s time to give yourself a break. Besides, the people you connect with on the social scene could be extremely helpful in furthering your goals and ambitions. \r\n\r\nGo easy around midweek, especially if someone encourages you to buy a membership to a club or gym, because it could be rather expensive. Check before you commit. \r\n\r\nListen to your gut on Thursday. If you get an intuition to call someone, follow through. It could be worth your while. \r\n\r\nAre you ready for a fresh start? The new moon on Friday, again in your social sector, could see you committing to a community project or moving in new circles.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=1]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff99ff]Taurus ♉[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"It’s your turn in the spotlight with the sun moving into your sector of career and ambition on Monday for a four-week stay. This is a chance to take stock and set your priorities. What do you want to accomplish? Having clear goals can be half the battle, and persevering despite obstacles can see you doing very well. If you’re ready for a new beginning, this week’s new moon can help. \r\n\r\nThis week can also have a romantic quality, because lovely Venus links with jovial Jupiter on Thursday and angles toward feisty Mars on Sunday. Ready for a date? Thursday can be warm and delightful, especially if you’re hoping to get closer to someone for the first time. But the atmosphere can be just about perfect for any social event. \r\n\r\nThe weekend is a tad different, though, as an awkward angle suggests an attraction of opposites. With Venus in the watery sign of Pisces and Mars in the fiery sign of Sagittarius, there may be little that connects you, yet this could be what draws you together.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=2]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#66cc33]Gemini ♊[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With the sun moving into your sector of far horizons on Monday, this week could see you ready for travel adventures. The coming four weeks are a chance to enjoy a short trip or even an early vacation. \r\n\r\n But this is also a time when you may be reaching out for more in terms of opportunities and experiences. You might also feel restless and eager to ditch your regular routines and do something different. Resist the urge to act on impulse, though. Planning ahead is the better way. \r\n\r\nThere is still a focus on an intense zone. And while you may still be dealing with key issues, a lightness and buoyancy can help you handle this with greater ease. \r\n\r\nAre you thinking of pooling resources with someone? A delightful Venus-Jupiter connection could see you linking up and making plans. If you do go ahead, it could be a worthwhile venture.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=3]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3399ff]Cancer ♋[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"The emphasis on your sector of shared resources could encourage you to take stock of financial matters and think about how you might improve on them. And with a new moon this week, this can be the ideal time for a fresh start, whether you want to consolidate debts or get your money working harder for you in general. Even so, it might be tempting to splurge when you’re with friends, especially midweek. Give yourself a limit if you can. \r\n\r\nRegarding relationships, a positive Venus connection midweek may be perfect for an outing with a friend or breaking the ice regarding a budding romance. This lively connection could see you enjoying each other’s company more frequently. \r\n\r\nThe weekend looks lively. Chatty Mercury aligns with dynamic Mars, which can put you in an assertive mood. This can be great for all kinds of business or commercial activities and bring new opportunities your way.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=4]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#ff9933]Leo ♌[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"The sun glides into your relationship sector on Monday to light up this area and bring more opportunities for socializing and generally enjoying life. While you may still be busy getting out and about, this influence can help you relax and be just the tonic you need. And with the new moon in this same zone on Friday, this is a perfect opportunity to kick-start a romantic bond. Are you ready to break the ice? If so, this is the time to go for it. \r\n\r\nPleasure options could tempt you as feisty Mars continues its journey through your leisure zone. With Venus angling toward Mars over the weekend, you might be tempted by someone who has a mysterious quality. Would you get along? Perhaps the only way to find out is to go on a date. \r\n\r\nYour work and lifestyle sector is still very much in focus, so you’ll likely have a lot on your plate, which is why some pampering and a few well-deserved treats would perk you up.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=5]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#339933]Virgo ♍[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"After an intense focus on your sector of creativity, things could feel a little easier in this sector. And while you may be continuing to process through a key issue, there could be signs of progress that give you confidence and spur you on. \r\n\r\nLifestyle issues may be more emphasized this week as the radiant sun enters this zone for four weeks. It joins Mercury, which could inspire you to take a closer look at your routines and consider which ones are working and which aren’t. \r\n\r\nThis is your chance to experiment with various ways of doing things. For instance, if you’re eager to diet or exercise, try different options so you can settle on those that suit you best. The new moon in this sector on Friday is perfect for initiating new habits and letting go of those that no longer serve your best interests. \r\n\r\nThere is also a pleasantly romantic transit on Thursday that could see you and another enjoying a wonderful date.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=6]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#3366ff]Libra ♎[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"If past weeks have been a little intense, the focus on your leisure zone could be just the tonic. You really deserve to get out and enjoy life and indulge in those things that recharge you. \r\n\r\nEven so, midweek could be a tad disruptive as a restless sun-Uranus angle suggests an event may not go ahead as planned. Be flexible and you’ll find something else to take its place. \r\n\r\nLuscious Venus angles toward jovial Jupiter on Thursday, so you may be in the mood to entertain at your place. If so, this could be quite the occasion. Whether you invite friends, work colleagues, or both, this is one of those events that you might be eager to repeat. \r\n\r\nIf you’re in the mood for romance, there are options, and one of them could take you by surprise. With lovely Venus angling toward feisty Mars, you could fall for someone who has a very different personality than you. Even so, it could work.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=7]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#8B0000]Scorpio ♏[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"You’ve likely had a hectic few weeks, and with the sun moving into your domestic sector, it’s time to step back from life. This can give you a chance to reflect on all that’s happened and come to some conclusions. It’s also a chance to enjoy some self-care and nurturing and spend time with your nearest and dearest. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve felt misunderstood for any reason, particularly after the intense Saturn-Pluto transit, this homey energy can soothe and heal. \r\n\r\nA delightful Venus-Jupiter connection on Thursday will linger for a day or so and could see you getting on well with someone. This open-minded person is likely very compassionate and sensitive, and you may feel you can talk to them about anything. Could there be romantic potential here? Yes. \r\n\r\nAre you ready to make a few changes? The new moon on Friday is the perfect time to kick-start any household or family projects.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=8]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#FFFF00]Sagittarius ♐[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"While financial issues may still be on your mind, the presence of upbeat Jupiter can assist by connecting you with the right people and advice. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a positive focus on your sector of communication with the sun moving in on Monday and joining chatty Mercury. This can be helpful for negotiating and sorting out issues and finding a compromise. Still, it helps to be careful midweek because there could be some disruption to your plans. With a little flexibility, you can work around this. \r\n\r\nA delightful tie between creative Venus and jovial Jupiter on Thursday could inspire you to purchase something for the home. If you have a penchant for vintage items, you could pick up the perfect piece. \r\n\r\nThe new moon on Friday can be excellent for closing deals, signing contracts, or launching a website or blog.

The sun’s presence in your financial sector as of Monday can shine the light of awareness on money matters. This can be a call to take stock and sort out anything that’s bothering you. If you’re ready to commit to a budget or new financial habits, the new moon on Friday is the perfect time to do so. \r\n\r\nEven so, avoid splurging midweek, because you could regret an impulsive buy almost immediately. \r\n\r\nYour social life looks positive this week, with an endearing Venus-Jupiter tie encouraging you to attend an event that you might enjoy very much. Whether you’re spoken for or solo, it could bring a golden opportunity your way. \r\n\r\nFinally, chatty Mercury’s tie to feisty Mars on Saturday can be a call to listen to your gut when choosing a new gadget or other key purchase.\"[/i][i][size=xx-small][url=https://www.horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-weekly.aspx?sign=10]>>Source[/url][/size][/i]\r\n\r\n[*][b][color=#9966ff]Aquarius ♒[/color][/b]\r\n[i]\"With the sun easing into your sign on Monday after spending some time in a more private zone, you could feel back in control. Your vitality and confidence can increase, and this can leave you more upbeat, especially if events have left you a tad drained over recent weeks. \r\n\r\nThis is your opportunity to indulge in those things that have personal meaning for you. And if others accuse you of being selfish, don’t listen to them. Focus on those people, projects, and situations that bring you the most happiness and you won’t go wrong. \r\n\r\nAre you ready for a new beginning? The new moon in your sign on Friday is the best of the year for you. It’s a chance to write down your intentions.

This is an opportunity to clear away emotional baggage, tie up loose ends, and find closure on situations that have been dragging on for too long. And if you need a chance to rest, this is the ideal time to do so. \r\n\r\nThere’s a new moon in this same sector on Friday, making this a chance to take up a spiritual practice such as meditation, yoga, or anything else that can help bring you peace of mind. If you’re ready to keep a dream journal or use journaling as a daily practice to unblock the creative flow, this is the best time to begin. \r\n\r\nSomeone may have romantic designs on you this week.
